The technology in the gas conversion process was pioneered by Chicago-based company, LanzaTech, with whom ArcelorMittal has entered a long-term partnership. The technology licensed by LanzaTech uses microbes that feed on carbon monoxide to produce bioethanol. The bioethanol will be used as transport fuel or potentially in the production of plastics.  This is the first installation of its kind on an industrial scale in Europe and once complete, annual production of bioethanol at Ghent is expected to reach around 80 million litres, which will yield an annual CO2 saving equivalent to putting 100,000 electrical cars on the road. The new installation will create up to 500 construction jobs over the next two years and 20 to 30 new permanent direct jobs. Commissioning and first production is expected by mid-2020.  The application of this microbial gas conversion system significantly advances ArcelorMittal\u2019s carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) capabilities and enhances steel\u2019s role in the circular economy.

Currently within the EU, energy-intensive industries including steel producers, pay a carbon cost under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). But this does not apply to steel producers from markets outside the EU who can sell steel with comparable or often significantly higher, carbon emissions, at a lower price. The result is that steel production is moving to non-EU countries where carbon emissions legislation is often less strict, undermining efforts to combat climate change.   However, with a CBA, when steel comes into the EU, the carbon costs that European producers pay would be added to the imported steel, equalising the cost of carbon for every producer to create a fair market and, crucially, encouraging investment in lower-emissions steel production.  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe \u2013 Flat Products says: \u201cThe EU\u2019s commitment to reduce its carbon emissions to net-zero should be applauded and we hope that decision makers across Europe will back the proposals as they really could hold the key to unlocking solutions that could put a stop to carbon emissions. The climate challenge is unprecedented, and bold action is needed.\u201d  ArcelorMittal believes that a CBA can be applied in various ways, as long as it neutralizes the disparities in carbon costs between domestic products and imports, and incentivizes the transition to low carbon steel production. In the manifesto, ArcelorMittal highlights how the best-designed carbon border adjustment could work effectively:  Producers exporting to the EU should be charged the same marginal carbon emissions cost as European producers pay under the ETS. This should serve as a catalyst to other countries to introduce their own carbon schemes and invest in technologies to decarbonise.  The CBA should initially be applied to primary goods, rather than end products like household appliances and everyday tools. This is the most practical way to introduce the CBA.  To be effective, free allocation of ETS allowances, which are gradually being phased out by the European Commission, should be maintained in the first stage of the CBA, alongside compensation for high energy costs as an indirect result of the ETS. This is crucial to enabling European steel to stay competitive and ensure a smooth transition without disruption.  He says: \u201cThere are of course challenges that will need to be overcome. For example, some have argued that there is the risk of contravening international trade rules. However, the establishment of a border adjustment is compatible with international trade rules, allowing members to adopt measures necessary for the protection of the environment or relating to the conservation of natural resources providing that such measures do not constitute arbitrary discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail. But this will only work if the policies are well-designed and drafted in the right way.\u201d   He also says: \u201cWe know we need to invest more to decarbonise our industry and we truly believe we can be a world leader in low carbon steel. But in order to do so, we need to have a CBA to create a landscape where others also contribute equally to a carbon-neutral world. The time to do this is now, with the proceeds allowing further investment in large-scale green technologies that lead to a new era of low carbon emissions.\u201d   For more information, to read the manifesto and view our short animation on the CBA, see here:  https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/sustainability\/climate-action-in-europe  Contact information \u2013 ArcelorMittal Europe communications  [email protected]  +44 203 214 2876  [email protected]  +44 203 214 2882","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/europe-s-proposed-carbon-border-adjustment-could-hold-the-key-to-breakthrough-on-co2-emissions-reduction\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

Building on the company\u2019s work that has demonstrated that the steelmaking process can become carbon neutral, the report publishes details of the ground-breaking work underway to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030 before reaching net zero in 2050.  The company is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral routes for steelmaking: Smart Carbon, and an innovative DRI-based route.  Smart Carbon is a carbon-neutral steelmaking route that leverages all clean energies \u2013 circular carbon, clean electricity and carbon capture and storage (CCS) - within the high temperature-controlled reduction environment of ironmaking. In its first phase, Smart Carbon will primarily use circular carbon.  Reaching carbon-neutral steelmaking via DRI involves moving from using predominantly natural gas, to hydrogen as the key reductant in ironmaking. As this hydrogen becomes \u2018green\u2019, the steelmaking process comes close to carbon neutrality.  While both the Smart Carbon route and the DRI-based route have the potential to deliver carbon -neutral steel by 2050, the important difference between the two routes is that Smart Carbon can deliver results sooner, through its use of complementary technologies which enable incremental progress. Uniquely, Smart Carbon has the potential not only to provide carbon-neutral steel, but also carbon-neutral cement, and the building blocks to make recycled carbon materials to replace polyethylene-based plastics. Smart Carbon can also contribute to CO2 removal, through the increased use of circular carbon, using sustainable biomass and waste, combined with scaling up CCS.  By investing in both routes \u2013 and in recognition of the need to act now to combat climate change - this means ArcelorMittal Europe can significantly reduce scope 1 CO2 emissions* \u2013 which include all process emissions - by 2030 over a 2018 baseline, while waiting for the large-scale, affordable renewable energy needed for hydrogen-based steelmaking.  ArcelorMittal Europe\u2019s 2030 target therefore combines Smart Carbon technologies and increased scrap usage, specifically by developing new ways to increase the use of low-quality scrap metal \u2013 which is hard to recycle - in the primary steel production process.  In the longer-term, both routes have the potential to leverage all three clean energies to achieve carbon neutrality, namely:    * clean electricity (generated by sources such as solar and wind),   * circular carbon (making use of biowaste materials, such as sustainable forestry and agriculture residues, to produce bioenergy)   * carbon capture and storage (capturing CO2 before it is emitted, transporting it and storing it safely underground).    Commenting on the report, Aditya Mittal, President and CFO, ArcelorMittal, and CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said:  \u201cClimate change is one of the greatest challenges facing us all. Understandably, much attention is currently focussed on navigating the unexpected and unprecedented outbreak of Covid-19. However, climate change remains a huge long-term challenge that will require diligent attention and progress for decades to come. And like Covid-19, it is not something that one country or one company can solve alone. Carbon emissions also know no border, so it will take a global effort, with all nations and companies playing their part.  \u201cArcelorMittal Europe is doing a lot of work to develop a path to net zero. The technologies we are working on have the potential to make a big impact. Indeed, steel should and can play a leading role in achieving the vision for Europe as outlined in the Green Deal. Our research and development team are one of the best in the industry and relish solving complex problems. But it needs a team effort. The support the EU and member states can give to ensure we have well-designed policy to make large-scale, competitive, carbon-neutral steelmaking a reality, is critical.\u201d  ArcelorMittal Europe has industrial-scale demonstration projects under construction for every part of its carbon-neutral roadmap. The company is building industrial-scale demonstration plants at its operations in Belgium (Carbalyst\u00ae and Torero), France (3D and IGAR in Dunkirk). In Hamburg, Germany, we are in the design and funding phase prior to the investment decision, of an industrial-scale project to use hydrogen instead of natural gas in the direct reduction of iron ore (DRI). These demonstration plants will allow the company to scale-up technologies that will be used in the Smart Carbon and DRI-based routes. The progress made has also been possible thanks to financial support from EU member states and European Union funding. ArcelorMittal Europe is now in the process of applying for funding for a further six projects.   While some of the technologies that feature in ArcelorMittal Europe\u2019s roadmap will be ready for commercial-scale use by 2025, and by 2030 many of the Smart Carbon technologies can be mature and partially deployed across our facilities in Europe, the report also highlights the need for the right policy framework to enable European steelmaking to contribute to the EU\u2019s climate targets, particularly given the costs involved. In total, the estimated investment needed for ArcelorMittal Europe to fully implement Smart Carbon is \u20ac15-25bn and \u20ac30-40bn for the DRI-based route. An additional \u20ac15\u2013200bn would be required for the associated clean energy infrastructure (see report for more detail).  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe \u2013 Flat Products, explained:  \u201cI am proud of the work that has brought us this far in our efforts to create Europe\u2019s first and largest carbon-neutral steelmaker. Our progress would not have been possible without the many partners we have on our Smart Carbon and innovative DRI projects. Today, the biggest barrier to transitioning to carbon-neutral steel, beyond the necessary technologies reaching commercial maturity, is the absence of the right market conditions. The financial costs of realising carbon-neutral steelmaking are undeniably huge. However, with a shift in market conditions brought about by having the right policies in place, European steelmakers will be able to unlock the means to reduce emissions from steel globally, while also ensuring the European steel industry remains competitive.\u201d  The medium-term market conditions needed include:    1. Creating an environment where carbon-neutral steel is more competitive than steel which is not carbon neutral         2. A fair competitive landscape that accounts for the global nature of the steel market, addressing domestic, import and export steel dynamics, as well as the distinction between primary and secondary sources to make steel.         3. Access to sustainable finance, to innovate and make long-term investments.         4. Access to abundant, affordable clean energy: the scale of the steel industry\u2019s energy needs are such that concerted cross-sector and government efforts will be required to develop the necessary clean energy infrastructure.         5. Public instruments to accelerate innovative technology deployment to transition to carbon neutral steelmaking.    The report also reiterates the company\u2019s position that a Carbon Border Adjustment should be introduced in the European Union, which would ensure that EU-produced steel and imported steel tonnes in direct competition would have an equal carbon cost, creating a fair market and, crucially, encouraging investment in lower-emissions steel production.  ArcelorMittal Europe announced its target to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, in December 2019, and its ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050, in June 2019.  The ArcelorMittal group will publish its 2030 target later this year.   *ArcelorMittal Europe 30% CO2 reduction target includes: ArcelorMittal Europe \u2013 Flat Products, ArcelorMittal Europe \u2013 Long Products, and Industeel  To read the report and view a short film about our roadmap, visit https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/sustainability\/climate-action-in-europe  To view our Carbon Border Adjustment animation, \u2018Creating a low-carbon world, the case for a Carbon Border Adjustment\u2019 visit https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T-iJeVoa7w0","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-sets-out-path-to-net-zero-by-2050-with-pioneering-technologies-at-the-forefront-of-the-company-s-roadmap-for-carbon-neutral-steelmaking\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

As the world\u2019s leading steel company, we believe we have a responsibility to lead the efforts to decarbonise the steel-making process, which today has a significant carbon footprint.   \u201cSteel will remain a vital material for our world and indeed is the most circular of all materials. Our challenge is to be able to make steel using clean energy technologies* on a commercial scale, while remaining competitive in the global steel industry.  \u201cWe are working on various pilot technologies which have excellent potential. In Hamburg, where we own and operate Europe\u2019s only DRI-EAF facility, we will test not only the ability of hydrogen to reduce the iron-ore and form DRI, but also then test that carbon-free DRI in the EAF in the actual steel-making process.  \u201cHydrogen has a lot of potential but given the significant transition cost, we also believe in working on solutions for the traditional integrated route. This essentially follows the bio-energy, carbon capture and utilisation and storage route, which as stressed by both the IPCC and the IEA will be critical to achieving net zero by 2050. What is also interesting about this route is that it has the potential not only to provide carbon neutral steel, but also other products that will help the chemical industry make plastics in a carbon neutral way.   \u201cCritical to turning the target into reality will be policy to enable steel to remain competitive while decarbonizing \u2013 particularly given every region of the world is moving at a different pace. We intend to actively engage with governments to chart a way forward that enables the steel industry to make meaningful progress through carefully designed policy that protects against carbon leakage.\u201d  ArcelorMittal has identified two low-emissions steelmaking routes, both of which have the potential to lead to carbon-neutral steelmaking:    * The Hydrogen-DRI route, which uses hydrogen as a reducing agent. A demonstration plant in Hamburg, where ArcelorMittal owns Europe\u2019s only operational DRI-EAF plant, is currently planned with a targeted start-up in 2023.     * The Smart Carbon route is centred around modifying the blast furnace route to create carbon neutral steelmaking through the use of circular carbon - in the form of sustainable biomass or carbon containing waste streams - and carbon capture and use (CCU) and storage (CCS). ArcelorMittal is well advanced on constructing several commercial-scale projects to test and prove a range of Smart Carbon technologies. Start-up target for key projects is targeted in 2022.    While both routes have the potential to deliver carbon-neutral steel by 2050, we believe that Smart Carbon can deliver results sooner, and make a meaningful contribution to CO2 emissions reduction this decade, while industrial scale production from the Hydrogen-DRI route is unlikely to be significant before 2030 due to the current high costs.  The Company has also previously outlined the policy framework environment it believes is required for carbon-neutral steelmaking to become a reality, which includes:    1. A global level playing field which avoids the risk of carbon leakage through mechanisms such as green border adjustments   2. Access to abundant and affordable clean energy   3. Policies which support the development of the necessary clean energy infrastructure   4. Access to sustainable finance for low-emissions steelmaking, and   5. Policies which accelerate the transition to a circular economy.    ArcelorMittal will set out further detail in support of its 2050 net zero target in its second climate action report, which is anticipated to be published before the end of 2020.  ArcelorMittal is a member of the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) and is an active member of the ETC\u2019s Net Zero Steel Initiative underway in partnership with the World Economic Forum. ArcelorMittal is also actively engaged with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) to define an achievable SBT for the steel industry taking into account the two distinct routes in operation today.  *In its Climate Action Report and Europe Climate Action Report, ArcelorMittal refers to three clean energy vectors: clean electricity, circular carbon, and CCS.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-sets-2050-group-carbon-emissions-target-of-net-zero\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

These initiatives range from our flagship Smart Carbon projects, such as Torero (transforming biomass into bio-coal to replace the use of coal in the blast furnace) and Carbalyst (capturing carbon-rich blast furnace waste gas and converting it into bio-ethanol, which can then be used to make low-carbon chemical products) to capturing hydrogen-rich waste gases from the steelmaking process and injecting them into the blast furnace to reduce coal use.  These effort-intensive investments result in considerable CO2 savings, which can be passed onto customers in the form of the steel industry\u2019s first-ever certification scheme. CO2 savings are aggregated, independently assured, and then converted into XCarb\u2122 green steel certificates using a conversion factor that represents the average CO2 intensity of integrated steelmaking in Europe. The scheme therefore provides customers with the opportunity to buy certificates attached to their physical orders of steel, enabling them to report a reduction in their Scope 3 carbon emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.

In Germany, the group already operates Europe\u2019s only DRI-EAF plant in Hamburg, where the switch to using hydrogen instead of natural gas in the iron ore reduction process is being prepared. The objective is to reach industrial commercial maturity of the technology by 2025, initially producing 100,000 tonnes of sponge iron a year.  Background  To implement the projects, ArcelorMittal is planning to gradually adapt production in Bremen and Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt in order to be able to competitively manufacture carbon-neutral, high-quality steel using hydrogen in the iron ore reduction process.  This year, two blast furnaces \u2013 one in Bremen and one in Eisenhuttenstadt - will be converted to inject natural gas, reducing the use of coal in the iron ore reduction process and thereby further reducing CO2 emissions.  As a next step, innovative DRI-EAF plants are to be set up at both locations. In Bremen, ArcelorMittal initially plans to use natural gas for the DRI, and later hydrogen from electrolysis; the hydrogen is to be made available as part of the regional North German Clean Hydrogen Coastline network. The sponge iron produced in the Bremen DRI unit will initially supply the steelworks in Bremen and Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt, until the regional hydrogen cluster in East Brandenburg can also supply the Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt site with sufficient hydrogen. In the transition phase, the additional hydrogen required in Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt will be generated from natural gas with the help of a pyrolysis plant that will be built on the steel plant\u2019s premises. To secure the future supply of hydrogen, both sites are to be integrated into the European hydrogen network in the long term via the regional hydrogen networks.  ArcelorMittal has set itself the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 30 percent by 2030 in Europe and producing carbon-neutral steel by 2050. To this end, ArcelorMittal is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology routes, Smart Carbon and an innovative DRI-based route.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-plans-major-investment-in-german-sites-to-accelerate-co2-emissions-reduction-strategy-and-leverage-the-hydrogen-grid\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

The development is the result of a memorandum of understanding signed today with the Government of Spain that will see an investment of \u20ac1 billion in the construction of a green hydrogen direct reduced iron (DRI) plant at its plant in Gij\u00f3n, as well as a new hybrid electric arc furnace (EAF).  By 2025, the Sestao plant \u2013 which manufactures a range of flat steel products for the automotive and construction sectors, and general industry - will produce 1.6 million tonnes of zero carbon-emissions steel by:    1. Changing the metallic input by increasing the proportion of circular, recycled scrap, and using green hydrogen-produced DRI from Gij\u00f3n in its two existing EAFs.   2. Powering all steelmaking assets (EAFs, rolling mill, finishing lines) with renewable electricity.   3. Introducing several key emerging technologies that will replace the small, remaining use of fossil fuel in the steelmaking process with carbon-neutral energy inputs, such as sustainable biomass or green hydrogen.    Central to this development will be the construction of a 2.3 million-tonne green hydrogen DRI unit in Gij\u00f3n. Around 1 million tonnes of DRI will be transported to Sestao to be used a feedstock for its two EAFs.  The national and the Basque government\u2019s support in this project is crucial, firstly from a funding perspective, given the significant cost associated with the transition to carbon-neutral steelmaking. Secondly, because it will enable ArcelorMittal to have access to green hydrogen supplied through a consortium of companies that will cooperate in the construction of the infrastructure required in order to produce hydrogen in the Iberian Peninsula using solar\u2011powered electrolysis and to transport it directly through a network of pipelines. The initiative involves the construction of multiple large-scale solar farms, with hydrogen produced in situ and with the corresponding impact in terms of employment.  In addition to the investments in the DRI and EAF installations in Gij\u00f3n, ArcelorMittal will invest \u20ac50 million in Sestao. This will fund the introduction of key emerging technologies required to bring the plant to zero carbon-emissions, supporting 1.6 million tonnes of production.  Looking further ahead, the company has also committed to achieving net zero[2] at the Sestao plant as soon as possible.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:  \u201cIt is widely understood that for the world to achieve net-zero by 2050, faster progress over the next decade is essential. Having announced a net-zero target for 2050, we therefore set ourselves the challenge to identify how we could take an existing steel plant to zero carbon-emissions within the next five years. Our teams have been working incredibly hard to turn this ambition into the plan that we have announced today. This is a hugely significant development and demonstrates the strength of innovation embedded in our people, our unparalleled technology leadership, and what can be achieved through investment in existing steelmaking infrastructure. It means ArcelorMittal will be the first company in the world to be in a position to offer its customers meaningful volumes of zero carbon-emissions steel.  \u201cThe ability of the Sestao plant to become the world\u2019s first zero carbon-emissions steel plant would not be possible without the support and partnership of the Spanish government. This is a project that will require the support of many different partners to succeed; the plan hinges on the supply of affordable, mass-scale hydrogen, access to sustainable finance and a supportive legal framework that allows us to be competitive globally. The Spanish government has embraced the opportunity and developed clearly defined plans to transition the country to having the energy infrastructure that the green economy will require. ArcelorMittal plans to switch Sestao to renewable electricity. This, together with the green DRI and hydrogen feeding the burners, will result in the Sestao plant achieving zero carbon-emissions.

The MoU states the commitment of ArcelorMittal and the Government of Spain to transition towards a decarbonised steel industry. ArcelorMittal will introduce new manufacturing processes that contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions. It will also further intensify its R&D capabilities in Spain to support the new project and innovation requirements. The Government of Spain will promote reforms and investments to support the development and growth of a strong, more competitive and sustainable industrial sector, as well as endeavouring to provide maximum financial support for the project, in line with Spanish legislation and European Union regulations.

The initiative involves the construction of multiple large-scale solar farms, with hydrogen produced in situ and with the corresponding impact in terms of employment.  The Gij\u00f3n DRI will also feed the company\u2019s Sestao plant, situated approximately 250km from Gij\u00f3n, where production is already entirely from the electric arc furnace route. This means that by 2025 ArcelorMittal Sestao will produce 1.6 million tonnes of steel and be the world\u2019s first full-scale steel plant to achieve zero carbon-emissions.   Speaking at the signing of the MoU in Gij\u00f3n, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:   \u201cIt is widely understood that for the world to achieve net-zero by 2050, faster progress over the next decade is essential. The MoU we have signed today will play an important role in doing exactly that. The construction of the new green hydrogen DRI plant in Gij\u00f3n will not only enable us to reduce emissions from our Spanish operations by half but will also result in the world\u2019s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant in Sestao.  \u201cClearly, this is a project that will require the support of many different partners to succeed; our plan hinges on the supply of affordable, mass-scale hydrogen, access to sustainable finance and a supportive legal framework that allows us to be competitive globally. The Spanish government has clearly defined plans to transition the country to a decarbonised economy and I have been impressed by the progress made in creating the energy infrastructure that this green economy will require.  \u201cAs a large emitter, the steel industry can make a vital contribution to achieving net zero by 2050. This project demonstrates what is achievable.\u201d  Expressing their support for the plan, Spain\u2019s Minister of Industry Mar\u00eda Reyes Maroto said:   \u201cThe Government of Spain and the ArcelorMittal Group fully agree that the transition towards a decarbonised economy is an essential objective for Spain, and they both recognise the industrial, technological and regulatory challenges that this transition poses for Spanish industry, as well as the opportunities it offers, in terms of innovation and improved competitiveness. The Government of Spain, through the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, will strongly support a new framework of institutional relations between the Government and the ArcelorMittal Group, because the Government of Spain recognises the importance of the steel industry for the development of the Spanish economy, while also recognising that the industry needs a stable and predictable legal framework as the best tool to enable it to be competitive and attain the targets set in terms of energy transition and digitalisation, both at national and at European Union level. In this regard, the Government of Spain is exploring regulatory instruments to support the industry in the transition process, such as the compensation programmes for electricity-intensive industries, tools to promote improved energy efficiency, public financing for digitalisation, instruments to promote industrial investments, training programmes and strategies to promote the use of clean fuels.\u201d  ArcelorMittal Europe has a target to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, and an ambition to be net-zero by 2050. The company is pursuing two pathways to achieve this: Innovative DRI and Smart Carbon.  ArcelorMittal Spain\u2019s operations are already contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions from the company\u2019s steelmaking operations. Earlier this year, ArcelorMittal Asturias completed its project to capture hydrogen-rich coke oven gas and re-inject it into the blast furnace, replacing some of the coke used in the blast furnace. Deploying this innovative technology will result in a reduction in CO2 emissions of 125,000 tonnes a year, equivalent to the emissions generated by the annual consumption of 84,000 Spanish households with individual natural gas-based heating systems. These CO2 savings have already generated XCarb\u2122 green steel certificates, which were launched by the company in March 2021, allowing ArcelorMittal customers to report a reduction in their Scope 3 CO2 emissions.  [1] On a Scope 1 and 2 basis.  [2] Should green hydrogen not be available at affordable rates by the end of 2025, natural gas would be used to power the DRI furnace. This would still result in a very significant reduction in CO2 emissions, of 4 million tonnes, approximately 45%.

An innovative chemical process, developed by SEKISUI CHEMICAL in Japan, then converts the waste CO2 into carbon monoxide rich Synthesis Gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen). The Synthesis Gas is then returned to the steelmaking process as an alternative reduction agent for iron ore, thereby lowering the volume of fossil resources required in the steelmaking process.  Key to this work is SEKISUI CHEMICAL\u2019s innovative technology that converts CO2 to carbon monoxide at high yield. To date, producing carbon monoxide in large volumes from CO2 has been very challenging. SEKISUI CHEMICAL aims to demonstrate the ability to scale up its new technology through this partnership with ArcelorMittal.  The technology will initially be trialled over a three-year period at one of ArcelorMittal\u2019s research and development laboratories located in Asturias, Spain, commencing in the third quarter of 2021. The investment cost of the project is USD1.9 million.  Pinakin Chaubal, Chief Technology Officer at ArcelorMittal, said:  \u201cThis is an exciting albeit early stage technology which complements our existing carbon capture and re-use or storage technology (CCUS) initiatives. Successfully decarbonising steelmaking will involve multiple technologies and we expect CCUS technologies to have an important role to play. This view is shared by the International Energy Agency which said in its recent \u2018Net Zero by 2050\u2019 report that CCUS technologies will be attached to over 50% of steel production by 2050.\u201d  Katsunori Mukai, Director of Corporate R&D at SEKISUI CHEMICAL said:  \u201cSEKISUI CHEMICAL has been developing basic technologies for sustainable societies. One of them is focussed on giving \u2018LIFE to CO2\u2019 by enabling carbon recycling in manufacturing industries. In this inter-industry partnership with ArcelorMittal, we are aiming to help reduce the carbon emissions of the steel industry.\u201d  ArcelorMittal has a target of reducing CO2 emissions in Europe by 30 per cent by 2030 and producing carbon-neutral steel group-wide by 2050. To this end, ArcelorMittal is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology pathways, Smart Carbon and Innovative-DRI. Within its Smart Carbon pathway, ArcelorMittal is already developing and deploying other carbon capture and re-use technologies including Carbalyst, a \u20ac165 million project in Ghent, Belgium, which converts carbon-rich steelmaking waste gases into bio-ethanol, and IGAR, an industrial-scale pilot project in Dunkirk, France, to capture waste CO2 and waste hydrogen from the steelmaking process and convert it into synthetic gas to replace the use of fossil fuel in steelmaking.

The intended investments will reduce annual CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal\u2019s Hamilton, Ontario operations by approximately 3 million tonnes, which represents approximately 60% of emissions, within the next seven years. This means the Hamilton plant will transition away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) \u2013 Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint.  ArcelorMittal will introduce new manufacturing processes that contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions and deliver other positive environmental impacts including the elimination of emissions and flaring from coke making and ironmaking operations.  The investment is contingent on support from the governments of Canada and Ontario. Today the Government of Canada announced it will invest CAD$400 million in the project. The Company is in discussions with the Government of Ontario regarding its support.  The announcement was made at an event in ArcelorMittal Dofasco\u2019s plant in Hamilton, which was attended by ArcelorMittal CEO Aditya Mittal, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard, Canada\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne and Minister of Labour Filomena Tassi.  At the heart of the plan is a 2 million tonne capacity DRI facility and an EAF facility capable of producing 2.4 million tonnes of high-quality steel through its existing secondary metallurgy and secondary casting facilities. Modification of the existing EAF facility and continuous casters will also be undertaken to align productivity, quality and energy capabilities between all assets in the new footprint.  The new DRI and EAF will be in production before the end of 2028.  This project contributes to the sustainability of well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing and is also expected to support as many as 2,500 jobs during the engineering and construction phases. It will also support ArcelorMittal Dofasco\u2019s customers decarbonization ambitions while further enhancing ArcelorMittal Dofasco\u2019s capability to support the most demanding product segments including automotive exposed, advanced high strength steels, and consumer packing.  This new production route for ArcelorMittal Dofasco will provide a technically advanced manufacturing environment for operations, maintenance, and technology staff to work in, with improved health and safety. New positions, training, and development will be provided for employees moving from existing business units to new assets, with approximately 160,000 training hours required to transition our workforce to the new footprint.  Expressing Canada\u2019s support for the plan, Deputy and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland said:  \u201cOur government has been steadfast in defending and championing our steel workers. Today\u2019s announcement, through the Net Zero Accelerator, is about investing in the low-carbon transformation of Canadian industry, taking serious action in the global fight against climate change, and supporting good middle-class jobs in Hamilton.

We are very pleased to be in partnership with the Government of Canada - as partners, we all recognize that it is vital to accelerate our carbon emissions reduction and strengthen our climate action. Indeed progress in the next decade is vital if the world is to reach net zero by 2050.  \u201cThis project is part of ArcelorMittal\u2019s new global 25% CO2 2030 emissions reduction target which was announced yesterday in our second climate action report. DRI-EAF technology, such as that being introduced in Dofasco, is at the heart of our new target although we do also continue to develop our smart carbon technology route. Transitioning from the blast furnace route to the DRI-route, offers an immediate significant reduction in emissions in the first phase through natural gas and then in a second phase, which we call innovative DRI, harnessing green hydrogen or other Smart Carbon technologies.  \u201cThis is the first significant decarbonization project we have announced outside Europe and again reflects ArcelorMittal\u2019s determination to lead the decarbonization of the steel industry. Across the company our people are highly motivated to demonstrate that steel can reach net zero and will be the core material for a carbon-neutral world. This project in Dofasco is a very significant and important milestone in this journey.\u201d  Highlighting the transformative impact of the announcement, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard said:  \u201cThe Government of Canada\u2019s investment accelerates the realization of low carbon steelmaking in Canada.

The new steelmaking stream also sustains well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing in Ontario, with the opportunity for our highly skilled employees to work in the most technically advanced Steelmaking assets in North America. The company\u2019s bayfront property has been re-imagined and we are well on the way to a significant and broad reduction in environmental impacts, contributing to the health and sustainability of our community, the environment and the economy.\u201d  ArcelorMittal has an ambition to be net zero by 2050. Yesterday the Company published its second group Climate Action Report in which it set a new 2030 global carbon emissions intensity reduction target of 25%. It has also increased its European 2030 carbon emissions intensity target to 35%, from 30%. ArcelorMittal estimates the cost of achieving its global 2030 carbon reduction target is c. US$10 billion and believes government funding support of approximately 50% is required to enable the Company to remain competitive regionally and globally through the transition period given the capital investment required and higher operating costs of low-carbon steelmaking technologies. The Company has developed two technology pathways, Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI, both of which it believes will have an important role to play in helping the Company achieve net zero by 2050.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-and-the-government-of-canada-announce-investment-of-cad-1-765-billion-in-decarbonization-technologies-in-canada\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

A DRI plant uses natural gas, and potentially hydrogen, instead of coal to reduce iron ore, resulting in a large reduction in CO2 emissions compared with blast furnace ironmaking. The two electric furnaces will melt the DRI and scrap steel, which will then be transformed in the steel shop into steel slabs and then further processed into finished products.  Once the DRI and electric furnaces are built, there will be a transition period during which production will move gradually from blast furnace A, to the DRI and electric furnaces, after which blast furnace A will be closed as it reaches the end of its life. By 2030, this will result in a reduction of around three million tonnes of CO2 emissions each year.  The support of both the national and the Flanders governments in this project is crucial given the significant cost associated with the transition to carbon-neutral steelmaking.  Approval from the European Commission for the funding support will also be required.  Smart Carbon and DRI synergies   The DRI plant will operate alongside Gent\u2019s blast furnace B, which restarted production in March 2021 following a significant investment of \u20ac195 million.  Various decarbonisation initiatives, including the commissioning in 2022 of Gent\u2019s Steelanol\/Carbalyst and Torero projects will see annual CO2 emissions reduction of 0.9 million tonnes by 2030.  The combination of the new DRI plant alongside a sustainable, state-of-the-art blast furnace enables the creation of unique synergies in ArcelorMittal Belgium\u2019s roadmap to climate-neutral steelmaking.  Combined, the various initiatives will enable ArcelorMittal Belgium to reduce its CO2 emissions by 3.9 million tonnes per year by 2030 (on a scope 1 and 2 basis, compared with 2018), which is equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 848,172 cars being driven for a year[1]. As a result, ArcelorMittal Belgium will make a significant contribution to ArcelorMittal Europe\u2019s ambition to reduce CO2e emissions intensity by 35% by 2030 and to become carbon neutral by 2050.  Roadmap to 2050  The hybrid model approach of Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI steelmaking in Gent fits into ArcelorMittal Belgium\u2019s CO2 roadmap which consists of three axes:    * Further improvement of material and energy efficiency as well as increased scrap usage   * The implementation of Smart Carbon technologies:     1. Replacing fossil carbon with circular and waste carbon: 'Fresh' raw materials will increasingly be replaced with waste products, in an environmentally and economically feasible way. The Torero project will pre-treat waste wood from container parks to produce bio-coal suitable for the blast furnace process. ArcelorMittal Belgium also has demonstration projects running with plastic waste that could be injected into the blast furnaces in the form of powder or gas.   2. Reforming waste gas into useful chemical compounds: In 2022, ArcelorMittal Belgium will commission a plant (Steelanol\/Carbalyst) to biologically convert gas from the steelmaking process into bioethanol.   3. Separating CO2 for reuse or storage.     * Hydrogen: replacing carbon as a reductant, with hydrogen (ultimately green hydrogen, when it is available commercially).    Alexander De Croo, Prime Minister of Belgium, said:  \u201cTo tackle the climate crisis, we need ambitious action. European countries are leading the way, with clear targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. It is good to see that sectors with a large footprint are also joining the race by investing in innovation that reduces emissions and, in the long term, achieves carbon neutrality. This major investment in new technology by ArcelorMittal is important for the wider Ghent region, for reducing our country's footprint, and shows that decarbonising our economy is a joint effort.\u201d  Jan Jambon, Flemish Minister-President, said:  \u201cWe believe that technological breakthroughs are key in delivering on the climate agenda. The ambitious roadmap brought forward by ArcelorMittal for its site in Ghent is in that sense an opportunity.\u201d  Vincent Van Peteghem, Deputy Prime Minister of the Belgian Government and Belgian Minister of Finance, said:  \u201cIn order for us to enable climate transition for a better, healthier tomorrow it is crucial for government and industry to come together in this crucial pivoting point in time. ArcelorMittal is proving to be a leading example for this transition in our region. This joint effort is not only securing the presence of ArcelorMittal in our region but is also quintessential in lending the Ghent region healthy & clean air for all.\u201d  Hilde Crevits, Deputy Prime Minister of the Flemish Government and Flemish Minister for Economy, Innovation, Work, Social Economy and Agriculture, said:  \u201cArcelorMittal has chosen a ground-breaking and innovative technology that will significantly reduce emissions from one of their blast furnaces, resulting in a 4% reduction of emissions in Flanders. This unique project will serve as an example to the rest of Europe on how to realise the goal of climate neutrality. Simultaneously, it ensures the sustainable creation of jobs and strengthens ArcelorMittal's competitiveness, to the benefit of Flanders\u2019 welfare and prosperity.\u201d  Tinne Van der Straeten, Belgian Minster of Energy, said:  \u201cThis ambitious project shows that industry is a crucial partner to achieve a climate neutral society by 2050. It will be one of the largest climate investments in Belgium that will anchor ArcelorMittal in the Ghent region, that guarantees employment and that will provide low carbon and ultimately carbon neutral steel. Green steels is needed in the switch to 100% renewable energy. What is good for the climate is good for the economy and for everyone.\u201d  Matthias Diependaele, Flemish Minister of Finance and Budget, Housing and Immovable Heritage, said:  \u201cThis investment for ArcelorMittal's infrastructure is a sign of responsible Flemish policy. We are investing in a sustainable future for the country, both in terms of emissions and in securing employment in the port of Ghent.\u201d  Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the third major decarbonisation project we have announced in the past two months, demonstrating how we are taking firm steps to decarbonise our operations and crucially, to accelerate progress in the decade ahead. None of these projects would be possible without government backing, so we are very grateful to the governments of Belgium and Flanders for their ongoing support as we transition to net-zero steelmaking. Today\u2019s announcement of our project to build a 2.5 million-tonne DRI plant that will co-exist with and complement the Smart Carbon pathway in which we are already investing in Gent, is an example of the kind of transformational change we want and need to implement in order to accelerate ArcelorMittal\u2019s journey to net-zero steelmaking.\u201d  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO, ArcelorMittal Europe, said:   \u201cArcelorMittal Europe recently announced a more ambitious target for reducing CO2 emissions, from a 30% to a 35% decrease by 2030. We are able to reduce our environmental impact faster, thanks to projects such as this, which embody the cooperation and innovation that we need in order to succeed. ArcelorMittal Belgium has played a vital role in the European business\u2019 decarbonisation strategy from the outset, and as a result of today\u2019s announcement, we will continue to see it at the forefront as we move closer to net-zero steelmaking.\u201d   Manfred Van Vlierberghe, CEO, ArcelorMittal Belgium, said:  \u201cArcelorMittal Belgium has a passion for sustainability and circularity. We continue to invest and launch new projects in order to remain at the forefront of energy and climate transition. This \u20ac1.1 billion project is a major milestone in our decarbonisation journey. The DRI plant and two electric furnaces will result in a sharp decrease of CO2 emissions while the relined blast furnace will contribute to recycling waste wood and end-of-life plastics. This approach contributes to strengthening our global leadership in terms of CO2 and energy efficiency in the steel sector.\u201d  [1] Calculated using the US EPA greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator - https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/energy\/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-signs-letter-of-intent-with-the-governments-of-belgium-and-flanders-supporting-1-1-billion-investment-in-decarbonisation-technologies-at-its-flagship-gent-plant\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

The project includes the implementation of a flotation system that will enable a significant reduction of silica in the iron ore pellets, facilitating the production of a very high-quality pellet.  The project will deliver a direct annual CO2e reduction of approximately 200,000 tonnes at AMMC\u2019s Port-Cartier pellet plant, equivalent to over 20% of the pellet plant\u2019s total annual CO2e emissions. This reduction in CO2e emissions will be achieved through a reduction in the energy required during the pelletising process.  A DRI plant uses natural gas to reduce iron ore, resulting in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions compared with coal-based blast furnace ironmaking. In Hamburg, Germany, ArcelorMittal is trialing replacing natural gas with hydrogen to make DRI, with its industrial scale pilot project anticipated to be commissioned before the end of 2025. The DRI installations the Company has announced it is developing in Belgium, Canada and Spain are all being constructed to be hydrogen-ready, so as and when green hydrogen is available in sufficient quantities at affordable prices the Company can produce DRI with near zero-carbon emissions.  Approximately 250 jobs are expected to be created during the construction phase of the project in Port-Cartier, which is scheduled to be begin mid-2023 and complete before the end of 2025.  Expressing the Quebec government\u2019s support for the project, Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said:  \u201cWith this project, the Port-Cartier plant will become one of the world's largest producers of direct reduction pellets. The market is increasingly evolving towards this technology. We are therefore ensuring that ArcelorMittal will continue to create wealth in Quebec for many years. We are positioning our regions at the heart of the green economy of tomorrow. My message to companies looking for a place to reduce their GHG emissions is come and see us. We'll help you carry out your projects promptly. Quebec is the best place in the world to invest in the green economy.

From 2025 onwards we will have the capacity to produce ten million tonnes of very high-quality iron oxide pellets, with low silica content and high iron density, which will be highly strategic in the years ahead. This transformation will enable us to reduce our own current emissions by 200,000 tonnes of CO2e per year \u2013 equivalent to removing 57,600 cars from the road each year. Moreover, it will support a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of primary steelmaking. These pellets are the feedstock for DRI-EAF steelmaking, which given its significantly lower carbon footprint is expected to replace a significant amount of blast furnace capacity in the coming decades.

CAD$1.8 billion investment in decarbonisation technologies at ArcelorMittal Dofasco\u2019s plant in Hamilton. As announced in July, 2021, the investment will reduce annual CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal\u2019s Hamilton, Ontario operations by approximately 3 million tonnes, which represents approximately 60% of emissions. This means the Hamilton plant will transition away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) \u2013 Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint.  The project is scheduled to be complete by 2028, although the Company is looking for opportunities to accelerate the project timelines.  The new manufacturing processes contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions and deliver other positive environmental impacts including the elimination of emissions and flaring from coke making and ironmaking operations.  The investment was contingent on support from the governments of Canada and Ontario. In July 2021 the Government of Canada announced it will invest CAD$400 million in the project and today, the Government of Ontario announced it will invest CAD$500 million in the project. This secures project funding and firms up the investment.  Today\u2019s announcement was made at an event in ArcelorMittal Dofasco\u2019s plant in Hamilton, which was attended by ArcelorMittal North America CEO John Brett, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, Minister of Economic Development Job Creation and Trade Vic Fedeli, Minister of Energy Todd Smith and MPP Donna Skelly.  At the heart of the plan is a 2.5 million tonne capacity DRI facility and an EAF facility capable of producing 2.4 million tonnes of high-quality steel through its existing secondary metallurgy and secondary casting facilities. Modification of the existing EAF facility and continuous casters will also be undertaken to align productivity, quality and energy capabilities between all assets in the new footprint.  This project contributes to the sustainability of well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing and is also expected to support as many as 2,500 jobs during the engineering and construction phases. It will also support ArcelorMittal Dofasco\u2019s customers decarbonisation ambitions while further enhancing ArcelorMittal Dofasco\u2019s capability to support the most demanding product segments including automotive exposed, advanced high strength steels, and consumer packing.  This new production route for ArcelorMittal Dofasco will provide a technically advanced manufacturing environment for operations, maintenance, and technology staff to work in, with improved health and safety. New positions, training, and development will be provided for employees moving from existing business units to new assets, with approximately 160,000 training hours required to transition our workforce to the new footprint.  Announcing the investment, Vic Fedeli, Minster of Economic Development Job Creation and Trade said:  \u201cFrom day one, our government\u2019s plan has been to unleash Ontario\u2019s economic potential by reducing the cost of doing business in Ontario by nearly $7 billion a year. This once-in-a-generation investment to transform the province into a world-leading producer of green steel is a major step forward as we strive for a full economic recovery and transform our auto supply chains to build the car of the future \u2013 right here in Ontario.\u201d  Speaking at the announcement in Hamilton, John Brett, ArcelorMittal North America CEO, said:  \u201cReducing our CO2 emissions intensity worldwide by 25% by 2030 is an ambitious target for a steel and mining company; but we believe it is achievable and that it is our responsibility to invent or innovate the processes and technologies that will enable us to reach that goal. As part of that, we understand that in the coming years, the assets used to make steel will undergo a transformation on a scale not seen for many decades.\u201d  Highlighting the impact of the announcement, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard said:  \u201cThis is the most significant construction project ever undertaken at Dofasco. And the most important achievement in the project timeline will be that everyone working on site is working safely and returning home to their family unharmed.  \u201cAll options for the newest, most advanced technology that achieves maximum carbon reduction for steelmaking, enhanced product capability and quality, and advanced manufacturing employment opportunities were explored. Extensive benchmarking and modelling were also completed in preparing the ultimate plan for the sustainability of the environment, the company, employees, customers, and the community.\u201d  In addition to Canada, the Company has also announced investments in decarbonisation technologies in Belgium, France and Spain. Combined investment for the four projects totals US$5.6 billion, with anticipated carbon emissions reduction totalling 19.5 million tonnes, which is equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 4,240,858 cars being driven for a year[1].

Replacing the natural gas with green hydrogen in the DRI plants \u2013 once green hydrogen is available at scale, and at a competitive price - will bring our CO2 emissions down by 90%. And the remaining CO2 emissions will be captured and either stored or used.  \u201cWe have a detailed plan to do this and are ready to roll out this plan; we have the investment support of the Belgian, French, German and Spanish governments, and are preparing as much as possible, while we await funding approval from the European Commission \u2013 we submitted applications for funding, on time, last summer but are still waiting for a decision.\u201d  Speaking in his EUROFER capacity, he added that across Europe more than 60 industrial scale projects are about to be launched by steelmakers - potentially reducing the European steel industry\u2019s CO2 emissions by 81.5 million tonnes by 2030: \u201cThat matches the annual CO2 emissions per capita of around 13 million Europeans \u2013 or more than the populations of Belgium and Luxembourg combined. No other energy-intensive industry has set out such ambition.\u201d  \u2018Votes will decide the future of steel in Europe\u2019   Ahead of votes on the ETS revisions in the environment committee of the European Parliament next week, and a plenary vote in early June, Mr Van Poelvoorde said: \u201cThe situation is very serious, and urgent. With the revised ETS that\u2019s on the table today, even after the whole European steel sector has cut CO2 emissions by 30% and invested \u20ac31bn in capex and \u20ac55bn in opex, the European steel sector will be paying \u20ac8.4bn a year in CO2 costs in 2030 - at a time when we will still be investing heavily in the transition phase from blast furnace-based steelmaking to DRI-EAF steelmaking.\u201d  Linked to the ETS, he also spoke about the proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism: \u201cWe welcome this idea, and indeed we need assurance that imports will be subject to the same CO2 cost as European producers. As it is currently proposed however, the carbon border adjustment will not do this. Instead it will create a situation where European steel will be uncompetitive in the global market. We will simply not have a market for our high cost, low-emissions steel, without a level playing field.\u201d  The industry needs a transition period  Addressing critics of the steel industry who argue that the proposed ETS reforms are needed to accelerate decarbonisation, he explained that the industry needs a transition phase to allow time to transform steelmaking sites: \u201cReplacing blast furnaces with DRI-EAF plants takes years \u2013 after the engineering phase, we need two years for the building phase, followed by a period of testing and commissioning. For each of our planned DRI-EAF projects, we will transform an existing industrial site through brownfield investment. We therefore need a transition phase. This will allow us to continue producing via the blast furnace route \u2013 making steel in Europe and generating funds that we can reinvest building the new plants that we need for carbon-neutral steelmaking.\u201d  Crucial need for renewable energy at scale  Access to affordable renewable energy at scale is one of the crucial pillars of carbon-neutral steelmaking \u2013 and Mr Van Poelvoorde explained why: \u201cBy 2030 the European steel industry will need 150 TWh of renewable electricity from the grid, of which half will be needed for the production of hydrogen. This is double the total electricity consumption of Belgium in 2020. Europe must accelerate the creation of a regulatory environment for green hydrogen (storage, transport); push the building of infrastructure and accelerate the permitting.\u201d  The importance of a secure supply chain   He also reminded the audience of the importance of a secure supply chain. \u201cJust last month, Ursula Von Der Leyen said: \u2018Every euro we invest in renewables and energy efficiency is a down-payment on our future energy independence\u2019 \u2013 and the same could be said of Europe\u2019s steel industry. Every euro invested in carbon-neutral steelmaking in Europe, is a down-payment on a healthy supply chain for Europe\u2019s long-term prosperity. Steel is strategic, it\u2019s part of the critical value chain \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt that these value chains will be significantly weakened, if steelmaking moves outside Europe.\u201d  To find out more about ArcelorMittal\u2019s decarbonisation strategy, visit https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/climate-action","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-europe-ceo-calls-on-the-european-parliament-to-help-save-european-steelmakers-decarbonisation-projects-threatened-by-uncertainty\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

The two companies have signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation on sustainability, specifically in the production of low-carbon emissions steel parts and are working closely to ensure that ArcelorMittal\u2019s steel meets all Gestamp\u2019s technical requirements. In this process, Gestamp has a very important role in validating the low-carbon emissions steel produced by ArcelorMittal in order to meet the standards of excellence its automotive clients need. This challenge is the responsibility of Gestamp\u2019s R&D team that, due to the Company\u00b4s know-how, has developed a detailed, step-by-step procedure to validate and homologate ArcelorMittal\u2019s low-carbon emissions steel for use in vehicle production.  Using Usibor\u00ae 1500 made with XCarb\u00ae recycled and renewably produced substrate, Gestamp has successfully trialed the first parts (such as a car\u2019s tunnel, and seat reinforcements) in press-hardenable steel, which is ultra high-strength and therefore enables car manufacturers to achieve excellent weight reductions across the vehicle. XCarb\u00ae recycled and renewably produced is a decarbonized product made with a very high proportion of recycled steel in an EAF and 100% renewable electricity. The steel used by Gestamp has a carbon footprint that is almost 70% lower than the same product made without XCarb\u00ae recycled and renewably produced. These are major steps forward in Gestamp\u2019s ESG strategy to decarbonize their supply chain and contribute to the mitigation of climate change, collaborating to make this low-carbon emissions steel project a tangible reality and therefore, more sustainable vehicles.   Speaking about the partnership between ArcelorMittal and Gestamp, Francisco J. Riberas Executive Chairman Gestamp, said: \u201cAt Gestamp we always work aligned with the needs of our customers in order to meet their objectives of sustainability. And it is most important for the mobility of the future that we help them to decarbonize their supply chain. True to our own ESG strategy, the R&D teams at Gestamp have verified empirically that these steels meet the customer's specifications for these parts. Based on these tests carried out, the Company has defined an approval process that guarantees our customers that our validation of this steel is carried out in compliance with all the validation requirements that they request.\u201d  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe said: \u201cDecarbonising our world is the biggest challenge we have ever faced as a society, and as an industry. The scale of the challenge for steelmakers means that partnerships and collaboration are crucial for us to have a chance of succeeding \u2013 we achieve more, faster, by working with our customers and other stakeholders. Our work with our valued customer Gestamp to use our XCarb\u00ae recycled and renewably produced to manufacture ultra-high strength steel to help carmakers decarbonise their supply chain is a beacon for our industry; just a few years ago, we did not think it would be technically possible to do this, but today we are on the brink of supplying low-carbon emissions steel for large-scale automotive production\u201d.

Most growth in energy demand will occur in developing nations that are not part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Per capita income in those countries is likely to increase by 135 percent.\nNatural gas is expected to meet about 40 percent of the growth in global energy needs and demand for the fuel will increase by 50 percent. Nuclear and renewable energy sources \u2013 including bio-energy, hydro, geothermal, wind, and solar \u2013 are also likely to account for nearly 40 percent of the growth in global energy demand by 2040. By then, they are expected to make up nearly 25 percent of supplies of which nuclear alone represents about one third.\n\u201cExxonMobil\u2019s analysis and those of independent agencies confirms our long-standing view that all viable energy sources will be needed to meet increasing demand,\u201d said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation. \u201cThe Outlook for Energy is a useful resource to help understand future energy supply and demand, which can aid decisions by individuals, businesses and governments that together will affect the future of energy.\u201d\nThe Outlook projects that global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will peak around 2030 and then start to decline. Emissions in OECD nations are projected to fall by about 20 percent from 2014 to 2040.\nThe Outlook for Energy is ExxonMobil\u2019s long-range forecast developed by its economists, engineers and scientists through data-driven analysis. It examines energy supply and demand trends for approximately 100 countries, 15 demand sectors and 20 different energy types.\n\u201cOur forecast is used as a foundation for the company\u2019s business strategies and to help guide multi-billion dollar investment decisions,\u201d said William Colton, vice president of ExxonMobil Corporate Strategic Planning, which develops The Outlook for Energy. \u201cFor many years the Outlook has taken into account policies established to reduce energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. The climate accord reached at the recent COP 21 conference in Paris set many new goals, and while many related policies are still emerging, the outlook continues to anticipate that such policies will increase the cost of carbon dioxide emissions over time.\u201d\nKey findings of the report include:\n  * In 2040, oil and natural gas are expected to make up nearly 60 percent of global supplies, while nuclear and renewables will be approaching 25 percent. Oil will provide one third of the world\u2019s energy in 2040, remaining the No. 1 source of fuel, and natural gas will move into second place.\n  * North America, which for decades had been an oil importer, is on pace to become a net exporter around 2020.\n  * India will surpass China as the world\u2019s most populous nation, with 1.6 billion people. The two countries are expected to account for almost half of the growth in global energy demand.\n  * Global demand for electricity is expected to increase by 65 percent, and 85 percent of the increase is in non-OECD nations.\n  * The share of the world\u2019s electricity generated by coal is expected to fall to about 30 percent in 2040 from approximately 40 percent in 2014.\n  * Global energy demand from transportation is projected to rise by about 30 percent, and practically all the growth will be in non-OECD countries.\n  * Sales of new hybrids are expected to jump from about 2 percent of new-car sales in 2014 to more than 40 percent by 2040, when one in four cars in the world will be a hybrid. Average fuel economy will rise from 25 to about 45 miles per gallon.\n  * Already the world\u2019s largest oil-importing region, Asia Pacific\u2019s net imports are projected to rise by more than 50 percent by 2040 as domestic production remains steady and demand increases.\nFor more information about The Outlook for Energy, visit www.exxonmobil.com\/energyoutlook.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2016\/0125_ExxonMobils-energy-outlook-projects-energy-demand-increase-and-decline-in-carbon-intensity","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

We sought the industry leaders in carbonate fuel-cell technology to test its application in pilot stages to help confirm what our researchers saw in the lab over the last two years.\u201d  \nChip Bottone, president and chief executive officer of FuelCell Energy, Inc., said his company is pleased to bring its global leadership in the development of carbonate fuel cells to this project.\n\u201cCarbon capture with carbonate fuel cells is a potential game-changer for affordably and efficiently concentrating carbon dioxide for large-scale gas and coal-fired power plants,\u201d Bottone said. \u201cUltra-clean and efficient power generation is a key attribute of fuel cells and the carbon capture configuration has the added benefit of eliminating approximately 70 percent of the smog-producing nitrogen oxide generated by the combustion process of these large-scale power plants.\u201d\nTwo years of comprehensive laboratory tests have demonstrated that the unique integration of two existing technologies \u2013 carbonate fuel cells and natural gas-fired power generation \u2013 captures carbon dioxide more efficiently than existing scrubber conventional capture technology. The potential breakthrough comes from an increase in electrical output using the fuel cells, which generate power, compared to a nearly equivalent decrease in electricity using conventional technology.\nThe resulting net benefit has the potential to substantially reduce costs associated with carbon capture for natural gas-fired power generation, compared to the expected costs associated with conventional separation technology. A key component of the research will be to validate initial projected savings of up to one-third.\nThe scope of the agreement between ExxonMobil and FuelCell Energy will initially focus for about one to two years on how to further increase efficiency in separating and concentrating carbon dioxide from the exhaust of natural gas-fueled power turbines. Depending on reaching several milestones, the second phase will more comprehensively test the technology for another one to two years in a small-scale pilot project prior to integration at a larger-scale pilot facility.\nExxonMobil is a leader in carbon capture and sequestration and has extensive experience in all of the component technologies of carbon capture and storage, including participation in several carbon dioxide injection projects over the last three decades. In 2015, ExxonMobil captured 6.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide for sequestration \u2013 the equivalent of eliminating the annual greenhouse gas emissions of more than 1 million passenger vehicles.\n\u201cWe are continually researching technologies that have an ability to reduce carbon dioxide emissions,\u201d Swarup said. \u201cMost solutions that can make an impact of the scale that is required are not found overnight. Our research with FuelCell Energy will be conducted methodically to ensure that all paths toward viability are explored.\u201d\nUsing fuel cells to capture carbon dioxide from power plants results in reduced emissions and increased power generation. In the carbon capture context, power plant exhaust is directed to the fuel cell, replacing air that is normally used in combination with natural gas during the fuel cell power generation process.

Barry Electric Generating Station to host multi-megawatt fuel cell system\n  * Carbon capture to be demonstrated from natural gas and coal power generation under FuelCell Energy agreements with ExxonMobil and the U.S. Dept. of Energy\n  * Pilot results to inform development of standalone facility for larger scale testing\nThe James M. Barry Electric Generating Station, a 2.7 gigawatt mixed-use coal and gas-fired power plant operated by Southern Company (NYSE: SO) subsidiary Alabama Power, will host pilot plant tests of the technology, which uses carbonate fuel cells to concentrate and capture carbon dioxide streams from power plants. The tests will demonstrate carbon capture from natural gas-fired power generation under an agreement between FuelCell Energy and ExxonMobil announced in May, and from coal-fired power generation under a previously announced agreement between FuelCell Energy and the U.S. Dept. of Energy.  \nThis fuel cell carbon capture solution could substantially reduce costs and lead to a more economical pathway toward large-scale carbon capture and sequestration globally.\n\u201cThe fuel cell carbon capture solution we are advancing with ExxonMobil could be a game-changer in affordably reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants globally,\u201d said Chip Bottone, president and chief executive officer of FuelCell Energy, Inc. \u201cThe carbonate fuel cell solution uses a proven global platform to generate power while capturing carbon dioxide.\u201d\nVijay Swarup, vice president for research and development at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company, said ExxonMobil scientists recognized an opportunity to pursue the novel approach to use carbonate fuel cells at natural gas power plants. Current carbon capture processes consume energy, which increases costs. But carbonate fuel cells generate electricity and hydrogen while capturing and concentrating carbon dioxide streams, which will reduce the cost of carbon capture.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s growing need for electricity makes it critical to continue finding affordable, scalable ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants to mitigate the risk of climate change,\u201d said Swarup. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the potential of this novel approach as we continue to work on the scientific fundamentals in the lab and look to prove their viability in the field.\u201d\nThe pilot plant tests will use FuelCell Energy\u2019s commercial DFC3000\u00ae carbonate fuel cell power system to concentrate and capture a portion of the carbon dioxide emissions from the power plant as part of the fuel cells\u2019 power generation process. Flue gas from power generation will be directed into the fuel cells\u2019 air intake system where it is combined with natural gas. The fuel cells concentrate and capture carbon dioxide and also eliminate about 70 percent of smog-producing nitrogen oxide from coal, supporting federal and local clean air initiatives. Following capture, carbon dioxide will be compressed and cooled utilizing standard chilling equipment. Installation of the fuel cell plant will begin after completion of engineering studies that are already under way.\nResults from the natural gas pilot test will help guide engineering studies for potential construction of a standalone pilot plant to test the technology at a larger scale, under FuelCell Energy\u2019s existing agreement with ExxonMobil.\nThe Barry generating station is located near Mobile in Bucks, Alabama, and has 2,657 megawatt total generating capacity from six units fueled by coal and natural gas. Southern Company and Alabama Power have previously conducted carbon capture research at the location and at another power plant in Wilsonville, Alabama, near Birmingham.\nExxonMobil is a global leader in carbon capture and sequestration, and captured approximately 6.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2015 for sequestration, the equivalent of eliminating the annual greenhouse gas emissions of more than 1 million passenger vehicles. Since 2000, ExxonMobil has spent nearly $7 billion on technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including on energy efficiency, cogeneration, flare reduction, carbon capture and sequestration, and research on lower-emission energy solutions.\nAccording to 2015 data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, two-thirds of the 4 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity generated in the United States originated from coal and natural gas.\nAbout FuelCell Energy\nDirect FuelCell\u00ae power plants are generating ultra-clean, efficient and reliable power on three continents, affordably providing continuous distributed power generation to a variety of industries including utilities, commercial and municipal customers. The Company\u2019s power plants have generated billions of kilowatt hours of ultra-clean power using a wide variety of fuels including renewable biogas from wastewater treatment and food processing, as well as clean natural gas.

The forum\u2019s scenarios are publicly available and are used for analytical purposes, including by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nThe global scenarios assessed by ExxonMobil, which include a full range of energy technologies, contemplate limiting global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to have a likely chance of holding atmospheric concentrations to the equivalent of 450 parts per million CO2 in 2100; these scenarios are generally considered to be consistent with pathways that would limit global average temperature rise in 2100 to 2oC above pre-industrial levels.\nThe company\u2019s analysis of these 2oC scenarios examined the mean of the annual average demand growth rates of the various model outputs between 2010 and 2040 for multiple sources of energy. This analysis of these 2oC scenarios indicates: total energy demand increases about 0.5 percent per year; oil demand decreases about 0.4 percent per year; natural gas demand increases about 0.9 percent per year; coal demand decreases about 2.4 percent per year; and renewables demand increases about 4.5 percent per year.\nAll energy sources remain important across the assessed 2oC scenarios to 2040. As a result of ongoing demand coupled with natural hydrocarbon field decline, trillions of dollars of additional investment in oil and gas production will be required, including to meet a 2oC pathway. Based on the average growth rates of assessed 2oC scenarios, natural gas demand is estimated to increase to 445 billion cubic feet per day by 2040; oil demand is estimated to decline to 78 million barrels per day by 2040.\n\u201cOur job is to supply the energy the world needs in an environmentally responsible way,\u201d said Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). \u201cIt\u2019s a dual challenge \u2013 we need to meet society\u2019s growing need for energy while addressing the risks of climate change. We are committed to being part of the solution by investing in new technologies that can provide economic solutions on a globally scalable basis. \u201d\nMany experts agree that advancements will be needed to reach and maintain a 2oC pathway through 2100. ExxonMobil has invested billions of dollars in research and development, including multiple university and business partnerships around the globe, aimed at achieving the technical breakthroughs required.\n\u201cSince 2000, our investments to develop lower-emission energy solutions have totaled about $8 billion,\u201d Woods said. \u201cWe are deploying technologies such as cogeneration and carbon capture and storage, while researching next-generation solutions such as algae biofuels and advanced carbon capture using fuel cells. Continued research will be critical.\u201d\nWith growing global populations and economies, key levers to address the risks of climate change include further energy efficiency improvements and reducing the GHG intensity of the world\u2019s energy system. \u201cFor our part, we continue to take action to mitigate our emissions and help consumers lessen their GHG impact,\u201d Woods said.\nExxonMobil\u2019s Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040 describes a rapidly growing global population and rise in living standards in developing countries that will drive a growth in worldwide energy demand of about 25 percent from 2016 to 2040. At the same time, energy efficiency gains and gradual reductions in the GHG intensity of the energy system, will help to moderate energy use and reduce by nearly 45 percent the carbon intensity of the global economy, according to the report.\nEmerging economies in countries that are not part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will account for essentially all energy demand growth, led by an expanding Asia-Pacific region.\nAs prosperity rises, electrification continues as a significant global trend. Energy demand for power generation accounts for about 50 percent of global demand growth, with much of that coming from non-OECD countries.\n\u201cNatural gas use is likely to increase more than any other energy source, around 40 percent, with about half its growth for electricity generation,\u201d said T.J. Wojnar, vice president for Corporate Strategic Planning. \u201cThe abundance and versatility of natural gas, in addition to its significant air quality benefits, make it a valuable energy source to meet a wide variety of needs, while also helping the world to shift to a less carbon-intensive source of energy.\u201d\nAmong the most rapidly expanding energy supplies will be electricity from solar and wind, together growing about 400 percent.\nWhile energy demand will grow, global carbon dioxide emissions are likely to peak by 2040, at about 10 percent above 2016 levels, as energy sources shift toward lower-emission fuels such as natural gas, renewables, and nuclear.\nThe Outlook predicts a rise in electric vehicles as well as efficiency improvements in conventional engines. This will likely lead to a peak in liquid fuels use by the world\u2019s light-duty vehicle fleet by 2030. However, oil will continue to play a leading role in the world\u2019s energy mix.\n\u201cOur in-depth analysis shows that even if every light-duty vehicle in the world was fully electric by 2040, the demand for liquids could still be similar to levels seen in 2013,\u201d said Wojnar. \u201cThis is because of growing demand from commercial transportation and the chemical sector.\u201d\nThe Outlook for Energy is ExxonMobil\u2019s long-range forecast developed through data-driven analysis, reflecting broad knowledge of energy markets and the expertise of economists, engineers, and scientists. It examines energy supply and demand trends for approximately 100 regional\/country areas, 15 demand sectors and 20 different energy types. ExxonMobil uses the forecast as a foundation for its business strategies and to help guide multi-billion dollar investment decisions.\nKey findings from this year\u2019s Outlook:\n  * In 2040, oil and natural gas continue to supply about 55 percent of the world\u2019s energy needs; oil continues to provide the largest share of the energy mix with demand rising about 20 percent driven by commercial transportation and chemicals.\n  * Nuclear and renewable energy sources are likely to account for nearly 40 percent of the growth in global energy demand to 2040.\n  * The share of the world\u2019s electricity generated by coal is expected to fall to less than 30 percent in 2040 from approximately 40 percent in 2016.\n  * Increasing electrification of light-duty vehicles is anticipated to grow strongly. In total, full hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric-only vehicles will be approaching 40 percent of global light-duty vehicle sales in 2040, compared to about 3 percent in 2016.\nFor more information on the Energy & Carbon Summary and Outlook for Energy, visit www.exxonmobil.com\/energyoutlook.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2018\/0202_ExxonMobil-releases-Energy-and-Carbon-Summary-and-Outlook-for-Energy","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

The company will continue to focus on investments that take advantage of its technology leadership, integrated businesses and highly skilled employees.\n\u201cThrough record discoveries, world-class acquisitions and growing access to attractive markets, we\u2019ve put together the best portfolio of new investments since the Exxon-Mobil merger nearly 20 years ago,\u201d Woods said. \u201cOur investments are robust to a wide range of price environments, and they leverage our competitive advantages in technology, integration and, most importantly, our people.\u201d\nLower-cost-of-supply investments in U.S. tight oil, deepwater and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are key drivers behind ExxonMobil\u2019s plans, and are supported by a suite of industry-leading technologies including advanced seismology, integrated reservoir modeling and data analytics.\nThe company has announced it would increase tight oil production in the U.S. Permian Basin five-fold, and start up 25 projects worldwide, which will add volumes of more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. In 2017, ExxonMobil added 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its resource base in locations including the Permian, Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Brazil.\nExxonMobil is upgrading its product slate through strategic investments at refineries in Baytown and Beaumont in Texas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Rotterdam, Antwerp, Singapore, and Fawley in the U.K. The company expects to grow its chemical manufacturing capacity in North America and Asia Pacific by about 40 percent, in part by adding 13 new facilities including two world-class steam crackers in the United States.\nWoods said the company is focused on four fundamentals: integration, technology, operational excellence and project execution.\n\u201cOur investment plans, like every aspect of our business, are built on the fundamentals,\u201d Woods said. \u201cWe focus on success factors that are true regardless of market conditions, and we leverage areas where we have unique competitive strengths.\u201d\nWoods also stressed the company\u2019s commitment to a solutions-oriented approach to address the dual challenge of producing energy the world needs for economic growth while addressing the risks of climate change.\n\u201cSociety\u2019s needs evolve and so do we,\u201d Woods said. \u201cWe have a long history of consistently rising to and meeting the challenges of a dynamic world.\u201d\nWoods provided details of ExxonMobil\u2019s response to a resolution passed during the 2017 shareholders meeting seeking more information on how the company will address the risks of climate change.\nEarlier this year, the company released its updated Energy & Carbon Summary report, which examined a range of 2 degrees Celsius scenarios developed by experts at a Stanford University forum. Oil and natural gas continue to play a significant role in meeting the world\u2019s energy needs in each scenario and remain important sources, even in models with the lowest level of total energy demand. The analysis also confirmed that more advances in technology will be required.\nWoods highlighted the company\u2019s strengths in innovation and broad research program, and outlined progress ExxonMobil continues to make in researching and developing lower-carbon solutions, particularly in carbon capture and storage technology, next-generation biofuels, and more efficient manufacturing processes.\nThe company is working with Connecticut-based FuelCell Energy, Inc. on a novel approach to capture carbon from natural gas power plants through fuel cell technology, advanced algae biofuels with partner Synthetic Genomics in California, and a more efficient chemical manufacturing technology with the Georgia Institute of Technology that could dramatically minimize process emissions, among numerous other projects and partnerships.\nExxonMobil recently announced initiatives to cut greenhouse gas emissions associated with its operations, specifically a targeted 15 percent reduction in methane emissions associated with production assets and a 25 percent reduction in flaring. Since 2000, ExxonMobil has spent more than $9 billion to develop and deploy higher-efficiency and lower-emission energy solutions across its operations.\nDuring the annual meeting, shareholders re-elected ExxonMobil\u2019s board of directors, supported the company\u2019s executive compensation program, ratified PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent auditors and voted against four proposals by shareholders. The proxy voting results will be made available on the company\u2019s website.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2018\/0530_ExxonMobil-CEO-Darren-Woods-highlights-growth-plans-and-advances-in-lower-carbon-solutions","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

Using less energy to capture and remove carbon, the material has the potential to reduce the cost of the technology and eventually support commercial applications.\nBy manipulating the structure of the metal organic framework material, the team of scientists and students demonstrated the ability to condense a surface area the size of a football field, into just one gram of mass \u2013 about the same as a paperclip \u2013 that acts as a sponge for CO2. Results of the research were published today in the international peer-reviewed journal, Science.\n\u201cThis innovative hybrid porous material has so far proven to be more effective, requires less heating and cooling, and captures more CO2 than current materials,\u201d said Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company.\n\u201cThrough collaborations with strong academic institutions and national labs like UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, we are developing a portfolio of lower-emissions energy solutions.

ExxonMobil plans to invest $3 billion on lower emission energy solutions through 2025. The business will be led by Joe Blommaert, who has more than 30 years of experience in the industry with leadership roles in technology advancement, product marketing, and operations. The board of directors has elected him as a vice president of Exxon Mobil Corporation.  \n  \nCCS is the process of capturing CO2 that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere from industrial activity, and injecting it into deep geologic formations for safe, secure and permanent storage. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency agree that CCS is one of the most important low-carbon technologies required to achieve societal climate goals at the lowest cost. CCS is also one of the only technologies that could enable some industry sectors to decarbonize, including the refining, chemicals, cement and steel sectors.  \n  \nExxonMobil has more than 30 years of experience in CCS technology and was the first company to capture more than 120 million tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to the emissions of more than 25 million cars for one year. The company has an equity share in about one-fifth of global CO2 capture capacity and has captured approximately 40 percent of all the captured anthropogenic CO2 in the world.  \n  \nExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions will also leverage ExxonMobil\u2019s significant experience in the production of hydrogen which, when coupled with CCS, is likely to play a critical role in a lower-carbon energy system.

We have the expertise that can help bring technologies to market and make a meaningful difference.\u201d  \n  \nThe business will seek to develop partnerships and collaborations on a wide range of technologies, and be responsible for marketing of emission-reduction credits created through the business\u2019s sequestration projects.   \n  \nNew CCS projects and partnerships under evaluation include:\n  * U.S. Gulf Coast \u2013 ExxonMobil is assessing multiple CCS projects along the U.S. Gulf Coast that have the potential to collect millions of tonnes of CO2 from industrial sources for storage in onshore and offshore geologic formations. Included in these projects is a CCS hub concept in Southeast Texas. \n  * Wyoming, USA \u2013 ExxonMobil has progressed permitting for the expansion of its La Barge CCS facilities, which could enable an additional one million tonnes of CO2 per year to be captured. Existing facilities currently capture approximately 7 million tonnes per year, which is the largest amount of CO2 captured by any industrial facility in the world. \n  * Netherlands \u2013 ExxonMobil has executed a joint development agreement to advance its interest in the Port of Rotterdam CO2 Transportation Hub and Offshore Storage project, known as Porthos. The Porthos project aims to collect CO2 emissions from industrial sources and transport them by pipeline to depleted North Sea offshore gas fields. Porthos and its potential customers have applied for EU and national support mechanisms. ExxonMobil also participates in the H-Vision study into large-scale production of low-carbon hydrogen in Rotterdam.\n  * Belgium \u2013 ExxonMobil is participating in the multi-stakeholder CCS project at the Port of Antwerp, Europe\u2019s largest integrated energy and chemicals cluster. The project, which would collect CO2 emissions from industrial sources for storage, recently applied for support from the European Union.\n  * Scotland \u2013 Through its joint venture in the SEGAL system in Northeast Scotland, ExxonMobil is progressing discussions to support the Acorn project, which will collect CO2 from the St. Fergus gas processing complex for transport and storage in offshore gas reservoirs. \n  * Singapore \u2013 ExxonMobil is planning a CCS hub concept to capture, transport and permanently store CO2 generated by industrial activity in the Asia-Pacific region. The project concept is based on a plan to capture CO2 emissions from Singapore manufacturing facilities for storage in the region.\n  * Qatar \\- ExxonMobil is a partner in several existing joint ventures with Qatar Petroleum that operate a CCS project with an annual capacity of 2.1 million tonnes at Ras Laffan. ExxonMobil is evaluating opportunities to add additional capture capacity in the region.\nThe new projects will complement ExxonMobil\u2019s current carbon capture capacity in the United States, Australia and Qatar, which totals about 9 million tonnes per year, the equivalent of planting 150 million trees every year.  \n  \nExxonMobil is collaborating with multiple partners across industry, academia and government to advance carbon capture technologies to reduce costs and enhance scalability. This includes the company\u2019s work with FuelCell Energy to advance carbonate fuel cell technology to more efficiently capture CO2 from industrial facilities, and Global Thermostat, a collaboration to advance efforts to capture CO2 directly from the air.   \n  \nCCS opportunities can become more commercially attractive through government policy, including the United States tax credit 45Q, which ExxonMobil supports, and other supportive policies in the European Union, Canada and Singapore.  \n  \nSince 2000, ExxonMobil has spent more than $10 billion to develop and deploy higher-efficiency and lower-emission energy solutions across its operations. The company works with about 80 universities in the United States, Europe and Asia to explore next-generation energy technologies.   \n  \n    \n  \n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2021\/0201_ExxonMobil-Low-Carbon-Solutions-to-commercialize-emission-reduction-technology","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

I was proud to share the results of your hard work and our plans for the future. I thought I\u2019d provide an overview of the presentation that the management committee made.\nA lot has happened since last year\u2019s Investor Day, which took place as the devastating impact of COVID-19 was just emerging. In the year that\u2019s followed, we faced historic lows in our businesses and a challenging economic environment. We dealt with personal impacts involving families and friends. And, we made some difficult, but necessary, changes to improve the competitiveness of our company. \nDespite these challenges, we: \n  * Achieved our best ever safety and reliability performance;\n  * Maintained an uninterrupted supply of essential energy and products; \n  * Advanced an industry-leading portfolio of advantaged investment opportunities; \n  * Delivered critical efficiencies to significantly lower costs; \n  * Achieved our 2020 emission reduction goals and developed aggressive plans for additional reductions by 2025.\nIn short, we\u2019ve emerged one year later a stronger company - positioned for future success.\nGoing forward, our plans leverage our core competitive advantages to deliver sustained value while helping the world transition to a lower-carbon future. Upgrading our asset portfolio while progressing industry-leading investments will grow earnings and cash flow to sustain and grow the dividend, pay down debt and fund future projects. Our current portfolio of major project investments through 2025 generates returns of greater than 30 percent.\nOf course, fundamental to our success, will be delivering industry leading safety and environmental performance, while continuing our drive for efficiencies and lower costs. To this end, we\u2019ve already achieved $3 billion in structural reductions. Our current plans deliver an additional $3 billion in annual savings by year-end 2023. As we go forward, we will stay focused on how we can deliver further improvements by leveraging the corporation\u2019s scale and integration.\nTurning to the environment, we\u2019ve made significant progress in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and have solid plans for reducing them further. In addition, we have a robust development portfolio of technologies and products that will help us and our customers achieve additional reductions.\nAs we\u2019ve advanced research into more cost-effective technology for carbon capture, the carbon capture and storage (CCS) venture we established in 2018 has made good progress in developing a number of potential projects. With this progress and growing government and market interest, we launched the ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business. Leveraging our project expertise, operating experience, facilities footprint and longstanding leadership in CCS, we believe this new business will help accelerate broad-scale deployment of value accretive CCS investments. It could also advance investments in hydrogen as the technology to lower production cost matures.\nCapitalizing on these emerging technologies and market opportunities could significantly reduce CO2 emissions and help society achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement \u2013 which we\u2019ve supported since its inception. It can also help us grow shareholder value.\nAs we work toward a lower-carbon future, we will continue to responsibly meet today\u2019s demand for the energy and products needed to support modern life.\nIn the Upstream, we have a world class portfolio of attractive investments with flexibility to adjust spend as market conditions evolve. Roughly 90 percent of our investments to develop resources generate a 10 percent return at $35 per barrel or less. We\u2019re making outstanding progress in Guyana and the Permian, and see great potential in Brazil. In the Downstream, we are improving net cash margin primarily through conversion projects at advantaged sites and in Chemical, growing high-value performance products by 60 percent.

Analysis indicates the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a liquid fuel. The fuel will be tested in race conditions with Porsche\u2019s high-performance motorsports engines during the 2021 Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup race series.   \n  \nPorsche and ExxonMobil\u2019s collaboration will also focus on eFuels, which are synthetic fuels made from hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide. As early as 2022, the companies plan to test the second iteration of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel, which will contain eFuel components. The eFuel is anticipated to achieve a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of up to 85 percent, when blended to current market fuel standards for today\u2019s passenger vehicles.i  \n  \n\u201cThe electrification of our vehicles is of highest priority to us,\u201d said Michael Steiner, Member of the Executive Board, Research and Development of Porsche. \u201ceFuels are a good complement to our powertrain strategy. They allow our customers to drive cars with conventional combustion engines as well as plug-in hybrids with significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions. The collaboration with ExxonMobil enables us to test the eFuels under demanding conditions on the racing track. This is a further step towards making eFuels an affordable and lower greenhouse gas emission substitute to conventional fuels.\u201d  \n  \nThe eFuel will be sourced from the Haru Oni pilot plant based in Chile that generates hydrogen, which is then combined with captured carbon dioxide drawn from the atmosphere to produce methanol. ExxonMobil is providing a license and support for the proprietary technology to convert the methanol to gasoline, which will result in a lower-carbon fuel.   \n  \nIn the pilot phase, around 35,000 gallons of eFuels will be produced in 2022. As the fuel\u2019s primary user, Porsche will use the eFuels from Chile among others in the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup starting in the season of 2022.  \n  \n\u201cOver the past quarter century, we have worked together with Porsche to develop high-performance products that support Porsche\u2019s vehicle performance on the racetrack and on the road,\u201d said Andy Madden, vice president of strategy and planning for ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants. \u201cOur continued collaboration on renewable and eFuels is a critical step in assessing the technical capability and commercial viability of fuels that can significantly reduce emissions.\u201d  \n  \nThe first on-track testing of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel is scheduled for March 30, 2021 in Zandvoort, Netherlands, and will continue throughout the 2021 and 2022 Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup race series.   \n  \nThe collaboration with Porsche builds on ExxonMobil\u2019s continuing efforts to develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions, including high-efficiency fuels and lubricants, advanced plastics and other products that can enable cars and trucks to use less fuel. For example, the two companies have collaborated on a line of specially formulated lubricants for the electric vehicles market, Mobil EVTM range.  \n  \nIn January, ExxonMobil announced the creation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, to commercialize its extensive low-carbon technology portfolio and plans to invest $3 billion on lower emission energy solutions through 2025. Last year, ExxonMobil announced plans to distribute renewable diesel within California and potentially other domestic and international markets as soon as 2022.   \n  \nOver the past two decades, ExxonMobil has invested more than $10 billion to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions, resulting in highly efficient operations that have eliminated or avoided approximately 480 million tonnes of CO2 emissions - the equivalent of taking more than 100 million passenger vehicles off the road for a year.ii  \n  \nPorsche is committed to invest $17.9 billion in electromobility and digitalization by 2025. In 2030 the sports car manufacturer will offer more than 80 percent of its vehicles with electric engines.

We are uniquely placed to help society meet its net zero ambitions, while capturing enormous future opportunities and delivering value for shareholders for many decades to come.\u201d\nExxonMobil\u2019s presentation outlines how it is investing in lower-carbon technologies to expand business opportunities over the longer term, while driving structural improvements in existing businesses with a disciplined, value-driven approach.\nThe presentation highlights the new ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business, which is working to commercialize technologies to reduce emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors, such as power generation, commercial transportation and heavy industry. The technologies include carbon capture and storage (CCS), which will be the initial focus of Low Carbon Solutions, as well as hydrogen, and advanced biofuels. Demand for these lower-emission technologies could create multi-trillion dollar markets by 2040. ExxonMobil is the global leader in CCS, and has captured approximately 40 percent of all anthropogenic CO2 ever captured, the equivalent to planting approximately 2 billion trees.\nExxonMobil recently announced a multi-industry CCS concept that has the potential to significantly decarbonize heavy industries located near the Houston ship channel; early projections indicate that, with the appropriate enablers, it could remove approximately 100 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2040. The lower-carbon business opportunities leverage decades of ExxonMobil experience in deploying technology at scale, and competitive advantages demonstrated in its existing businesses. In addition, the company\u2019s 2025 emission-reduction plans are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement and a 2-degree pathway.\nThe company also details how it is investing in one of the most attractive, high-return portfolios in the industry to increase cash flow while maintaining existing production levels needed to responsibly meet society\u2019s continued demand for oil and gas and high-value chemical products. \nExxonMobil\u2019s plans are built to capture opportunities in a wide range of long-term energy-demand scenarios, consistent with those of the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the authoritative International Energy Agency, that show a continued use of fossil fuels well into the future. The company\u2019s current plan assumes flat production volumes while still generating excess cash at $50 per barrel Brent.\nNoting significant improvements to its portfolio since 2017, and the fact that the company continues to benefit from long-cycle actions approved by its board, ExxonMobil highlighted that total shareholder return (TSR) has outperformed the peer average over the past six-month, one-year, two-year and three-year periods, and had a 52 percent TSR over the past year. \nThe company also outperformed the peer average on long-term return on capital employed (ROCE) and dividend growth per share over the last five years.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2021\/0427_ExxonMobil-details-strategy-to-grow-shareholder-value-and-transition-to-lower-carbon-future","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

A current and former member of our government affairs team were secretly recorded making disturbing and inaccurate comments about our positions on a variety of issues, including climate change policy, and our interaction with elected officials.\nTheir comments are entirely inconsistent with our commitment to the environment, transparency and what our employees and management team have worked toward since I became CEO four years ago. I want to make our position clear.\nWe understand the tremendous challenge represented by climate change and have fully supported the Paris Agreement since its inception. Our scientists are working to develop innovative solutions to help reduce emissions, with a focus on the highest emitting and most difficult to decarbonize sectors of the economy: commercial transportation, power generation and heavy industry. \nIt is in these areas where we believe ExxonMobil can best contribute to the challenge of climate change. For example, through our new ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business we are advancing plans for large-scale emission reductions with new carbon capture and storage opportunities around the world. We are also leveraging ExxonMobil\u2019s significant experience in the production of hydrogen which, when coupled with carbon capture and storage, is likely to play a critical role in a lower-carbon energy system. We\u2019re investing $3 billion on lower-emission energy solutions through 2025 on top of $10 billion we\u2019ve spent over the past two decades. As we develop additional value-added opportunities, I expect these investments to grow.\nWe believe a price on carbon emissions is essential to achieving net zero emissions. Carbon pricing would send a clear signal through the market, creating incentives to reduce emissions, fostering investment in R&D to advance solutions and providing consumers with transparency to make the best choices.\nWhile there is some resistance to a carbon tax, we are actively and publicly discussing other options, including lower-carbon fuels and other sector-based approaches that would place a uniform, predictable cost on carbon. Today, through government regulation and incentives, we are paying to reduce carbon throughout the economy. Unfortunately, most of us don\u2019t know what it\u2019s costing. We think it\u2019s vitally important for the cost of reducing carbon to be more transparent to enable comparisons of the various options to help policy makers reduce emissions at the lowest overall cost to society.\nWe are actively working to reduce our own emissions. Overall, we have reduced operated greenhouse gas emissions by 11 percent from 2016 to 2020, and we\u2019ve laid out plans for significant further reductions by 2025. We are also working to find new and better ways to monitor and reduce methane emissions, including collaborations with universities, environmental groups and other industry partners. Through 2020, we reduced methane emissions nearly 34 percent across our U.S. unconventional operations, compared to 2016 when the Paris Agreement was signed.\nWe have great respect for policy makers, elected officials and organizations across the political spectrum who are grappling to effectively address climate change, one of the greatest challenges of our time. ExxonMobil\u2019s position is clear: we want to be part of the solution while responsibly providing affordable energy required to power the economy. We have the experience, capabilities, capacity and commitment to help meet this critical need.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/Statements\/Our-position-on-climate-policy-and-carbon-pricing","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

Calpine, Chevron, Dow, ExxonMobil, INEOS, Linde, LyondellBasell, Marathon Petroleum, NRG Energy, Phillips 66 and Valero have agreed to begin discussing plans that could lead to capturing and safely storing up to 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 and about 100 million metric tons by 2040.\nThe companies plan to help address industrial CO2 emissions in one of the largest concentrated sources in the United States. Collectively, the 11 companies are considering using CCS technology at facilities that generate electricity and manufacture products that society uses every day, such as plastics, motor fuels and packaging.\nIf CCS technology is fully implemented at the Houston-area facilities these 11 companies operate, nearly 75 million metric tons of CO2 could be captured and stored per year by 2040. There are ongoing discussions with other companies that have industrial operations in the area to add even more CO2 capture capacity. They could announce their support at a later date and add further momentum toward the city of Houston\u2019s ambitions to be carbon neutral by 2050.\n\u201cHouston can achieve our net zero goals by working together, and it\u2019s exciting to see so many companies have already come together to talk about making Houston the world leader in carbon capture and storage,\u201d said Sylvester Turner, Mayor of Houston. \u201cWe\u2019re reimagining what it means to be the energy capital of the world, and applying proven technology to reduce emissions is one of the best ways to get started.\u201d\nWide-scale deployment of CCS in the Houston area will require the collective support of industry, communities and government. If appropriate policies and regulations are put in place, CCS could generate tens of thousands of new jobs, protect current jobs and reduce emissions at a lower cost to society than many other widely available technologies. The 11 companies will continue to advocate for policies that enable the long-term commercial viability of new, expanded and existing CCS investments in Texas.\nCCS is the process of capturing CO2 from industrial activity that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and injecting it into deep underground geologic formations for safe, secure and permanent storage. With supportive regulations, CO2 from the Houston industrial area could be safely stored in the U.S. Gulf Coast region in formations thousands of feet below the surface or seabed. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that storage capacity along the U.S. Gulf Coast is enough to hold 500 billion metric tons of CO2 \u2014 more than 130 years of the country\u2019s total industrial and power generation emissions, based on 2018 data.\nAlthough renewables will continue to play an important role in a lower-carbon energy future, CCS is one of the few proven technologies that could enable some industry sectors to decarbonize, such as manufacturing and heavy industry. The International Energy Agency projects CCS could mitigate up to 15 percent of global emissions by 2040, and the U.N.

Today, that means taking a leading role in providing the products that enable modern life, reducing carbon emissions and developing needed technologies to advance a lower-carbon emissions future.\n Benefits of increased investment\nOver the next six years, ExxonMobil plans to invest more than $15 billion on lower greenhouse gas emission initiatives. This significant increase in spending will further accelerate efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our operated facilities. To that point, we are on track to meet our 2025 emission-intensity reduction goals by the end of this year \u2013 four years earlier than anticipated. As a result of our progress, we\u2019re working on even more aggressive reduction plans that are consistent with our support for the goals of the Paris Agreement, the U.S. and European Union\u2019s Global Methane Pledge, as well as the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan announced last week.   \n  \nA significant share of the spending will be directed toward our Low Carbon Solutions business, which is focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry, commercial transportation and power generation, which together account for more than 80% of the world\u2019s energy-related emissions.   \n  \nWe see tremendous opportunities to use our technology and expertise in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels to support meaningful reductions in global emissions. We expect those opportunities to grow as policy support for low-carbon solutions increases.\n Carbon capture and storage\nKey among those technologies is carbon capture and storage, a proven way to collect CO2 emissions and securely store them deep underground. Carbon capture and storage is critical to reaching net zero by 2050, according to independent experts like the International Energy Agency and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  \n  \nExxonMobil is the world leader in carbon capture, and has captured more human-made CO2 than any other company.   \n  \nIn recent months, we\u2019ve announced several carbon capture and storage \u201chub\u201d concepts where high-emission industries can share infrastructure, enabling benefits from economies of scale. Expanded use of carbon capture and storage can further improve the emission reductions associated with hydrogen and biofuels.   \n  \nThe interest we\u2019ve received for the hub concepts has been extremely positive.   \n  \nEleven companies, including ExxonMobil, have expressed interest in supporting a large-scale carbon capture and storage hub in the Houston industrial area. We believe that by 2040, it could be possible to annually capture about 100 million metric tons of CO2 from refineries, chemical plants and power generation facilities in the area. That\u2019s equal to the greenhouse gas emissions today from more than 20 million gasoline-powered passenger vehicles.1  \n  \nIn Wyoming, we\u2019re planning to expand carbon capture and storage capacity at our natural gas and helium production site, which has already captured more CO2 than any other facility in the world.   \n  \nIn Europe, ExxonMobil is working with other companies and governments to advance potential carbon capture and storage hubs in Scotland, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.   \n  \nIn Southeast Asia, we recently outlined our vision for a carbon capture and storage hub to serve heavy industry areas around Singapore. We signed an MOU with Pertamina, the state-owned energy company of Indonesia, to evaluate the potential for deploying low-carbon technologies there, and another with PETRONAS, the state-owned energy company of Malaysia, to collaborate and jointly explore potential carbon capture and storage projects in Malaysia. \n Biofuels and hydrogen\nBiofuels will also play an important role in a lower-carbon future, especially in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from commercial transportation. \nOur Canadian affiliate, Imperial Oil, is progressing plans to produce renewable diesel at its Strathcona refinery in Edmonton using a proprietary catalyst technology that enables advantaged production. Renewable diesel is a drop-in fuel for use in today\u2019s engines that generates 70% fewer carbon emissions than conventional diesel.   \n  \nHere in the U.S., we expanded our agreement with Global Clean Energy to purchase up to 5 million barrels per year of renewable diesel from its biorefinery in Bakersfield, California starting next year.   \n  \nExxonMobil also produces about 1.3 million metric tons of hydrogen annually, and is working to develop new technologies that significantly lower production costs.  \n  \nAnd finally, we continue to advance research with university partners and other stakeholders to explore and commercialize new biofuel technologies.\n Supportive policy\nGovernments\u2019 assistance is critical in developing durable, predictable, and market-driven policies in order to help drive the greatest greenhouse gas emissions reductions at the lowest cost to society. For example, initial policy support for carbon capture and storage could facilitate the development of an effective marketplace that reduces costs and incentivizes additional investment.   \n  \nTo deploy the technology at the pace and scale required to support society\u2019s ambition of a net-zero future, government policies will need to provide direct investment and incentives similar to those available to other lower-carbon technologies. We have long supported an explicit price on carbon to establish market incentives and provide the needed clarity and stability required for investments.   \n  \nNo single technology can enable society to achieve its lower-carbon ambitions. Predictable, stable, cost-effective policies are necessary to incentivize the development and scalability of a wide range of lower-carbon technologies across the economy. \n1 per EPA GHG calculator\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2021\/1109_Why-we-are-investing-15-billion-in-a-lower-carbon-future","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

CCS could also promote long-term economic growth in Southeast Texas and beyond.\nCCS is the process of capturing CO2 from industrial activities that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and injecting it into deep underground geologic formations for secure and permanent storage. CO2 from the Houston industrial area could be stored in nearby on- and offshore storage sites. An analysis of U.S Department of Energy estimates shows the storage capacity along the U.S. Gulf Coast is large enough to store about 500 billion metric tons of CO2, which is equivalent to more than 130 years of industrial and power generation emissions in the United States, based on 2018 data.\nCCS is one of the few proven technologies that could enable some industry sectors that are difficult to decarbonize, such as manufacturing and heavy industry, to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The International Energy Agency projects that CCS could mitigate up to 15% of global emissions by 2040, and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates global decarbonization efforts could be twice as costly without the technology.\nDiscussions continue with other companies that have industrial operations in the Houston region, potentially increasing the projected total CO2 that can be captured and safely stored.\n About the Companies: \nAbout Air Liquide\nA world leader in gases, technologies and services for Industry and Health, Air Liquide is present in 78 countries with approximately 64,500 employees and serves more than 3.8 million customers and patients.

During the three-year research project \u201eCO2MIN\u201c, HeidelbergCement and RWTH Aachen University (RWTH Aachen) will explore the absorption of CO2 from flue gas by the minerals olivine and basalt. In the future, the carbonised minerals could be used as a value-added additive in the production of building materials. HeidelbergCement and RWTH are supported by the Potsdam Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) and the Dutch start-up Green Minerals. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is funding the project, which began on 1 June 2017, with a sum of three million euros.  The natural minerals olivine and basalt are able to bind CO2 over their entire life-cycle. With natural absorption, it takes decades until the minerals are saturated with the greenhouse gas. The research project intends to speed up the absorption process. If successful, carbonised minerals can be used for various product applications.  The use of CO2 as a raw material has high priority in the climate strategy of HeidelbergCement. \"We are already reducing the CO2 emissions of our plants very successfully by using alternative fuels and raw materials and by optimising the efficiency of our kilns,\" explains Jan Theulen, Director of Alternative Resources at HeidelbergCement. \"In order to reduce CO2 emissions even further in the future, we have to develop and test new approaches. One of them is the binding of CO2 by minerals.\"  In the first year the research focuses on the investigation of different minerals in small-scale experiments. The carbonation of the most suitable minerals will be tested under realistic process conditions in the following year. The experiments will be conducted by the institute of Process Metallurgy and Metal Recycling (IME), which also is the coordinator of the RWTH group. Life-cycle assessments (RWTH) as well as analyses of economic aspects and social acceptance (IASS) complete this project phase. In the third year, marketability and acceptance will be further optimised through intensive cooperation with customers.  ###### About HeidelbergCement  HeidelbergCement is one of the world\u2019s largest integrated manufacturers of building materials with leading market positions in aggregates, cement, and ready-mixed concrete.

At the site of the Mergelstetten cement plant in southern Germany, the consortium intends to build and operate its own demonstration plant on a semi-industrial scale, where the so-called oxyfuel process will be applied for CO2 capture. In the future, the captured CO2 will be used to produce so-called \u201creFuels\u201d, which are climate-neutral synthetic fuels such as kerosene for air traffic, with the help of renewable electrical energy.  The cement industry is intensively searching for solutions to return in particular the CO2 emissions, that are unavoidably arising during the burning of limestone, into the production cycle or to use them for new products. To achieve this, the CO2 has to be captured during the cement production process. In order to demonstrate such CO2 capture methods in practice, the four European cement manufacturers Buzzi Unicem SpA - Dyckerhoff GmbH, HeidelbergCement AG, SCHWENK Zement KG, and Vicat S.A. founded the joint venture CI4C \u2013 Cement Innovation for Climate \u2013 already at the end of 2019. Aim of the \"catch4climate\" project is to create the basis for a large-scale application of CO2 capture technologies in cement plants enabling the later use of CO2 as a raw material in other processes (CCU, CCS).  The Oxyfuel process (from Oxy = oxygen and fuel) is a clinker burning process in which pure oxygen is introduced into the cement kiln instead of air. Thanks to the pure oxygen, no nitrogen gets into the burning process which leads to the creation of highly concentrated CO2. The aim is to capture almost 100 percent of the CO2 emissions from a cement plant in a cost-efficient manner. By using this technology, the European cement industry could achieve a significant reduction in process-related CO2 emissions and thus make an important contribution to climate protection. The realisation of the project is still subject to the public research funding to be applied for.  The CI4C consortium has already entered the planning phase and is cooperating closely with the federal state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in the \u201ccatch4climate\u201d pilot project in Mergelstetten.

Both partners will construct and operate a small commercial plant where CO2 will be captured from the kiln exhaust and converted into a cementitious material. The final product will be suitable for use as a new low carbon SCM (Supplementary Cementitious Material) in the production of high-quality concrete with a lower CO2 footprint.  \u201cWe are delighted to add yet another technology to our existing portfolio of carbon capture initiatives, contributing to the circular economy\u201d, says Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. \u201cCarbon capture and utilisation or storage (CCU\/S) is one key lever to significantly reduce otherwise unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions in the cement industry. This is why building new partnerships towards CCU\/S and investing in breakthrough technologies are a core part of HeidelbergCement\u2019s climate strategy.\u201d  The product generated within the new carbon capture process at the Redding plant will be the first cementitious material produced commercially from CO2 captured directly from a cement kiln. Fortera\u2019s proprietary recarbonation (ReCarbTM) process works by tapping into the existing feedstock and equipment at the plant, while production carries on as usual from the quarry to the kiln. Instead of then releasing CO2, the kiln exhaust is captured and mineralized into a cementitious material. The material can be co-blended with portland cement and used by ready mixed concrete producers as a Supplementary Cementitious Material (SCM) or as a cementitious binder for preformed concrete materials like bricks, blocks or precast structures.   The collaboration with Fortera aims to prove the commercial scalability, the quality of the final product, and the competitive economics of the technology.

The LEILAC 2 (Low Emissions Intensity Lime And Cement) carbon capture project has successfully passed its Financial Investment Decision milestone, confirming that the project can now enter the implementation phase. Together with the Australian technology company Calix and a European consortium, HeidelbergCement will proceed to build a demonstration facility integrated into HeidelbergCement\u2019s plant in Hanover, Germany. The installation will be designed to reduce 20 % of the CO2 emissions of the cement plant\u2019s CO2 emissions, corresponding to around 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year .   With the patented LEILAC technology, the CO2 released during cement production can be captured in a highly pure form via a separate waste gas stream and used in other processes. As minimal additional energy is needed and no chemicals are required, this happens in an especially cost-efficient way. The technology can also be retrofitted in a modular form at any scale and use any fuel or energy source, including biomass, hydrogen, or electricity \u2013 providing a \u2018future proof\u2019 solution.   \u201cLEILAC 2 is one of several carbon capture projects we are currently pursuing at HeidelbergCement,\u201d says Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board. \u201cWe are very pleased to advance this key technology at industrial scale at our plant in Hanover, Germany.    Once the technology has been successfully tested, we will be able to plan and install the technology for the actual permanent capture of CO2 in a second step, taking into account the site conditions in Hanover and the quality requirements for the CO2 for further use. The site is also optimally located to enable transport of the captured CO2 for further use or offshore storage.\"   HeidelbergCement aims to achieve CO2 reductions of up to 10 million tonnes by 2030 with several CCUS projects.  As part of the prior LEILAC 1 project, a CO2 capture pilot installation with a capture capacity of 25,000 tonnes of CO2 per year had been developed at HeidelbergCement's Lixhe plant in Belgium. With LEILAC 2, an installation around four times as large will be operated in Hanover. The project now enters the detailed design phase through 2022, followed by procurement and construction of the plant itself. Construction is expected in 2023, dependent on flag points over the coming months. The project scope for LEILAC 2 also includes a thorough analysis of the potential destination of the captured CO2, either for utilisation purposes or for safe geological offshore storage.  Phil Hodgson, Calix MD and CEO and Chairman of the LEILAC Executive Board: \u201cThe start of the implementation phase marks a significant milestone and further demonstrates the momentum which is building around the LEILAC project. It is testament to the strong level of collaboration which has been cultivated between the consortium partners, who have all worked together to make significant progress on this breakthrough project.\u201d   About LEILAC  The LEILAC consortium is led by the LEILAC Group (technology provider Calix), and comprises HeidelbergCement, CEMEX, Cimpor, IKN, Lhoist, Port of Rotterdam, BGR, RBINS-GSB, CERTH, POLIMI, LEAP, and Engie.

At this year\u2019s Capital Markets Day, HeidelbergCement today presented new medium-term sustainability and financial targets under the motto \u201cConcrete Promises\u201d.  \u201cWe are rigorously driving forward the transformation of HeidelbergCement to become the world's most sustainable company in our sector,\u201d says Dr Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. \u201cWe have the ambition, speed, knowledge, technologies, and partners to lead the necessary change process in our sector. Our focus is on expanding our portfolio of sustainable products, reducing our CO2 emissions quickly and significantly, proving that CO2-free products are possible on a large scale, and creating a circular economy by consistently applying the principles of circularity. Our new sustainability targets for 2030 illustrate this ambition.\u201d  Dr Dominik von Achten adds: \u201cAt the same time, we are convinced that we can also achieve this change in an economically sustainable way. We have created the conditions for this in recent years. We are building on a strong basis and are better positioned today than ever. In the coming years, we want to continue to grow profitably above the market and further increase the return on invested capital.\u201d  #### New climate targets and sustainable products as game changers for profitable growth  Dr Nicola Kimm, Member of the Managing Board and Chief Sustainability Officer of HeidelbergCement, says: \u201cWe are significantly tightening our climate targets. With the reduction of specific net CO2 emissions to 400kg\/t of cementitious material by 2030, we are establishing the most ambitious goal in the sector.\u201d This target corresponds to a reduction of 47% compared with the base year 1990 and is significantly higher than the previous reduction target of 33% for 2030 in the same period. Compared to 2021, the company aims to reduce CO2 emissions by a further 30%. Thus, in the next eight years, CO2 emissions are to decrease more strongly in percentage terms than in the last three decades. \u201cWe are focusing on the optimisation of products and processes, as well as in particular on the expansion of CO2 capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS)\u201d, adds Dr Nicola Kimm. The company aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. At HeidelbergCement, the reduction of CO2 emissions is also embedded in the remuneration of the Managing Board and all bonus-eligible employees worldwide.  At the product level, the focus is on the widescale adoption of ever lower carbon cements and concrete, the rapid acceleration of the use of recycled materials, and the use of new technologies such as 3D concrete printing. By 2030, HeidelbergCement aims to increase its revenue with sustainable products to a share of 50% of Group revenue. Only recently, HeidelbergCement expanded its sustainable concrete portfolio in Germany under the EcoCrete brand. With the \u201cecolution\u201d programme, the company will in future record the revenue of all products that meet at least one of four defined sustainability criteria.   #### Rapid scaling of CO2 capture technologies   CCUS is a crucial component of HeidelbergCement's climate strategy. In dealing with the unavoidable process emissions from clinker production, the company is focusing on the expansion and scaling of its CCUS initiatives: In order to gain experience with all important CO2 capture technologies, HeidelbergCement is further developing different technologies and cooperating with qualified partners. Promising projects can thus be scaled up to industrial-scale promptly and cost-effectively. Solely with CCUS projects that have already been launched, the company aims to save 10mt of CO2 cumulatively by 2030.   \u201cCCUS is the only way so far to be able to produce CO2-free cement and concrete,\u201d says Dr Dominik von Achten. \u201cWe are very well positioned here and are thus able to reduce our operating expenses, also through lower costs for CO2 allowances. This is a clear competitive advantage for HeidelbergCement and an opportunity to sustainably improve margins, especially in Europe.\u201d  #### New financial targets underpin sustainability strategy  \u201cWe have already achieved our financial targets ahead of schedule, which we had promised in our Beyond 2020 strategy. Now we are sharpening them \u2013 in addition to our new sustainability targets,\u201d says Dr Dominik von Achten. On a comparable basis, the company aims to increase revenue by around 5% p.a. over the next few years. The RCOBD margin should be between 20-22% by 2025. In addition, HeidelbergCement is raising its original target of achieving a return on invested capital (ROIC) of \u201cclearly above 8%\u201d and now aims to achieve a ROIC of over 10%. Net investments, including investments in sustainable products, processes, and CCUS technologies, are expected to be \u20ac1.1 billion p.a. on average. In this way, the company strives to use the previous investment framework as far as possible for the sustainability transformation, even with the use of the new technologies. HeidelbergCement aims to increase the cash conversion, i.e. the ratio of free cash flow to the result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation, prospectively to over 45%. As before, the leverage ratio is to be between 1.5x-2.0x.  HeidelbergCement will also become a leader in the sector in the area of financing. Ren\u00e9 Aldach, Chief Financial Officer of HeidelbergCement, explains: \u201cBy 2025, more than 70 % of our debt is to be covered by sustainable financial instruments. Among other things, we are relying on a bond programme that is the first in the industry to be aligned with the climate goals of the EU taxonomy.\u201d  For HeidelbergCement, helping to shape the transformation and taking innovative paths means assuming responsibility towards the environment and society, as well as developing solutions that are convincing sustainably. \u201cWe drive the change for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders, our employees, and society as a whole,\u201d said Dr Dominik von Achten, concluding his presentation today.

It reduces the carbon footprint of the end-to-end process by up to 70 .\nUnder the terms of this agreement, Lafarge will have the right to commercialize this technology worldwide. Lafarge will offer a complete solution (sustainable cement and CO\n2\n-cured concrete) in partnership with Solidia.\nCommercial launch will first take place in some key markets in North America and in Europe for the manufacturing of concrete elements such as paving stones, roof tiles and concrete blocks.\nThis partnership illustrates Lafarge\u2019s commitment to bring to the market innovative solutions contributing to building better cities. Lafarge has been working for over 20 years to reduce its environmental footprint and, in particular, its CO\n2\nemissions. These have been reduced by 26 per ton of cement since 1990.\n\nA breakthrough technology\nSolidia has developed a new binder made from similar raw materials to Ordinary Portland Cement and produced in a traditional rotary kiln. It is produced at lower temperatures and through a different chemical reaction that generates less CO\n2\n.\nUsed afterwards in the manufacture of precast concrete, Solidia Cement\u2122 hardens through the addition and absorption of CO\n2\n(\u2018carbonation\u2019), in a patented curing process that reduces the overall carbon footprint by up to 70 .\nProduced at traditional precast concrete manufacturing facilities, Solidia Concrete\u2122 is higher performing and reaches full strength in less than 24 hours, compared to 28 days for precast concrete made using Ordinary Portland Cement. This offers considerable energy savings and cost reductions to precast concrete manufacturers.\n\nA successful partnership\nLafarge has collaborated with Solidia Technologies since 2013 to industrialize this technology.\nLafarge researchers and technical experts worked with Solidia to demonstrate the feasibility of commercial-scale production in a conventional cement plant. In April 2014, a joint group of Lafarge and Solidia scientists validated the reduced carbon footprint and commercial viability of Solidia cement during a full-scale trial at Lafarge's Whitehall cement plant in the US. \u00a0The cement produced has subsequently been used by a variety of pre-cast customers in North America and Europe to further validate Solidia's curing technology and to produce blocks, pavers and roof tiles for commercial testing. Collaborative testing performed with many customers in recent months has demonstrated both the superior quality of Solidia concrete products and their cost competitiveness.\nIn December 2014, Lafarge invested in Solidia Technologies and joined Solidia\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nAbout Solidia Technologies\u00ae\nSolidia Technologies\u00ae makes it easy and profitable to use CO\n2\nto create superior and sustainable building materials. Solidia\u2019s patented technology starts with a sustainable cement, cures concrete with CO2 instead of water, reduces carbon emissions up to 70 , and recycles 60 to 100 of the water used in production. Using the same raw materials and existing equipment as traditional concretes, the resulting CO2-cured concrete products are higher performing, cost less to produce, and cure in less than 24 hours. Currently in commercialization for large- and small-scale applications, Solidia\u2019s R&D collaborators include Lafarge, The Linde Group, DOT\u2019s Federal Highway Administration, DOE\u2019s National Energy Technology Laboratory, Rutgers University, Purdue University, Ohio University, and the University of South Florida.

The manufacture of burnt bricks, the main building material in Malawi, is a significant contributor as a result of the wood-fired clamp kilns used in the production process.\nLafargeHolcim has developed an alternative solution to burnt bricks. Durabric, designed by the Group's R&D centre, is produced from a mixture of earth and cement compressed in a mould, and left naturally to cure in the sun without firing. Durabric contributes to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the deforestation associated with wood fuel consumption. The bricks are also more resistant than fired bricks and reduce construction costs.\n\u201cDurabric offers many benefits compared to the traditional bricks used for construction in the developing world: it is easy to manufacture, has a smaller environmental footprint, offers more resistance, and all at a lower cost,\u201d explains G\u00e9rard Kuperfarb, Member of LafargeHolcim\u2019s Executive Committee in charge of Growth and Innovation. \u201cThrough the new company we are setting up with CDC, we will accelerate the development of this affordable, low-carbon solution in developing markets where traditional bricks are commonly used.\u201d\nMore than three million of these bricks have already been produced in Malawi, and have been used in around 500 buildings. A brick production plant is being built to increase availability of Durabric in Malawi.\nCombining skills to scale up the solution\nThe aim of the new company, which will be managed by LafargeHolcim, will be to extend the offer developed in Malawi \u2013 including the provision of equipment to make the bricks, on-site technical support and training for brick makers \u2013 into other developing countries that are affected by deforestation resulting from the use of wood-fired bricks.\nCDC, which is wholly owned by the UK Government\u2019s Department for International Development (\u201cDfID\u201d) will invest alongside LafargeHolcim and contribute its expertise in investing in projects with a strong social and environmental dimension.\nAbout LafargeHolcim\nWith a well-balanced presence in 90 countries and a focus on cement, aggregates and concrete, LafargeHolcim (SIX Swiss Exchange, Euronext Paris: LHN) is the world leader in the building materials industry.

The objective is to build the world\u2019s first full-cycle solution to capture and reuse CO\n2\nfrom a cement plant while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The project is a partnership between Lafarge Canada, Inventys and Total.\nOver the next four years, Project CO\u2082MENT will demonstrate and evaluate Inventys\u2019 CO\u2082 Capture System and a selection of LafargeHolcim\u2019s carbon utilization technologies at its Richmond, British Columbia, Canada cement plant. The project has three phases and is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2020. Subject to the pilot\u2019s success, the vision is to scale up the project and explore how the facility can be replicated across other LafargeHolcim plants.\nDuring the first phase the partners will work on purifying the cement flue gas in preparation for CO\n2\ncapture. The second phase will focus on the separation of CO\n2\nfrom flue gas using a customized for cement version of Inventys\u2019 carbon capture technology at pilot scale. As part of the final phase, the captured CO\n2\nwill be prepared for reuse and support the economical assessment and demonstration of CO\n2\nconversion technologies onsite, such as CO\n2\ninjected concrete and fly ash.\nApart from increasing its focus on new innovative breakthrough solutions such as the CO\u2082MENT project, LafargeHolcim is also further investing into measures to reduce the clinker-to-cement ratio and consume less energy per tonne of cement by using lower carbon fuels and improving the efficiency of the company\u2019s processes. At its Richmond plant, the company recently launched a new and improved lower carbon fuel (LCF) system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of cement. It will also help minimize landfill waste; specifically, non-recyclable plastics that are creating a backlog for municipalities across Canada.\nThe CAD 28 million system is expected to replace up to 50 per cent of fossil fuel use with lower carbon fuels and could result in a 20 per cent reduction of combustion emissions. It also allows Lafarge Canada to divert approximately 100,000 tonnes per year of waste from local landfills, the equivalent of about 8,300 loaded garbage trucks.\nRen\u00e9 Thibault, Region Head North America: \u201cLafargeHolcim is committed to reducing CO2 emissions and we are excited to join forces with Inventys and Total through Project CO\u2082MENT. We hope to discover ways to capture emissions from our production processes and reuse them in our products, advancing a circular economy even further than today. The recent launch of the new LCF system at our Richmond plant aims to make the facility the most carbon efficient cement plant in Canada. Our investment alongside funding support from the British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy has made the system economically viable and demonstrates a long term commitment to the environment as well as the British Columbia cement market.\u201d\nLafargeHolcim cement is already among the most carbon efficient in the world. Since 1990, the company has reduced its net carbon emissions per tonne of cement by 25 percent, making LafargeHolcim the leader of international cement companies, with the highest reduction compared to the 1990 baseline. Canada will be pushing to reduce its carbon footprint even further through expanded lower carbon fuels, growth in supplementary cementitious materials and energy efficiency initiatives.\n\nAbout LafargeHolcim\nLafargeHolcim is the global leader in building materials and solutions.

The objective is to reduce annual CO2 emissions in Europe by a further 15 percent like-for-like, representing 3 million tons\n1\n, by 2022. This will be achieved with an investment of CHF 160 million into advanced equipment as well as technologies to increase the use of low-carbon fuels and recycled materials in the company\u2019s processes and products. Further funds are earmarked for the introduction of new carbon-efficient materials and services. Over the next three years, LafargeHolcim will work on more than 80 projects across 19 European countries.\nMarcel Cobuz, Region Head Europe: \u201cWe are cognizant of our impact on the environment and will remain at the forefront of efforts to mitigate climate change. With this investment in Europe, we are taking a further step to become more carbon-efficient. We are not only investing to reduce CO2 in our own operations, but are also seeking the collaboration with our customers across the value-chain to improve the carbon efficiency of buildings and infrastructure throughout their lifecycle.\u201d\nOne of the key levers to improve carbon-efficiency is to integrate the principle of circular economy into the cement production process by using waste materials instead of fossil fuels and primary raw materials. In 2018, LafargeHolcim repurposed 11 million tons of waste materials including 2 million tons of non-recyclable plastics that would otherwise end up in e.g. landfills creating further CO2 emissions. By stepping up its efforts in Europe the company aims at repurposing an additional 1.5 million tons of waste which would lead to avoiding 1 million tons of CO2 per year.\nAs part of the roadmap, LafargeHolcim will also increase the use of mineral alternatives and waste materials. On average, LafargeHolcim already uses 4.5 million tons to replace clinker with by-products from other industries. It is during the production of clinker, the main component of cement, when most CO2 emissions associated with cement occur. Additional efforts to replace clinker will allow the company to increase the CO2 efficiency of its cements produced in Europe by 1 million tons.\nPortfolio of low-carbon solutions to be expanded across Europe\nIn all countries, LafargeHolcim is working on products and services to help its customers improve the carbon efficiency of buildings and infrastructure across their lifecycle. In France, for example, the company has recently launched Lafarge360, a new integrated offer that includes scoring and carbon footprint modelling enabling customers to make informed decisions around the environmental impact of their project. Furthermore, low-carbon products are designed in France, Poland and Romania for soil stabilizations ensuring a better life cycle assessment of the road structure. The company is also working on masonry cements in France and Romania with a carbon footprint that is 50 percent lower than pure cement while ensuring enhanced properties like workability or wall adhesion. With Airium LafargeHolcim has developed an innovative, safe, green, durable and affordable insulation alternative to traditional insulation. Priority countries for this solution include France, Austria, Switzerland and Poland.\nLafargeHolcim is a preferred building materials partner for low-carbon construction solutions. Its innovative concrete and cement products allow for CO2 savings of up to 70 percent compared to standard Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) products. The company is committed to continuous carbon intensity reduction of its portfolio, as demonstrated by its leadership position on carbon efficiency (576kg CO2 \/ ton of cementitious material in 2018) as well as an ambitious 2030 target (520kg CO2 per ton of cementitious material) aligned with the 2\u00b0C scenario of the Paris COP21 climate agreement.\nTo find out more about LafargeHolcim\u2019s unique perspective on sustainability in the building materials industry, make sure you subscribe to Material Talks for cutting-edge technology, breakthrough innovation and pioneering achievements that will make the built environment more sustainable.

This makes us one of the world\u2019s leading renewable energy companies. We intend annual net investments of 1.5 billion euros to consolidate and further strengthen this position. Now we are putting all our energy into tackling this task.\"  Dr. Rolf Martin Schmitz, CEO of RWE AG  Carbon neutral by 2040, one of the world\u00b4s leading renewable energy companies, a responsible producer of power from all energy sources \u2013 this is the formula behind the new RWE. Based on a three-stage CO2 reduction plan, the company has set itself ambitious goals for its strategic realignment. RWE intends to become a carbon neutral company within the next 20 years.   RWE decreased its carbon dioxide emissions by one-third from 2012 to 2018, representing a decline of 60 million metric tons. An additional reduction of approximately 70 percent is envisaged by 2030. RWE will decommission its last coal-fired power station in the United Kingdom to this end. In Germany, more of the Group\u2019s coal power plants will gradually be taken offline, following the recommendations of the Commission for Structural Change. The Dutch government wants its country\u2019s coal-based electricity generation to end by 2030. RWE is in the process of converting the plants in Eemshaven and Amer to fire biomass. The objective is to transform electricity generation from fossil fuel in order to achieve carbon neutral production. In addition to a large international portfolio including wind turbines and photovoltaic units which the company intends to expand continuously, RWE will then place its chips on storage, biomass and gas-fired power stations primarily fired by \u2018green\u2019 gas, which will be indispensable to achieving security of supply. \u201cThis presents RWE with a huge task. But we have a very clear idea of how to achieve our goal: We will phase out fossil energy sources both consistently and responsibly. We will make huge investments in wind and solar power as well as in high-capacity storage technologies. The new RWE is and will remain one of the major players in the electricity generation business,\u201d declares Rolf Martin Schmitz, CEO of RWE AG.  Growing renewable energy is the clear focus of the new RWE. The renewable energy portfolios of E.ON and innogy, combined to form RWE Renewables, will turn the company into a \u201cglobal player made in Germany\u201d with an installed capacity of more than 9 gigawatts. Added to this are further assets with a combined capacity of 2.6 gigawatts under construction that will be completed in the near future. The world\u2019s No. 2 in offshore wind and Europe\u2019s No. 3 in renewable energy \u2013 these are the starting positions that the company intends to consolidate and strengthen. RWE will provide an annual 1.5 billion euros in net capital expenditure for both offshore and onshore wind turbines as well as photovoltaics and storage. Project partnerships have the potential to increase total investment to between 2 and 3 billion euros per annum.  Diversification via technologies and regions as well as scale and financial strength are the key success factors in the renewables business. Diversification, in order to minimise interdependencies resulting from changing regulatory and political framework conditions. Scale, in order to put technological progress into practice and reduce electricity generation costs. Financial strength, in order to spur growth. These are the decisive factors RWE where to develop renewables projects around the globe.  RWE\u2019s transformation is reflected in its earnings as well. Going forward, only 20 percent of EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) will come from the conventional business. Three times as much, i.e. about 60 percent, will be earned from business with renewable energies, while energy trading will be contributing 10 percent. The remaining 10 percent will come from financial investments, including Amprion, Kelag and E.ON. \u201cIn the last few years, we have worked hard to give RWE a robust financial setup and make the company fit for the future. Today, our operations are profitable, our processes are efficient, and we offer our shareholders an attractive dividend. We have the financial, strategic and personnel power required to run renewable energy operations all over the world. This is an outstanding basis from which to seize the opportunities of the future,\u201d underlines CFO Markus Krebber.   The tasks are distributed clearly. In addition to a lean holding company, the new RWE and its 20,000 employees worldwide will consist of four operating companies: RWE Renewables, RWE Supply & Trading, RWE Generation and RWE Power.  \u201cLignite and nuclear energy have laid the foundations we are building the new RWE on. Past, current and future employees working in conventional areas have our utmost respect. But every form of energy has its time. Now we are opening a new chapter of our corporate history, which looks back on over 120 years. With great enthusiasm for the new world, without forgetting where we came from. Openness, fairness and respect for each other\u2019s work will characterise the new RWE as well,\u201d says Rolf Martin Schmitz.   ### Downloads    * Press Release","article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2019-09-30-the-new-rwe","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"pdf_url not found.

The cluster brings together industrial partners to help investigate and unlock the potential options for decarbonising the region\u2019s industrial processes. As one of the world\u2019s renewable energy leaders and with an in-depth knowledge of hydrogen, we believe it is a perfect fit for RWE.\u201d   ####  Tom Glover, Chief Commercial Officer RWE Renewables and RWE UK Country Chair   RWE, Wales\u2019 largest energy generator, is set to launch a number of feasibility studies into the reduction of carbon emissions at its key assets in South Wales, thanks to a successful funding bid as part of the South Wales Industrial Cluster (SWIC). The cluster funding has been announced today and comes from Innovate UK and the UK Government\u2019s Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Industrial Decarbonisation Fund.   In addition to the UK, RWE is involved in hydrogen and carbon reduction projects in Germany and the Netherlands across all areas of the value chain, making the company a perfect partner for the SWIC consortium. The new studies will investigate how hydrogen and carbon capture can help reduce carbon emissions from RWE\u2019s 2.2 gigawatts (GW) gas-fired Pembroke Power Station. They will also look into the feasibility of establishing a new green hydrogen production facility to support the SWIC partners within the industrial cluster.  Tom Glover said: \u201cPembroke is the most modern and efficient gas power plant in the UK and will play a vital role in supporting the energy transition over the coming years. It is important to understand the potential of hydrogen and carbon capture opportunities to ensure cleaner energy and industry in the coming years, as well as helping to secure skilled jobs for the region.\u201d   Sopna Sury, Chief Operating Officer RWE Generation added: \u201cWe believe that hydrogen is a real game changer in the transition to a low carbon economy. Therefore, RWE will contribute its broad expertise in hydrogen, renewables and as the UK\u2019s second largest generator of electricity, to support the success of these three feasibility projects.\u201d  SWIC is a consortium of Wales\u2019 major industry, energy, infrastructure, law, academic and engineering organisations and RWE is a key member. The cluster has been successful in securing support from the public and private sector, to develop a range of partner projects including; the production and use of a hydrogen supply, carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) and CO2 shipping from South Wales which would be the first CO2 shipping industry in the whole of the UK. Together these projects can decarbonise industry and power in South Wales and create a net zero emissions industrial zone by 2040.  In 2020 the UK government announced a 10 Point Plan to deliver a Green Industrial Revolution to mobilise \u00a312 billion of Government investment and create 250,000 jobs in the green economy, \u00a31 billion of which was pledged to create carbon capture clusters.  Dr Chris Williams, who is heading up SWIC for Industry Wales, said: \u201cThe UK Government has set in law that the UK needs to be Net Zero by 2050, the South Wales Industrial Cluster has ambitions to do this by 2040. The collaboration and support of all partners has been pivotal to SWIC\u2019s achievements so far.\u201c  The deployment phase will help unlock the route to Net Zero in South Wales, helping support the future of existing industries, businesses and jobs. Once developed, the net zero infrastructure will attract new industries and businesses, further developing the production and use of hydrogen for home heating, power generation and transport across the region.  RWE has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the development of hydrogen projects across Europe including involvement in GET H2 , NortH2 and AquaVentus. The company will utilise the experience from its newly developed hydrogen team to support this activity within the cluster.  RWE is involved in all stages of the hydrogen value chain, ranging from electricity generation from renewables to hydrogen generation and storage, through to distribution to industrial customers. Through its gas-fired power stations, such as Pembroke Power Station in Wales, in the long-term the company is positioned to be an off-taker of low-carbon hydrogen for firm, flexible power. It will also support RWE\u2019s target to be carbon neutral by 2040.

The Korean POSCO Group is one of the world's leading steel producers. The cargo was delivered to the Gwangyang Terminal, South Korea. Under the agreement between RWE and POSCO, carbon emissions associated with the LNG cargo from wellhead to delivery, including exploration, production and transport, have been offset. This is achieved through the retirement of a corresponding amount of carbon credits, so called Verified Emissions Reductions (VER) certificates. High quality carbon credits have been sourced and independently certified under the internationally recognised Gold Standard, which adheres to strict environmental and social principles, and will be retired in order to compensate for the associated CO2 emissions of producing and delivering the cargo to Korea. The carbon emission intensity of the cargo delivery was estimated using the Wood Mackenzie LNG Emissions Tool. RWE is now able to provide all its customers with the opportunity to offset carbon emissions related to LNG deliveries through the use of emission reduction certificates.  Ji-Won Suh, Senior Vice President at POSCO, says: \u201cWe acknowledge that tackling climate change is not a matter for the future but rather a pressing issue that requires immediate action to create a better world. As one of the biggest steelmakers, we aspire to fulfil our responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint. Therefore, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to RWE for supplying our first carbon-neutral LNG which represents much to our business based on our strong partnership. We will also seek opportunities to collaborate with all our stakeholders to build a net-zero society worldwide.\u201d  Javier Moret, Global Head of LNG at RWE Supply & Trading, is also convinced: \u201cWe believe offsetting of emissions can play an important role in fighting climate change during the transition to a carbon-free economy. Therefore, we are very pleased to have partnered together with our customer POSCO to deliver to them an LNG cargo with carbon offsets for their domestic market. Furthermore, we are delighted to be able to provide our customers with solutions for reducing their carbon intensity on a more regular basis in the future.\u201d  ### Downloads    * Press release","article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-supply-and-trading\/2021-03-29-rwe-delivers-lng-cargo-on-a-carbon-neutral-basis-to-korean-steel-company-posco","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-supply-and-trading\/2021\/2021-03-29-rwe-delivers-lng-cargo-on-a-carbon-neutral-basis-to-korean-steel-company-posco.pdf","error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

As one of the world\u2019s leading energy companies, RWE has significant expertise in onshore and offshore wind, developing green hydrogen production plants and operating large-scale gas plants. Pembroke is a unique site to establish a Net Zero Centre, which will showcase in one location the technologies that are essential to Wales\u2019s decarbonised future.\u201d  ####  Tom Glover, RWE UK Country Chair   RWE, one of the world\u2019s leading energy companies, today launches the Pembroke Net Zero Centre (PNZC) as a major initiative towards decarbonisation. With Pembroke Power Station located at its heart, the PNZC will draw on the extensive knowledge and expertise from across RWE\u2019s offshore wind, gas-fired generation and hydrogen businesses to demonstrate a pathway towards decarbonisation.  RWE is already Wales\u2019 largest power generator from both gas and renewables, with 12 sites that include onshore and offshore wind and hydro. The PNZC will work with hundreds of RWE experts across the Welsh, UK and international businesses in generation, renewables and trading, looking at the deployment of state-of-the-art technologies to help decarbonise the region and support Wales\u2019 Roadmap to Net Zero\u2019 by 2050.  PNZC is made up of three distinct pillars: green hydrogen production, including feasibility studies and potential development of an electrolyser on the Pembroke site, the development of floating offshore wind in the Celtic Sea and decarbonisation of Pembroke Power Station, including studies for carbon capture and the feasibility of hydrogen as a fuel.  Pembroke is the ideal location for the Net Zero Centre: RWE operates a large-scale gas-fired power station with access to gas and electricity networks, floating wind opportunities in the Celtic Sea and potential industrial off-takers for green hydrogen in South Wales (i.e. in the South Wales Industrial Cluster, SWIC).  Tom Glover said: \u201cPembroke is a unique place to house a decarbonisation centre. It has all the elements to become a SuperPlace for decarbonisation: floating offshore wind accessibility, land for development of large-scale electrolysers, electricity and gas grid connections and a gas-fired power station providing firm and flexible power. RWE\u2019s investment in decarbonisation has the potential to become the green power and gas provider to Wales, assisting other companies to meet their decarbonisation targets and helping Welsh Government achieve its ambition for Net Zero.\u201d  Pembroke is one of the most efficient gas power plants in the UK, playing a vital role in supporting the energy transition over the coming years. It is important to investigate the potential for hydrogen combustion and carbon capture, to ensure the supply of low carbon energy to industry and secure skilled jobs for the region.  Feasibility studies that have been part-funded by the UK Government will investigate how hydrogen and carbon capture can help reduce carbon emissions from Pembroke Power Station. These studies will also look into the feasibility of establishing a new green hydrogen production facility to support the SWIC partners within the industrial cluster. SWIC is a consortium of Wales\u2019 major industry, energy, infrastructure, law, academic and engineering organisations and RWE is a key member. The cluster brings together partner projects to decarbonise industry and power in South Wales.  RWE has nine offshore wind sites in operation, three of which are in Wales, with a capacity of 1328 MW (pro rata). Further offshore sites under construction and in development include Triton Knoll, Sofia and Awel y M\u00f4r. Floating offshore wind will play an important part in the growth of offshore renewable generation, and has the potential to unlock new markets around the world. RWE is actively investigating a number of floating wind opportunities in the UK and views the Celtic Sea opportunity as a major part of this.  RWE has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the development of hydrogen projects across Europe, including involvement in GET H2, NortH2 and AquaVentus. The company will utilise the experience from its Hydrogen Team to support this activity.  For more information about the Pembroke Net Zero Centre visit: www.rwe.com\/pnzc.

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was recently signed by Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE AG, and Wael Sawan, Director of Integrated Gas, Renewables and Energy Solutions at Royal Dutch Shell plc, at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland near Cologne. The aim of the MoU is to identify concrete project options which could then be developed toward investment decisions.  Hydrogen is crucial for the decarbonisation of industry and achieving climate neutrality in large-scale production and processing. Many companies can only achieve their climate goals through the use of hydrogen produced without CO2 emissions. Accordingly, the demand for green and blue hydrogen is increasing, and the two companies want to focus their cooperation on this potential.  RWE and Shell already have a background of positive cooperation through the pioneering projects NortH2 in the Netherlands and AquaVentus in Germany. In a next step, integrated projects for the production of green hydrogen, using offshore wind power on a gigawatt scale, will also be examined in the industrial regions in the north-east of England (such as, Teesside and\/or Humberside). RWE and Shell intend to jointly assess the future development of electrolysis plants to produce green hydrogen and consider locations which have potential pipeline capacity for hydrogen yet are currently difficult to connect to the electric grid. RWE and Shell want to investigate whether, and how, green energy can be transported from such locations to customers via hydrogen pipelines.  RWE and Shell also want to develop new green hydrogen solutions for industrial customers, focused on the Shell Energy & Chemicals Park Rheinland in Germany, Shell sites in Rotterdam and Moerdijk in the Netherlands, and on customers in their immediate vicinity.  In addition, RWE and Shell intend to evaluate the possible application of green hydrogen in the mobility sector in Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK. A starting point for this could be, for example, the hydrogen station network for heavy trucks which Shell plans to build between Rotterdam, Cologne and Hamburg by 2024.  In the MoU, the two companies also agreed to examine technical alternatives for the decarbonisation of RWE\u2019s gas and biomass power plants, such as the possibility of capturing and storing CO2. The companies will also examine the use of blue hydrogen in RWE's gas-fired power plants in Pembroke (Wales), Emsland (Germany) and Moerdijk (the Netherlands), among others. If progressed, Shell would produce and supply the hydrogen as well as capture and store the CO2. The results of the trial could be transferred later to other RWE sites, in parallel with the developing transport infrastructure for hydrogen and CO2.  \"We are delighted about this agreement with RWE. Both companies are of the opinion that progress towards net-zero emissions needs government policy to support the energy transition and our customers' needs for low-carbon energy solutions,\" said Wael Sawan, Director of Integrated Gas, Renewables and Energy Solutions at Royal Dutch Shell plc. \"It makes sense for us to evaluate the potential of joint decarbonisation projects and make the best of the global energy experience both companies bring to the table.\"  \"Effective climate action needs cross-sector and cross-national cooperation. In our cooperation with Shell, we want to develop solutions that combine new approaches with proven technologies and, above all, can be applied quickly and on a large scale. We will also contribute our special expertise in the development of offshore wind projects as well as the provision of energy in the form of electricity, heat and, in the future, green hydrogen for our customers,\" emphasised Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE.  ### Downloads    * Press release","article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-generation\/2021-11-10-shell-and-rwe-want-to-drive-energy-transition-forward","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-generation-se\/2021\/2021-11-10-shell-and-rwe-want-to-drive-energy-transition-forward.pdf","error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

At the same time, however, we need a flexible generation as a back-up to guarantee security of supply. The ultimate goal is for plants powered by green energy sources to take over this task, such as gas-fired power plants fuelled by green hydrogen. But until that point is reached, bridge solutions such as gas, LNG and blue hydrogen will be needed. We are therefore very pleased to be working with Novatek to evaluate possibilities to supply Europe with large quantities of blue and green hydrogen.\"  \u201cWe are very well positioned to benefit from the transition of global economies to low carbon energy sources,\u201d said Lev Feodosyev, Novatek\u2019s First Deputy Chairman of the Management Board. \u201cNatural gas including LNG is already replacing other types of fuels with higher carbon footprint, and we are working on decreasing the already low carbon footprint of LNG produced by our projects in the Russian Arctic. Now we are undertaking the pre-FEED study for the blue ammonia and hydrogen plant with CCS facilities nearby our LNG cluster in Yamal for the delivery to final customers of low-carbon products in Europe and Asia.\u201d  With its investment and growth strategy \u2018Growing Green\u2019 RWE wants to invest \u20ac50 billion gross through to 2030 to grow its green and flexible generation portfolio. Thanks to an installed capacity of 14 gigawatts (GW), RWE is currently operating the second-largest gas-fired power station fleet in Europe.  In the context of \u2018Growing Green\u2019, additional plants, which will have a clear decarbonisation roadmap, are planned and a roadmap for \u201cgreen conversion\u201d will be developed for all existing gas-fired power stations. RWE will also significantly expand its trading in green energy sources and its range of tailored energy solutions for large customers. RWE plans therefore to open up new business opportunities in the areas of hydrogen and ammonia importing, in order to supply industry in Europe.  ### Downloads    * Press release","article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-supply-and-trading\/2021-12-07-rwe-and-novatek-cooperate-on-decarbonisation-of-industry","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-supply-and-trading\/2021\/2021-12-07-rwe-and-novatek-cooperate-on-decarbonisation-of-industry.pdf","error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

The company recently launched the \u2018Pembroke Net Zero Centre\u2019 (PNZC) as the hub for RWE\u2019s decarbonisation projects and development activities in the Celtic Sea. PNZC is made up of three distinct pillars:    1. Decarbonisation of Pembroke Power Station via blending and combustion of clean hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, including feasibility studies on retrofitting the existing power plant;   2. Green Hydrogen production, including Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) studies for an initial 100-200MW \u2018pathfinder\u2019 electrolyser project to supply green hydrogen to local industry and transport, with GW-scale opportunities in the longer-term;   3. Floating Offshore Wind development in the Celtic Sea. RWE is seeking to build Giga-Watt scale floating wind in the Celtic Sea and has signed MoU\u2019s with ABP Port Talbot and the Port of Milford Haven to support this initiative.    To complement these decarbonisation ambitions RWE is also exploring large scale deployment of battery storage technology at the Pembroke site.  The Minister was taken on a tour of the site and shown the existing power station and the location of potential future infrastructure including a hydrogen electrolyser and battery storage. Skilled staff from the site were on hand to explain how the existing power plant, which generates enough power for 3.5m homes, operates.  The team also discussed with the Minister how the deployment of net zero technology at Pembroke Net Zero Centre will help unlock the route to Net Zero in South Wales, and help support the future of existing industries, businesses and jobs. This initiative, as part of the South Wales Industrial Cluster, will attract new industries and businesses, further developing the production and use of hydrogen for industrial usage, power generation and transport across the region. At the same time, in close collaboration with its partners, this initiative supports the development of infrastructure to transport hydrogen and carbon (CO2), e.g., by pipeline or by ship, necessary to decarbonise the UK\u2019s 2nd largest industrial cluster.  Tom Glover said, \u201dWe are delighted that the Minister for Economy, Vaughan Gething had the opportunity to meet our team at Pembroke. The site is unique with all elements to become a hub for decarbonisation, including floating offshore wind accessibility, land for the development of large-scale electrolysers, electricity and gas grid connections and a gas-fired power station providing firm and flexible power. RWE\u2019s investment in decarbonisation has the potential to see our company maintain its position as the green power leader in Wales.\u201d  Economy Minister, Vaughan Gething said: \u201cThe Welsh Government wants to see Wales become a global leader in new offshore renewable energy generation. It is not only great for our climate but has the potential to be a gamechanger for our economy, bring quality, skilled jobs to our communities.  \u201cRWE is a leader in the growing renewable energy sector and it will have a crucial role to play in helping us meet our ambitious decarbonisation aspirations. I was delighted to meet the team here at the Pembroke site and hear more about RWE\u2019s plans to use green hydrogen to decarbonise its existing assets.\u201d  ### Downloads    * Press release","article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-generation\/2022-06-27-rwe-welcomes-vaughan-gething-ms-to-pembroke-site","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-generation-se\/2022\/2022-06-27-rwe-welcomes-vaughan-gething-ms-to-pembroke-site.pdf","error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

The technology developed by thyssenkrupp lowers CO2 emissions in cement production by up to 40 percent. It involves replacing part of the cement clinker with calcined, i.e. thermally activated, clay. Cimpor Global Holdings will use the technology, known as \u201cpolysius activated clay\u201d, on an industrial scale at a new plant being built near the Cameroon sea port of Kribi. On completion in fall 2021, the plant will save more than 120,000 tons of CO2 emissions every year.\nAn important building material, cement is produced by an energy-intensive process in which large quantities of carbon dioxide are emitted. \u201cAt thyssenkrupp we are convinced that CO2-neutral cement production is fundamentally possible and can be achieved in several steps,\u201d says Pablo Hofelich, CEO of the Cement Technologies business unit. \u201cWe are already very advanced in many areas on the technology side. We offer our customers products that reduce environmental impact and at the same time reduce costs, making it possible for example to significantly cut CO2 and nitrogen oxide emissions and reduce the use of raw materials, water, or fossil fuels such as coal and gas.\u201d \nUnder the order, thyssenkrupp is carrying out engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of the new plant, which will produce 720 tons of activated clay per day. It is the second calcined clay project of Cimpor Global Holdings.\nActivated clay significantly reduces CO2 footprint and energy consumption\nCO2 is a natural constituent of limestone, the main component of cement. For each ton of cement clinker produced, around 790 kilograms of process-related CO2 is emitted. Around two thirds of this results from the limestone used, which releases CO2 in a chemical reaction in the production process. At the same time the process requires large amounts of energy, because for the production of cement clinker, limestone has to be heated with other aggregates to temperatures of more than 1,400 degrees Celsius. \nWith polysius activated clay, thyssenkrupp has developed a technology that allows around one third of the cement clinker to be replaced with activated clay. The clay is heated to around 800 degrees Celsius \u2013 significantly less heat than is needed to produce clinker. Thanks to the significant energy saving in the production of thermally activated clays and the changed chemical composition, CO2 emissions per ton of cement can be cut by up to 40 percent. \nReduced dependence on expensive clinker imports\nClay is available in huge quantities worldwide \u2013 particularly also in developing countries with growing cement demand such as in Southeast Asia and large parts of Africa and Latin America. In the past clay has often been discarded as a waste product in mining. With polysius activated clay technology, thyssenkrupp offers an innovative solution for the industrial use of clay as a substitute material and a sustainable, low-cost alternative to conventional cement clinker. \n\u201cOur technology is not only eco-friendlier, it also creates cost advantages for our customers such as Cimpor Global Holdings,\u201d says Dr. Luc Rudowski, Head of Product Management and Innovation at the Cement Technologies business unit. \u201cIn many regions, limestone is in short supply and clinker has to be imported at high cost. Also, stricter environmental requirements and emissions levies in more and more countries are forcing cement producers to rethink. They need an alternative that is cost-efficient and at the same time delivers high-quality cement. That\u2019s exactly what polysius activated clay technology provides.\u201d \nClimate-neutral cement production a step closer\nAlongside technology for the production of thermally activated clays, thyssenkrupp is working on further products and processes for the \u201cgreen\u201d cement plant of the future. One example is Oxyfuel technology. While the use of activated clay helps substantially reduce CO2 emissions and energy consumption, a certain amount of limestone is still needed because it is essential for the strength behavior of concrete.\nWith its pure oxyfuel process, thyssenkrupp has developed a solution for capturing and utilizing the CO2 released from the limestone during clinker production. Instead of ambient air, pure oxygen is used for the combustion process. Because no nitrogen enters the process, the resultant CO2 is highly concentrated and can be separated and stored or reused much more easily, for example as a chemical raw material.\nAbout us:\nThe thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions AG is a leading partner for the engineering, construction and service of industrial plants and systems. Based on more than 200 years of experience we supply tailored, turnkey plants and components for customers in the chemical, fertilizer, cement, mining and steel industries.

Involving 16 further partners the project, which is funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), has over the past four years gathered fundamental insights into the conversion of steel mill process gases into chemical products. The next step is to extend the solution to other industries, demonstrate its long-term stability and make it ready for the market. To this end, Federal Minister Anja Karliczek handed over notice of 75 million euros further funding for the period up to 2024.\nDecisive phase completed\nThe BMBF provided more than 60 million euros in funding for the first phase of the project in 2016. Since then, important milestones have been reached: shortly after the pilot plant in Duisburg started operation in March 2018, ammonia, methanol and higher alcohols were successfully produced from steel mill process gases for the first time. In addition to the CO2 from these gases, Carbon2Chem\u00ae also uses hydrogen. To pave the way for climate-neutral production, a two megawatt alkaline water electrolyzer from thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers was operated in the pilot plant. It was shown that the water electrolyzer could be operated with highly volatile renewable energy without suffering damage. The implementation of chemical synthesis using commercially available catalysts and gas cleaning using commercially available process stages by thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions is proof of the high technology readiness level (TRL) of the project. In addition, commercial viability as well as the positive ecological effect were confirmed by all project partners.\nNext phase: Extension to other industries and market readiness\nIn the now launched second phase of the project, the aim is to demonstrate long-term stability in the complex interactions between steel production and chemical synthesis, and show that the Carbon2Chem\u00ae technology can be upscaled quickly in a cross-industry network. In addition, the focus will be on transferability to other industries besides steel production. To this end, additional sectors are to be included in the project as major CO2 sources \u2013 for example cement and lime producers and waste incineration plants.

The study is focused on validating the furnace technology (\u201cmelting unit\u201d) as an intelligent approach to prepare the direct reduced iron for further processing in the existing steel mill. The scientists have come to the clear conclusion that the concept pursued by the Duisburg-based steel producer is technologically feasible, scalable and innovative.\nStudy confirms feasibility and provides findings for designing the unit\nOn the basis of thermochemical simulations developed especially for the study, the scientists confirm thyssenkrupp\u2019s main assumptions: The planned melting unit is suitable to melt down the iron reduced in the direct reduction plant, thus producing a liquid hot metal-like material to be processed in the steel mill. The study examined various technical factors such as energy requirements, positioning of electrodes, dimensions of the \u201cmelting unit\u201d and the principal usability of slags. Aside from the technical feasibility, the study also provided findings that will now be used for designing the new unit.\nProf. Dr. Bernd Friedrich, Director of IME Metallurgische Prozesstechnik und Metallrecycling at RWTH Aachen University: \u201cThe decarbonization of the steel industry is a one-in-a-hundred-years task. thyssenkrupp Steel has developed an innovative and technically feasible solution to avoid CO2 emissions in the steelmaking process by using hydrogen and green power. The projected \u201cmelting unit\u201d is an intelligent solution which can be used worldwide to decarbonize integrated steel mills via the direct reduction route. The existing steel mills can thus be maintained and operated on an ongoing basis. This means that in future all existing steel grades can be produced in the usual quality, but largely in a CO2-neutral way\u201c.\n  \nMelting unit enables minimal disruption and maximum range of grades\nTo thyssenkrupp Steel, the factor \u201csteel mill\u201d is essential on its way to climate transformation. As part of the corporate strategy, the company focuses on high-quality premium grades and hence also on the established processes in the two BOF meltshops at the Duisburg site. Early in 2021, the company approved investments in the high three-digit million range to strengthen the capacities in these product segments and important markets of the future like e-mobility.\nThis study now provides thyssenkrupp Steel with external confirmation of the model for integrating the direct reduction process into the existing metallurgical network in Duisburg. This means that the steel mill can be decarbonized with the lowest possible cost and effort, and, in the long term, the entire portfolio of grades can be produced climate neutrally, including all premium grades. The climate strategy thus fits seamlessly into the company's product strategy, which is focused on premium grades.\nDr. Arnd K\u00f6fler, CTO of thyssenkrupp Steel: \u201cTechnologically, we are ready to go. We can make our Duisburg steel site climate-neutral by changing the production chains very specifically and only where CO2 emissions arise: by replacing the blast furnaces. The downstream value chain and the established processes associated with it remain in place. That's what makes the concept so attractive: we replace the coal, but we don't replace the steel mill and all downstream units.\"\nBernhard Osburg, CEO of thyssenkrupp Steel: \u201cThe study confirms a key element of our transformation path. There is already a demand for green steel, and we have the technologically innovative and capable concept to meet it. This has now been confirmed by independent third parties. Above all, we will be able to offer our customers our entire product range in the \u201cgreen\u201c version, without compromising quality. We now have to dispel existing uncertainties in the framework conditions, especially with regard to funding and the regulatory framework. First of all, we need planning security to establish a robust and competitive business model for green steel.

{"company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2021-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Primetals Technologies and thyssenkrupp join forces to launch an innovative blast furnace technology enabling a key step towards carbon neutrality","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Products and solutions","preview_text":null,"article_text":"* Increases blast furnace efficiency and reduces costs\n  * Reduces CO2 emissions\n  * Offers a rapid return on investment\n  * Exclusive, worldwide cooperation agreement\nPrimetals Technologies and thyssenkrupp have signed an exclusive, worldwide cooperation agreement which sees both parties commit to bringing the innovative Sequence Impulse Process (known as SIP for short) technology to the market. The SIP technology has been developed by thyssenkrupp AT.Pro tec, a company of thyssenkrupp Materials Services, and is well established for use in foundry cupola furnaces. The underlying principles of this proven technology have been adapted and specifically tailored to the blast furnace process. To prove the technology, thyssenkrupp Steel Europe has installed the first ever full system on their blast furnace #1 at Schwelgern, Duisburg in Germany.\nBlast furnace operators can conventionally lower operating costs through injection of alternative fuels with the hot air blast (most commonly pulverized coal) in order to reduce the required coke rate in the burden. Additional oxygen enrichment is required to promote combustion for the added fuel. Whilst benefiting the economic aspects for the furnace, this also results in a number of process and operational challenges. Combustion of the fuel localized in the raceway entry leads to higher heat loads on the shell and un-combusted material (char) can accumulate in the burden. This impedes gas flow and drainage, ultimately reducing the furnace performance efficiency.\nThe patented SIP technology acts to repurpose the enrichment oxygen, and deliver a series of controlled, high-energy pulses, increasing local concentration in the raceway. The resulting action is improved combustion and conversion of fuel, leading to better gas distribution and drainage potential. Additionally, through higher penetration of the oxygen, the heat load generated is moved more to the central zone of the furnace. The small coke proportion in the burden can be increased without loss of permeability or increased overall pressure drop. These conditions permit an increase in the replacement of coke with injectant and higher production potential whist avoiding deterioration of the process conditions.\nTotal fuel rate can be lowered and, as a result, the added benefit of reduced carbon dioxide emission is achieved. The SIP technology therefore brings multiple advantages in terms of significant savings in overall operating costs and supports the blast furnace operators in their moves towards carbon neutrality.\n\u201cThe cooperation makes a lot of sense for Primetals Technologies because our plant building competence and blast furnace process knowledge are complemented by thyssenkrupp\u2019s vast operating expertise, particularly on large units. We\u2019ve been engaged for some time now in supporting our customers in developing their roadmaps to carbon neutrality. We know that new technologies will eventually replace the blast furnace, but these will take a long time to mature. Currently process improvements which reduce costs and improve the green credentials are critically important to steelmakers globally. This technical development is not only time relevant, but the strength of each partner also makes this a great fit to meet customer expectations.\u201d says Paul Freeman, Director of the Blast Furnace Business for Primetals Technologies UK.\nJ\u00f6rg Glebe, Managing Director of thyssenkrupp AT.PRO tec GmbH says \"By optimizing the consumption of the reducing agents coke and coal, we have a major lever for efficiency improvements, cost and CO2 savings.

Today, the first batches were delivered under the new brand name bluemint\u00ae Steel. The first customer to be supplied with flat steel products of the bluemint\u00ae family is the Ahlen-based premium bathroom builder Kaldewei. The approach to reducing the CO2 emissions at the blast furnace, which has been independently assured by the international certification body DNV, allows for the allocation of the carbon emission savings to a specific quantity of the product bluemint\u00ae pure. The carbon emission intensity per tonne of steel produced is thus reduced by 70 per cent. The benefits that can be achieved using this approach were also confirmed by Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy \u2013 thyssenkrupp Steel's advisor to the project.\nCalculation method for emission control in alignment with international standards\nbluemint\u00ae pure has all direct emissions from its production at the Duisburg site neutralized by savings in the production process\u2013 the emissions of the so-called upstream chain (Scope 3) are retained. These include all emissions that occur during the production and transportation of the raw materials. In this way, the emission intensity per tonne is reduced by 1.5 tonnes to 0.6 tonnes of CO2 per tonne product, which corresponds to an overall reduction of 70 per cent. This positive effect is achieved through the use of already reduced iron (HBI). This allows for less coal consumption in the reduction process at the blast furnace. This achieves a verifiable reduction of emissions. Priti Hoffmann, Sustainability lead, Benelux at DNV: \u201cDNV reviewed the methodology developed by thyssenkrupp Steel and the data from an initial trial period of HBI use in a blast furnace at their Duisburg plant. I am pleased that DNV Business Assurance has played an essential role for thyssenkrupp Steel in this landmark launch of bluemint\u00ae pure steel products. bluemint\u00ae pure steel certificates, for steel products with a reduced CO2 intensity, are based on CO2 savings in the steel production process which are achieved by changing input materials in the blast furnace. These savings are then allocated to a quantity of steel products, according to a methodology, which has been assured by DNV. The methodology for calculating product-related CO2 savings is in accordance with the internationally recognised Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard.\u201d\nThe fact that carbon savings allocation approaches can support the decarbonisation of the steel sector is acknowledged by the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy. Prof. Dr. Stefan Lechtenb\u00f6hmer points out: \"We have examined various options with thyssenkrupp Steel 2020 as to how CO2 savings can already be achieved in the short term within the framework of conventional blast furnace technology. The way to distribute the CO2 reductions achieved in real terms via a balance-sheet approach calculated on the product is feasible and makes sense. What is important here is that these are additional climate protection measures and that they are part of a comprehensive decarbonisation strategy for steel production.\u201d\nMarketing launch for steel with an allocated low CO2 intensity\nThe launch of the bluemint\u00ae product family also marks the start of active marketing measures for products with an allocated low CO2 intensity. Bernhard Osburg, CEO of thyssenkrupp Steel, explains: \u201dIt is important that we can provide our customers with products that contribute to real and measurable carbon dioxide reduction as quickly as can be. This is where we start. We are very happy to be supplying our products to Kaldewei, a company that is particularly committed to the idea of sustainability. We will now gradually expand the commercialization of our CO2-reduced bluemint\u00ae Steel range and have already commenced negotiations with a number of additional customers.\u201d\nFranz Kaldewei: \u201cbluemint\u00ae pure offers us the certainty of already being able to use the highest quality steel at a low carbon intensity for the production of our steel enamel bathroom solutions. This is an important step towards achieving our climate targets. With bluemint\u00aesteel from thyssenkrupp, we are clearing a major hurdle on the way to Kaldewei\u2019s climate-neutral orientation.\u201d\nT\u00dcV S\u00fcd approves use of scrap in blast furnaces\nA second, separate approach towards a CO2-reduced steel production has been taken by thyssenkrupp Steel by obtaining certification from T\u00dcV S\u00fcd in accordance with the VERIsteel procedure. This involves the use of scrap in the blast furnace process. This technological change will once again result in an absolute reduction of CO2 emissions at the Duisburg site. This is also achieved through a reduced coal consumption, since correspondingly less coal is needed for melting the scrap in the blast furnace. For each tonne of recycled product, a reduction in emission intensity from 2.1 tonnes to 0.75 tonnes of CO2 is achieved and accounted for on the balance sheet.\nSystematic implementation of the transformation strategy\nThe bluemint pure steel now being delivered are part of the comprehensive transformation strategy at thyssenkrupp Steel. The crucial milestone in the transformation of Europe\u2019s largest integrated steel mill towards climate neutrality will be the replacement of the conventional blast furnaces with hydrogen-fuelled direct reduction plants. The commissioning of the first large-scale plant including a melter is planned for 2025.\nIn the run-up to this technological leap, all possibilities are being exploited to noticeably reduce the CO2 emissions during production already with the existing blast-furnace-based technology. The use of HBI or scrap as carbon-reducing feedstock is the first step. In the future, thyssenkrupp Steel will also expand the use of hydrogen in the blast furnace and thus further increase the production of environmentally friendly steel. The world\u2019s first trials on the use of hydrogen started in Duisburg back in 2019 and have meanwhile been successfully accomplished. Christoph Dammermann, State Secretary at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Innovation, Digitalization and Energy, points out: \u201cThe Ruhr is predestined to become a model region for decarbonization. thyssenkrupp is sending a clear signal here with the first CO2-reduced steel produced in Duisburg. The NRW state government is accompanying the transformation, also here at the site, with practical funding projects, such as the world\u2019s first hydrogen trials in the blast furnace. We know that the leverage for CO2 reduction is particularly great in the steel industry. Thus, it is particularly important to harness this potential for efficient climate protection at the industrial level.\u201d","article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pressdetailpage\/bluemint-steel--thyssenkrupp-steel-launches-steel-with-an-allocated-low-co2-intensity-121712","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

And it also starts in Gelsenkirchen, at electrical steel specialist thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel. The company produces high-quality grain-oriented electrical steel, which is indispensable for the transmission and forwarding of electrical energy in low-loss power transformers. Now, for the first time, this basic material of the energy transition with significantly reduced CO2 intensity is being supplied to a customer. The first quantities of bluemint\u00ae Steel with 50 % lower CO2 emissions will be supplied to the Regensburg-based company SGB-SMIT for the production of transformers for new digital E.ON medium-voltage substations.\n  \nGelsenkirchen hidden champion back on track for success\nthyssenkrupp Electrical Steel is European market leader for grain-oriented electrical steel. This complex special material ensures that transformers operate at high efficiency to transport energy with as little loss as possible. The higher the grade of electrical steel, the higher the efficiency. Grain-oriented electrical steel of the powercore\u00ae brand from thyssenkrupp is used among other things in distribution and power transformers, but also in charging columns for electric cars and innovative electric motors.\nThe Gelsenkirchen-based company is back on track for success after a tight turnaround and performance program. Managing Director Georgios Giovanakis: \"We have made targeted investments and also brought additional engineering expertise into the workforce. The aim was and is to produce the technologically sophisticated top grades that are in particular demand on the market, which are characterized by particularly low core losses and thus achieve high efficiencies in current transport.\" The top grades of the powercore\u00ae brand enable customers to produce transformers which comply with the EU Ecodesign Directive and contribute to reducing global energy consumption and CO2 emissions. \"Through the technological turnaround in our three plants in Germany, France and India, we are supplying improved products to our customers, thus indirectly contributing to energy savings of more than one thousand gigawatt hours and thus to the avoidance of over 400,000 tons of CO2,\" adds Giovanakis. It is the clear goal of the Gelsenkirchen-based company to increase significantly the production of top grades with high efficiency. If low-CO2 power generation from renewable sources becomes predominant in the future, the share of CO2 emissions generated during the production phase of the transformer will come into even sharper focus. Therefore, the next logical step is now to offer electrical steel itself in reduced CO2 intensity.\n  \nTransformer manufacturer SGB-SMIT receives first quantities of CO2-reduced bluemint\u00ae Steel\nElectrical steel made in Gelsenkirchen is now available in CO2-reduced form for the first time. The first customer to receive bluemint\u00ae powercore with a 50 % lower CO2 intensity is transformer specialist SGB-SMIT from Regensburg. The company manufactures transformers that ensure the transport of electrical energy from the points of origin to the energy consumers. \"Energy suppliers and industrial companies all over the world rely on our products. It is great added value for us and our customers that thyssenkrupp's top grades are now also available in CO2-reduced form. This is an important step towards further decarbonization of the energy process chain,\" says Holger Ketterer, Managing Director of SGB-SMIT. The medium-sized company with a global customer base ordered bluemint\u00ae Steel from thyssenkrupp. This is used in power and distribution transformers. \"It's also clear that the more green energy is generated and transported, the greater the importance of a climate-friendly supply chain and the use of climate-friendly materials, including green steel,\" adds Ketterer.\nSince October 2021 thyssenkrupp Steel has been offering certified CO2-reduced steel under the bluemint\u00ae brand. Production will initially take place via the classic blast furnace route at the Duisburg site before the technological leap to hydrogen-based direct reduction technology from 2025.\nFor the batch now delivered to SGB-SMIT, reduced iron has already been used in the blast furnace, enabling a reduction in coal usage. This results in actual CO2 savings in the primary steel route, which are converted on balance to a specific quantity of certified bluemint\u00ae Steel - while maintaining the same high quality and full range of grades. Including all further processing steps in Duisburg and in Gelsenkirchen, a CO2 saving of 50 % per ton of bluemint\u00ae is achieved compared with conventional electrical steel. This means a reduction in the CO2 intensity of one ton of bluemint\u00ae powercore from 3.7 tons to 1.8 tons.\nThe Gelsenkirchen site is aiming for complete climate neutrality in the medium term, for example by using green electricity and biomethane in production as early as this year.\n  \nTransformers with CO2-reduced steel for new stations from E.ON\nThe energy company E.ON also sees great potential in the more climate-friendly version of its familiar and proven products. \"We are committed to a sustainable energy world of tomorrow - so it makes a big difference to the overall rating of a plant if also transformers with CO2-reduced electrical steel are used in a substation or station for green electricity,\" says Achim H\u00fcbner, International Category Lead for transformers at E.ON. The first small series is used by E.ON subsidiary Avacon. In the transport of electricity, transformers connect the individual voltage levels between power generation and the end consumer. The fact that this transport functions extremely efficiently and with low losses is also due to the materials from thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel. Highly efficient electrical steel, whether in wind turbines, generators or transformers, is an indispensable base material for the energy transition.\n\u201cClimate protection and the energy transition will be the predominant topics of the next decades\u201d, says Giovanakis. \"With its products thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel is helping to achieve the climate targets. This spurs us on even more to further improve our products for the energy transition.\"","article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pressdetailpage\/co2-reduced-electrical-steel-from-thyssenkrupp-as-a-sustainable-base-material-for-the-energy-turnaround--thyssenkrupp-electrical-steel-supplies-transformer-specialist-sgb-smit-with-electrical-steel-for-eons-new-digital-stations-126279","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","label":null,"carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1}

Why? Because even with the sole use of renewable energies, the raw materials used in cement production result in CO2 being released and emitted to the atmosphere. thyssenkrupp Uhde, Holcim and the Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin have therefore partnered up in a joint project to investigate the use of a novel amine scrubbing technology for carbon capture. The goal is to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from existing cement plants and at the same time utilize the captured CO2 for other applications. In concrete terms, this includes the development of new mass transfer process equipment that is more efficient and resilient to contaminations. The project is being funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action under the funding number 03EE5103A.\nDr. Ralph Kleinschmidt, Head of Technology, Innovation and Sustainability at thyssenkrupp Uhde: \"Amine scrubbing is already commonly used to recover CO2 from process gases or exhaust gases. Now, we are developing the technology further and optimizing it for the cement industry. Additional applications for capturing CO2 direct at source, such as in waste incineration plants, are also possible.\"\nArne Stecher, Head of Decarbonization at Holcim Germany: \"Carbon capture will be a must for cement plants in the near future. That is why we are testing different processes to find the best carbon capture technology. Carbon capture by means of amine scrubbing is a promising solution. I am pleased that, together with our partners, we can test the use of this innovative process in the cement industry.\u201d\nProf. Dr.-Ing. Jens-Uwe Repke, Chair of Process Dynamics and Operations Group at TU Berlin: \"Developing innovative carbon capture technology for gas treating and improving the efficiency, environmental compatibility, and sustainability of existing carbon capture processes, as well as putting them into practice, is an urgent and crucial task that makes a direct contribution to climate protection. These goals can only be achieved if industry cooperates closely with research facilities like universities.\"\nThe performance and efficiency of this equipment is being tested using real exhaust gas at the cement plant located in Beckum, Germany. This is paving the way for commercial use. Various possibilities for using the captured CO2 are also being examined, for example methanol or sustainable fuels. With this process, the partners are seeking to make a contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gases, especially in existing cement production plants. These can then be retrofitted with equipment for capturing CO2 from the process gas without further adapting the production process.\nAbout thyssenkrupp Uhde:\nthyssenkrupp Uhde combines unique technological expertise and decades of global experience in the engineering, procurement, construction and service of chemical plants. We develop innovative processes and products for a more sustainable future and thus contribute to the long-term success of our customers in almost all areas of the chemical industry.
