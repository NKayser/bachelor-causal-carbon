Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “ArcelorMittal’s generally excellent performance in 2008 was overshadowed by the considerable slowdown in the world economy in the last quarter of the year. Our scale, strength and market leadership, however, allowed us to swiftly and decisively implement a number of operational and financial measures to adapt to the changing environment. These measures have already started to yield results. The reduction of net debt is particularly pleasing, enabled by our ability to continue to generate strong free cash flow.

However, he will continue with ArcelorMittal in an advisory capacity, so that the company's Brazilian operations will continue to benefit from his skills and experience.  Mr. Campos began his tenure with the organization in 1992, leaving the Brazilian mining firm CVRD to join Companhia Siderúrgica de Tubarão (CST) as it was being privatized. He became President and CEO of CST in 1997. He has held the same positions at ArcelorMittal Brasil since its formation – through the integration of CST, Vega do Sul, and BelgoMineira – in 2005. He has been a member of the Brazilian Steel Institute (IBS) and was its President from 2002 to 2005. He has also been a member of the Brazilian Metallurgy and Materials Society since 1972 and is on the Board of Directors of the Brazilian Business Council for Sustainable Development (CEBDS).  Benjamin Baptista, who has been appointed to the position of Vice President and CEO, Flat Carbon South America (FCSA), will succeed José Armando Campos.  Mr. Baptista currently serves as Vice President, Commercial for FCSA. An engineer, he has had a broad range of executive experience since joining the company in 1983, including extensive project and operational responsibilities. His knowledge and experience managing commercial coordination and critical customer relationships for FCSA will contribute substantially to the realization of ArcelorMittal's strategic growth objectives in this important region.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, Chief Financial Officer and member of ArcelorMittal's Group Management Board responsible for Flat Carbon Americas said:  \"José Armando has provided exceptional service to ArcelorMittal and to the employees of FCSA. Based in large part on his personal integrity and commitment to people development, FCSA has become one of the most well respected operations in our Group as well as in the entire Brazilian economy. His leadership during the integration of Arcelor and Mittal was invaluable, and we are pleased that our Brazilian operations will continue to benefit from his counsel. We are also very confident and excited that Benjamin will provide the executive leadership and vision required to carry FCSA through this challenging economic period and on to the next generation of success for ArcelorMittal's operations in the region.\"","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2009-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Announces Leadership Transition for Flat Carbon South America Operations","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announces that as part of his original retirement plan, José Armando Campos has stepped down.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-announces-leadership-transition\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

The company will maintain all equipment during the suspension period to ensure that production can be re-started as swiftly as possible when market conditions improve.  The EWC and ArcelorMittal agreed that there will now be strong and transparent social dialogue about the production suspensions at local site level with the relevant Works Councils and employees.  Commenting, Bernard Fontana, Executive Vice President and Management Committee Member of ArcelorMittal with responsibility for Human Resources, said: \"We had a constructive meeting today with the European Works Council and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their co-operation during what is a very challenging period for the global economy. The steel industry, like many global companies, is suffering the very real repercussions of the global economic slowdown. We have moved swiftly to adapt ourselves to the new economic reality but despite the good progress made market conditions remain harsh. It is therefore only sensible to continue with our plans to suspend and optimize production at our sites on a temporary basis, until we are confident that real demand is beginning to improve. Our primary goal is to proceed in a socially responsible way with respect for those affected. These decisions are not taken lightly, but by taking the right initiatives now we are protecting the company and its employees for the longer term.\"  Jacques Laplanche, Secretary of the European Works Council, added: \"It is essential to deal with this exceptional economic environment by having a strong and consistent social dialogue at all levels including EMF, EWC, countries and sites and to ensure that all affected sites are well maintained to safeguard ArcelorMittal's production capability in Europe\".","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2009-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Joint statement from ArcelorMittal and its European Works Council regarding meeting held today in Luxembourg","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal met today with its European Works Council to provide an update on the temporary suspension of production at sites in Europe.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/joint-statement-from-arcelormittal-and-its-european-works\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

In connection with the offering, the Company intends to grant the underwriters a 30 day option to purchase up to an additional $75 million of convertible senior notes.

Total aggregate proceeds from the offerings are approximately $3.5 billion (exclusive of any proceeds attributable to the underwriters' possible exercise of their over-allotment options described below) or $4 billion (assuming full exercise of those options), in each case before deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions.  The Company has agreed to sell 125,143,915 common shares at a public offering price of 17.10 EUR (US$22.77 at a $\/EUR conversion rate of 1.3318) per common share. In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 15,738,719 common shares in the 30 day period following the date hereof.

Interest on the convertible senior notes will be paid semi-annually at a rate of 5 percent per year, and the convertible senior notes will mature on May 15, 2014, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The convertible senior notes will be convertible at the holder's option into shares of ArcelorMittal common stock (or, at the option of ArcelorMittal, into cash or a combination of cash or common stock) at an initial conversion ratio of 33.1675 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $30.15 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. This initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 32.4 percent relative to the public offering price of ArcelorMittal's common stock of 17.10 EUR (US$22.77 at a $\/EUR conversion rate of 1.3318) per share in the common stock offering.

{"id":6032,"text":"ArcelorMittal is working on advanced technologies to redefine the steel making process and contribute positively to the global challenge of climate change. It is using its expertise in steel to find ways to operate more efficiently, to develop pioneering new processes and more sustainable practices, and to work in partnership with its customers and suppliers to help them achieve their environmental goals.  Some of ArcelorMittal's operations are already outstanding examples of industry leading best practice in social and environmental performance. Indeed some, like those in Brazil, have a long and proud track record in this area, and are regularly cited as role models for others. Likewise, its plants in Europe and the US have set the pace for the whole steel industry in carbon emission reductions. Reaching these high standards across the business is a priority for ArcelorMittal.  Other highlights in this year's report include:    * Communities – Habitat for Humanity: In 2008, the ArcelorMittal Foundation set up a partnership with Habitat for Humanity that involved financial support, volunteering opportunities for our employees and a design scheme to use our expertise in steel construction to develop new, sustainable, low-cost approaches to building family homes. The first steel frame homes are being constructed in Romania, using light steel frames designed by our R&D team in Liege, Belgium. The goal is to build more durable homes using steel frames and roofing in countries that are prone to natural disasters, as well as training communities to adopt safer construction practices.    * South Africa Schools: Formed a partnership with the South African Department of Education to build ten schools throughout the country using new steel technology. The first school, Mamelodi Primary, is scheduled for completion by the end of 2009. This investment not only ensures that we have a pool of skilled resources for our own operations, but also contributes towards addressing the skills shortage in the country in general.    * Workplace:   * $20 million dollars invested by ArcelorMittal University in training programmes for employees   * 17,751 participants from 23 countries in its academies and induction programmes, representing almost 40,000 training days   * Group lost time injury frequency rate was reduced to 2.3 per million hours worked (from 3.3 in 2007).","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2009-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal releases 2008 Corporate Responsibility Report \"How will we achieve Safe Sustainable Steel?\"","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal is pleased to announce the publication of its 'Corporate Responsibility Report 2008: How will we achieve safe sustainable steel?'

Through a series of video episodes and a blog section, the season looks at how the company was affected by the unexpected economic crisis, how it adapted to this unprecedented shock and how as the recovery progresses the focus it puts on maintaining its leadership position.  Exploring the values and its commitment to its stakeholders, the Web TV takes a transparent approach to tell the story of the global economic downturn and its consequences on the business.  The new season starts with an episode that encapsulates the essence of the last 18 months, from the sudden downturn to the realization of what this meant for the company. With insightful and personal reflections from members of the senior management including the Chairman and CEO, Lakshmi Mittal, as well as from shop floor employees, the first episode highlights the various ways that the company was affected and the challenges it faced.  Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, said: \"2009 was a very difficult year for us as well as for many other companies. In order to adapt to a very challenging environment we had to look hard at how the company operated and make whatever changes were necessary in order to be resilient in the face of the worst economic downturn since the Second World War. Whilst we would all have preferred not to have lived through that period, nevertheless the business has learned some valuable lessons which will make us a stronger company in the long-term. The Web TV is a perfect platform to explore and explain this by sharing our experiences in a very transparent way with all our stakeholders.\"  Nicola Davidson, Vice President Corporate Communications, said: \"People often focus on the financial impact that an economic crisis has on a company, but there are many other aspects of the company that can be affected, for example relationships with customers and suppliers, and the motivation and morale of employees. We wanted to utilize the Web TV to examine all these aspects in closer detail, as well as exploring the decisions that helped us through the crisis, such as cost competitiveness, and the projects and opportunities that will lead us back to growth and maintain our competitive edge.\"  Launched in 2007, the two previous award winning series had pioneered the concept of Web TVs and given stakeholders a transparent view inside ArcelorMittal. With almost 3 million unique visitors in the two previous seasons, the ArcelorMittal Web TV has become an essential tool in the group's internal and external communication.  In parallel to the episodes, the site has been developed as a rich community-oriented space where visitors are encouraged to get involved with the content, react to the stories, and take active part in '2010: The Road to Recovery'.

With operations in 60 countries and over 250,000 employees around the world, ArcelorMittal is perfectly positioned to become a sponsor of the world's greatest international sporting event.  Speaking at today's unveiling of The ArcelorMittal Orbit at London's City Hall, Lakshmi Mittal, in the presence of Mayor Boris Johnson and Anish Kapoor, revealed the design chosen to act as an iconic and permanent symbol of the 2012 games. Moreover, it will embody both the artistic and functional versatility of steel as a construction material.  Lakshmi Mittal commented: \"The Olympic Games are one of the few truly iconic global events. I was immediately excited by the prospect of ArcelorMittal becoming involved because ArcelorMittal is a global company with operations in more than 60 countries. And as someone who lives in this great city, I remember the great excitement felt when it was announced that London had been selected to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. We set out to create a transformational piece of art that will be an iconic symbol for the Olympics and also a new landmark that will endure long after the Games themselves. Everyone at ArcelorMittal is delighted with the outcome of the ArcelorMittal Orbit. London will have a bold, beautiful and magnificent sculpture that also showcases the great versatility of steel.\"  ArcelorMittal, led by Chairman and CEO Lakshmi Mittal, will fund £16 million of the £19.1 million project, with the outstanding £3.1 million provided by the London Development Agency. As such, the sculpture not only represents a significant cultural investment – the largest single artwork ever commissioned for any Olympiad – but will also make a significant financial contribution to the long-term regeneration of East London.  The ArcelorMittal Orbit, the largest artistic commission in the world, will harness state-of-the-art engineering and architectural techniques. Constructed with steel provided by ArcelorMittal, the sculpture will consist of a continuous looping lattice of tubular steel and offer unparalleled view of the entire Olympic Park and London's skyline from a special viewing platform.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2010-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal confirmed as sponsor for London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"The Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal, today unveiled the artist and design chosen to create a spectacular new visitor attraction in the Olympic Park.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-confirmed-as-sponsor-for-london-2012\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

While Baffinland considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may prove to be incorrect. Forward looking-information is subject to certain factors, including risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is currently expected. These factors include risks inherent in the exploration for and development of mineral deposits, risks relating to changes in iron ore prices and changes in the worldwide demand for and supply of iron ore, uncertainties inherent in the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, risks relating to the remoteness of the Mary River Property including access and supply risks, reliance on key personnel, construction and operational risks inherent in the conduct of mining activities, regulatory risks, including risks relating to the acquisition of necessary licenses and permits, financing, capitalization and liquidity risks, including the risk that the financing required to fund all currently planned exploration and related activities may not be available on satisfactory terms, or at all, environmental risks and insurance risks. You should not place undue importance on forward-looking information and should not rely upon this information as of any other date.

{"id":6075,"text":"Based on this assessment, the Board has decided to proceed with the spin-off of the stainless steel business which it believes will maximise value for shareholders. Subject to shareholder approval, shares in the stainless steel business will be distributed to shareholders in the first quarter of 2011. Shareholders will receive one stainless steel business share for every twenty ArcelorMittal shares held on the record date. Stainless steel business shares will be listed on Euronext Paris, Amsterdam and in Luxembourg. In the United States, they will trade on the over-the-counter market in the form of NY Registry Shares. A prospectus describing the stainless steel business and transaction will be published later this month.  The spinoff is expected to result in a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $ 800 million as the stainless steel business will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 applicable to assets held for distribution. The final impairment charge will be assessed by ArcelorMittal and reviewed by its auditors as at year end. Currency fluctuations and change in working capital are the main factors that between now and year end may influence the final impairment amount. No such impairment charge would be expected had the stainless steel segment remained in the scope of activities of ArcelorMittal.  Following the spin-off, the stainless steel business will have approximately $1bn of net financial debt which will comprise a combination of existing ArcelorMittal debt transferring with the stainless steel business and new debt raised by this business. As a result, the transaction is expected to be broadly neutral to ArcelorMittal's net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio.

{"id":6081,"text":"The ArcelorMittal Offer is made for 100% of Baffinland's shares as compared to Nunavut's offer, which is a coercive partial bid for only 50.1% of Baffinland's common shares including those shares already owned by Nunavut.  The current offer by Nunavut is coercive because it forces Baffinland shareholders to decide whether to accept or reject such offer without knowing the price at which the shares not taken up would trade should the current offer by Nunavut be completed. Nunavut's offer leaves shareholders with the prospect of being left with thinly traded minority common shares that would unlikely reflect the full value of Baffinland's assets. In addition, Nunavut's offer provides Baffinland's shareholders with no certainty as to how many shares will be taken-up due to the pro rationing of tendered shares. Further, the fact that Nunavut already owns approximately 10.3% of the common shares means it is effectively bidding for only approximately 39.8%.  Assuming all of Baffinland's common shares, other than those locked-up with ArcelorMittal and those owned by Nunavut, are tendered to Nunavut's offer, Baffinland's shareholders would receive C$1.35 in cash for approximately 62% of their holdings and would end up continuing to hold the remaining 38% of their tendered shares. For Baffinland shareholders to realize the equivalent value offered by the C$1.25 ArcelorMittal Offer, the remaining minority common shares held by tendering shareholders would have to trade at or above C$1.09 per share, versus an unaffected price for Baffinland's common shares of C$0.56 prior to the initial unsolicited offer by Nunavut on 22 September 2010. The economic value of the coercive partial offer by Nunavut is substantially less than the ArcelorMittal Offer and is highly uncertain as it is dependent on an unspecified royalty structure and project development plan.  Under the current offer by Nunavut, Baffinland shareholders face continued execution and financing risk with the potential for significant equity dilution. If the Nunavut offer were successful, these risks could materially and adversely affect the value of the remaining minority common shares.  Baffinland has agreed to adopt a new shareholder rights plan in order to protect Baffinland's shareholders from being coerced into tendering into Nunavut's inferior partial offer and in order to guard against tactics by Nunavut that seek to coerce shareholders. Adopting a new rights plan ensures that Baffinland shareholders can take advantage of the superior ArcelorMittal Offer.  The increased break fee payable under the ArcelorMittal Offer reflects Baffinland's board of directors' support for the certainty and value that the ArcelorMittal Offer provides to Baffinland shareholders. ArcelorMittal's Offer for all common shares represents an increase of $0.15 per share, or almost $60 million, more than its original bid.  ArcelorMittal has received all of the required regulatory approvals for its offer and is uniquely positioned to provide the technical expertise and financial capacity to evaluate, manage and overcome the infrastructure challenges associated with the Mary River project, a project vital to Baffinland's future success.

{"id":6082,"text":"In light of this, the OSC had requested that ArcelorMittal and Nunavut extend their bids until mid January pending such hearing. Given that ArcelorMittal is not prepared to hold its offer open beyond December 29, ArcelorMittal has requested, in accordance with the Support Agreement between ArcelorMittal and Baffinland, that Baffinland waive the Rights Plan by no later than 4:59 p.m. (Toronto time) on December 29, 2010. Unless waived with respect to all bids prior to that time by Baffinland, the OSC has ordered that the Rights Plan be cease traded at 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on December 29, 2010. Accordingly, the expiry time of ArcelorMittal's offer remains 11:59 pm (Toronto time) on December 29, 2010.  ArcelorMittal's offer for 100% of Baffinland's shares is clearly superior to Nunavut's coercive partial offer for less than half of Baffinland's outstanding shares. Therefore, ArcelorMittal believes that its bid will be successful on December 29, 2010 and has no intention of extending its offer beyond that date.  Shareholders should be aware that if ArcelorMittal's minimum tender condition is not met and its offer expires, the Support Agreement between ArcelorMittal and Baffinland would be terminated and Resource Capital Funds (RCF) would then be released from its Lock-Up Agreement with ArcelorMittal, leaving RCF free to tender to Nunavut's partial offer. In such case, if all outstanding Baffinland shares were to be tendered to Nunavut's offer, the pro rata take-up under that offer would be reduced from 62% to 44% of shares tendered and Baffinland's remaining minority shares would need to trade at $1.17 per share after completion of that offer in order for the value of Nunavut's offer to equal the $1.25 value of ArcelorMittal's offer for all outstanding shares, more than double the $0.56 per share unaffected price of Baffinland's shares prior to the announcement of Nunavut's unsolicited offer in September 2010.  ArcelorMittal has received all required regulatory approvals for its offer and is in a position to take up all shares tendered if its 50% plus one common share minimum tender condition is met on December 29, 2010. ArcelorMittal has improved its offer by almost $60 million since its original offer on November 12, 2010, whereas Nunavut's current partial offer provides $83 million less cash to Baffinland shareholders than Nunavut's original $0.80 per share offer.

{"id":6085,"text":"This re-affirmation follows a settlement agreement between Nunavut and Staff of the Ontario Securities Commission (\"OSC\"), the major terms of which were that Nunavut must either extend the expiry date of its bid for a minimum of 10 days without offering the exchange rights and warrants previously proposed by Nunavut, or amend their offer to provide for the issuance of the exchange rights while also extending the offer for a minimum 10 days. Under no circumstances can Nunavut on January 10, 2011 take up any shares tendered to its offer.  Nunavut's agreement with the OSC allowed it to avoid a public hearing to examine the adequacy of its disclosure and its compliance with securities laws, and the risk of a cease trade order against its bid.  \"Nunavut's partial offer is highly conditional and discretionary, and continues to be so,\" Peter Kukielski, Head of Mining and Member of the Group Management Board at ArcelorMittal, said. \"Nunavut provides Baffinland shareholders no certainty as to what Nunavut is offering under its bid. Nunavut's coercive partial offer will leave shareholders with the prospect of holding thinly traded shares subject to further financing and execution risks. It is also important for Baffinland shareholders to understand that the Nunavut offer does not currently include any exchange rights or warrants, and will not unless and until such time as the Nunavut offer is amended and the timing extended, both of which are uncertain.\"  He added that the Baffinland shares would be subject to further dilution under the Nunavut offer, as a result of the proposed issuance of warrants, if implemented, and as Nunavut sought financing to move the project forward\".  As disclosed by Baffinland earlier today, estimated capital costs under the Road Haulage feasibility study currently being finalized are expected to be higher than research analyst estimates, creating further uncertainty about the likely trading value of Baffinland shares not taken up under the Nunavut partial offer.  From the perspective of Baffinland shareholders, the ArcelorMittal offer for 100% of Baffinland shares eliminates all uncertainty with respect to future financing and costs of the Mary River project, dilution arising from the financing of the project, and the future trading value of Baffinland shares.

{"id":6108,"text":"World's leading steel company reiterates commitment to energy-efficiency and safety and wellbeing in the workplace and beyond as economic recovery gathers pace  Issued as part of the company's Annual General Meeting at its Luxembourg headquarters, this report underlines ArcelorMittal's commitment to improving its safety and sustainability performance in line with growing product demand from the recovering global economy. The report has been externally assured by Bureau Veritas and adheres to the Global Reporting Initiative G3 guidelines and United Nations Global Compact principles.  Key highlights of this year's CR report include the launch of a dedicated Human Rights Policy, which is implemented across its operations as well as through its supply chain.  ArcelorMittal's investments in energy-saving and environmental projects in 2010 increased to $347 million, from $224 million the previous year. Furthermore, ArcelorMittal's commitment to research and development, spending $322 million in 2010, is helping it to reach its goal of reducing emissions by 8% or 170kg per tonne of steel produced by 2020, against a 2007 baseline.  ArcelorMittal's health and safety performance also improved, with the Group's Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) falling from 1.9 per million hours worked in 2009 to 1.8 per million hours in 2010. Moving forward, the company is firmly committed to its 'Journey to Zero', and has set a new ambitious Group-wide target to reduce LTIFR to 1.0 per million hours worked by 2013.  Other key Corporate Responsibility highlights for the 2010 financial year included the following:    * Supply chain: In 2010, ArcelorMittal published its Code for Responsible Sourcing, which sets out the minimum environmental and social standards its suppliers must meet, and how the company will work actively with them to achieve this.   * ArcelorMittal University: Training at the ArcelorMittal University increased by 28% to over 403,000 hours.   * Community investment: The ArcelorMittal Foundation invested $37.7 million across more than 585 local community projects in 2010. This included a $1 million donation in cash and in kind to support the earthquake relief work in Haiti, offering assistance in new housing projects.   * Anti-corruption training: 94 per cent of employees in relevant roles were trained on ArcelorMittal's new anti-corruption guidelines in 2010.   * Community engagement: In addition to adhering to ArcelorMittal's Community Engagement Standard, many units have begun to produce local corporate responsibility reports to strengthen disclosure with stakeholders, this includes Argentina, Brazil, India, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the USA.   * External recognition: ArcelorMittal has been a member of the FTSE4Good index since 2007 and in 2010 the company was accepted into the Dow Jones Sustainability World and Europe indices, evidencing the progress made in areas of governance, social and environmental management. It was also named as a SAM &#xu2;018Sector Mover' – an award given to the company that achieved the biggest proportional improvement in its sustainability performance compared with the previous year.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2011-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes 2010 Corporate Responsibility Report: Safe Sustainable Steel","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal, the world's leading steel company, today published its Corporate Responsibility (CR) report for the 2010 financial year: Safe Sustainable Steel.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-publishes-2010-corporate-responsibility\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6123,"text":"ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel and mining company, today commenced commercial iron ore production from its mining operations in Liberia. A launch event was held in Buchanan which was attended by Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Minister of Lands, Mines and Energy, Mr. Roosevelt G. Jayjay, Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, as well as ArcelorMittal's senior management team.  The launch of commercial mining operations represents an important milestone in the recovery of Liberia's economy, which was devastated by 14 years of civil war.ArcelorMittal first entered this market in 2005, realising the potential of the country's rich mineral resources to facilitate repair of the country's industrial and social infrastructure.  Working in partnership with the Liberian government and civil society, ArcelorMittal has demonstrated how the needs of industry can be reconciled with those of a developing economy, delivering mutual benefit to all stakeholders. From the outset, the company has focused on creating a sustainable operation that can ultimately be run by Liberian nationals, ensuring maximum employment opportunities for local citizens.  \"It gives me great pleasure to announce the formal launch of our mining operations in Liberia,\" comments Lakshmi N. Mittal.\"Quite apart from the significant impact this will have on the local economy, I'm also proud that our approach to this exciting new market represents best practice in terms of responsible business.\"  Developing a sustainable mining operation in Liberia has necessitated finding solutions to a number of challenges. To date, ArcelorMittal invested 800 million USD in repairing roads and infrastructure, whilst also supporting the need for education and healthcare amongst the local population, through projects including the reconstruction of a 240 km railway, port, hospital and school facilities – developments that will serve local communities as well as enabling the iron ore mining operation to operate efficiently. By 2012, ArcelorMittal aims to ship four million tonnes of iron ore from Liberia each year. A first test shipment successfully took place last week.  Another key element of the company's investment in Liberia was the launch, in January 2010, of the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Forum.Created in partnership with the German international development body Deutsche Gesellschaft Fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the role of the CR Forum is to promote effective corporate citizenship and good business practice amongst both domestic Liberian companies and other multinationals planning to invest in the country. The creation of this body, which is also chaired by ArcelorMittal, has received credit from campaign groups including the UK-based corporate watchdog Global Witness, underlining the credibility and transparency of the company's strategy.  As part of its wider commitment to minimising the industry's environmental impact, ArcelorMittal also commissioned a team of local and international experts and NGOs to conduct a full biodiversity study in Liberia's Nimba mountain range. It has been the most comprehensive environmental study ever undertaken in Liberia, ensuring that iron ore mining operations do not come at an unacceptable cost to the local ecosystem.  ArcelorMittal also became a member of Multi-Stakeholders Steering Group of the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2009, having supported this initiative since 2007.  Attending the launch ceremony for ArcelorMittal's mining operation, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf commented:\"ArcelorMittal was one of the first major companies to enter Liberia after decades of instability. Their coming – for which Liberians will always be grateful – signalled a major vote of confidence by investors in the leadership and future of our country. ArcelorMittal honored its 2006 commitment to launch mining operations by the third quarter of 2011. This is a promise the company has kept, despite the global financial crisis that threatened to bring the project to a halt. ArcelorMittal's work has improved the lives of many Liberians today and for many years to come. We welcome this excellent partnership. We look forward to an even brighter and prosperous future for ArcelorMittal and for Liberia.\"    * For further information on our operations in Liberia and live updates please visit: http:\/\/allafrica.com\/infocenter\/ArcelorMittal\/news-and-media\/press-releases\/   * For high resolution images of our Liberia operations please click here","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2011-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal formally commences iron ore production in Liberia","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Important milestone in Liberia's economic recovery achieved","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-formally-commences-iron-ore-production\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6128,"text":"ArcelorMittal will remain a shareholder in PEAMCoal until the termination arrangements are completed which is expected to be in approximately 90 days' time. In taking this decision, ArcelorMittal has determined that it would no longer be appropriate to allocate substantial capital to the acquisition of a non-controlling, minority business interest. This is in accordance with the rights that ArcelorMittal originally negotiated with Peabody at the time the Co-operation and Contribution Agreement was concluded.  Given the unanticipated level of acceptances into the offer, ArcelorMittal believes that it is more appropriate to focus its capital elsewhere in its business.

{"id":6131,"text":"The increased all cash offer represents a premium of approximately 27% to ArcelorMittal's original Offer price of C$1.10 per Common Share, and a premium of 150% to the trading price of the Common Shares prior to Nunavut's original unsolicited offer in September 2010.  Peter Kukielski, Head of Mining and Member of the Group Management Board of ArcelorMittal said: \"ArcelorMittal's increased Offer of C$1.40 per share for all Common Shares provides demonstrably superior value and certainty for Baffinland shareholders, compared to Nunavut Iron Ore Acquisition Inc.'s revised coercive partial offer. Our Offer ensures shareholders receive 100% cash for all of their shares, rather than cash for just some shares and diluted value for the shares not taken up under the Nunavut offer.\"  If Nunavut Iron Ore Acquisition Inc.'s (\"Nunavut\") revised offer were successful, Baffinland shareholders would face the prospect of being left with thinly traded minority Common Shares that would be unlikely to reflect the full value of Baffinland's assets. Furthermore, if Nunavut's partial offer was successful and Baffinland were to issue the approximately 157.4 million warrants contemplated in their partial offer, a substantial overhang would exist, which would lead to significant equity dilution, both of which would likely have a negative impact on the trading value of the remaining minority held Common Shares of Baffinland.  Since Nunavut already owns approximately 10.5% of the Common Shares, it is effectively bidding for only approximately 49.5%, or approximately 55.4% of the 89.5% of Common Shares it does not currently own.  In order for the value of Nunavut's revised coercive partial offer to equal the C$1.40 per Common Share offered by ArcelorMittal's increased Offer (assuming a 55.4% pro rata take-up under Nunavut's offer), the remaining minority held Common Shares would need to trade at C$1.18 per share (which assumes a warrant value of C$0.23 per full warrant using Nunavut's volatility and risk free rate assumptions as set out in its December 29 announcement), which is more than double the C$0.56 trading value of the Common Shares prior to Nunavut's original offer for all of the Common Shares in September 2010. Assuming Common Shares tendered to the Offer under lock-up agreements with ArcelorMittal do not tender and there is a 76.6% take-up under the Nunavut revised coercive partial offer, the remaining minority held Common Shares would need to trade at C$1.06 per share for the value of Nunavut's revised coercive partial offer to equal the C$1.40 per Common Share offered by ArcelorMittal's increased Offer.  Nunavut's revised coercive partial offer leaves Baffinland shareholders uncertain about:    * How many of their shares will be taken-up due to the pro rationing of tendered shares;    * the price at which shares not taken up by Nunavut would trade should the current partial offer by Nunavut be completed;   * the timing of any amendment to its offer to provide for exchange rights;   * whether warrants would be issued in the future and the value such warrants represent; and   * Nunavut's project development plan for Baffinland.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2011-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Increases Its Offer Price for all Common Shares of Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation to C$1.40 per Common Share","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announced that it has increased its offer (the \"Offer\") for all outstanding common shares (\"Common Shares\") of Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation (\"Baffinland\") and all outstanding common share purchase warrants issued pursuant to a warrant indenture dated 31 January 2007 (the \"2007 Warrants\") to C$1.40 per Common Share.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-increases-its-offer-price-for-all-common\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6136,"text":"Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “The progressive recovery that we have been experiencing was impacted in the second half of the year by the growing uncertainty over the economic situation in Europe, which particularly affected sentiment and performance in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, against this backdrop ArcelorMittal delivered an improved underlying performance compared with 2010 and met our expectation of a higher EBITDA in the second half compared with the previous year. The Company continues to benefit from its diverse geographic presence and growing mining business, which delivered on its targets to increase iron-ore and coal production by 10% and 20% respectively. I must also remark on our health and safety performance, which showed an improvement in the injury frequency rate to 1.2x in the fourth quarter.  Looking ahead to 2012, the situation in Europe remains a live concern. Despite the continued uncertainty in this market, however, we are seeing an improvement in sentiment compared with the fourth quarter. Steel shipment volumes for the first six months are expected to be similar to the first half of 2011 and we are again targeting increased production from our mining business.”  ### Fourth quarter 2011 earnings analyst conference call  Additionally, ArcelorMittal management will host a conference call for members of the investment community to discuss the fourth quarter 2011 financial performance at:  ###   Date | New York | London | Luxembourg   ---|---|---|---   Tuesday February 7, 2012 | 9.30am | 2.30pm | 3.30pm   The dial in numbers: |  |    Location | Dial in numbers | Replay numbers | Participant   UK local: | +44 (0)207 970 0006 | +44 (0)20 7111 1244 | 696578#   UK toll free | 0800 169 3059 |  | 696578#   USA local: | +1 215 599 1757 | +1 347 366 9565 | 696578#   USA free phone: | 1800 814 6417 |  | 696578#   A replay of the conference call will be available for one week by dialing   Language | English   +49 (0) 1805 2043 089 | Access code | 421168# |       The conference call will include a brief question and answer session with senior management.

{"id":6149,"text":"“ArcelorMittal’s status as the world’s leading steel and mining company is a source of intense pride, both personally and for our employees,” comments Lakshmi N. Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal. “With industry leadership comes responsibility, however – responsibility to our employees and contractors; to our shareholders and customers; to the environment; and, not least, to the communities in which we operate. I hope the 2011 CR Report demonstrates that we are delivering against this responsibility by making tangible progress against key targets, particularly in the all-important area of health and safety,” he adds.   Other key elements of ArcelorMittal’s CR performance in 2011 include commissioning Deloitte to provide assurance over the report and conduct the first-ever external verification of the Group’s CO2 footprint, providing a benchmark against which to measure emissions performance in future years. 98 per cent of the company’s steel operations have now been certified against the ISO 14001 international standard for environmental management systems, up from 95 per cent in 2010.  This year also saw ArcelorMittal’s CR reporting improve to level B+ in the application of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3.1 guidelines, due to increased disclosures.   2011 is also the year that ArcelorMittal Orbit rose from the ground at the heart of the London 2012 Olympic Park. This striking 114.5 metre ‘living sculpture’ that will be formally unveiled this week, is a demonstration of the strength and versatility of steel. The steel is sourced from ArcelorMittal plants from around the world with 57 per cent coming from recycled sources. Steel is the world’s most recycled and recyclable material and, as the world’s largest steel producer, in 2011 ArcelorMittal saved approximately 40 million tonnes of CO2 through the re-use of more than 30 million tonnes of scrap.

The joint venture is expected to become operational in the first half of 2014.  In addition ArcelorMittal could potentially recalibrate its share-holding in Hunan Valin Steel. The two companies have finalized a share swap arrangement based upon a Put Option mechanism, which enables ArcelorMittal to exercise the Put Options granted by Valin Group over the next two years. Under this arrangement, ArcelorMittal could sell up to 19.9% of the equity (600 million shares) it holds in Hunan Valin Steel to Valin Group. The exercise period of the Put Options is equally spaced with a gap of 6 months and linked to the key development milestones of VAMA. Following the exercise of the Put Options, ArcelorMittal would retain a 10.07% shareholding in Valin Steel as a long term strategic cooperation.  Mr Sudhir Maheshwari, ArcelorMittal’s Group Management Board member responsible for China, said: “We have agreed with Valin Group to recalibrate our shareholdings in Valin Steel to focus on China’s fast growing automotive steel market.

{"id":6156,"text":"The segment recorded an operating loss of €340 million which includes restructuring costs but excludes interest and tax costs. This follows a loss of €499 million in the second half of 2011 reflecting the continued difficult operating environment in Europe.       Compared to the same period of 2011, the segment’s crude steel production fell 8% from 15,501 Mt to 14,325 Mt as output was adjusted to weak demand levels.      Steel shipments for Q2 2012 fell to 6,771 Mt, a decrease of 9.2% as compared to 7,461 Mt for 1Q 2012. This was due to lower demand in Europe, following the end of restocking, as well as lower exports.      Sales were €5,634 million for 2Q 2012, a decrease of 4.3% as compared to €5,887 million for 1Q 2012. Sales decreased primarily due to lower steel shipment volumes offset in part by higher average steel selling prices (+4.8%).      Capital expenditure in the segment in the first half of 2012 was €375 million, slightly higher than the €356 million spent in the same period of the previous year.  Steel demand in the developed world has been impacted globally as a result of the severe problems experienced in the economy since the onset of the financial crisis at the end of 2008. Developed world demand remains far below its peak, at only 410 million tonnes in 2011 compared with 492 million tonnes in 2007.

{"id":6160,"text":"\\- Commits to maintain and invest in high-quality finishing operations   \\- Accepts request from the French government to find a buyer for the liquid phase  Given the continued economic difficulties affecting the French and European economies, the company wishes to propose to permanently close the liquid phase and concentrate efforts and investment on the high-quality finishing operation, which employs more than 2,000 employees.  To date the company had implemented a strategy of temporary idling the Florange furnaces whilst waiting to see if the economic situation would improve. However after four years of challenging conditions, it is clear that there will be no swift return to pre-crisis levels. Today European demand is still approximately 25% below 2007 levels.  This proposal has not been made lightly but it is a reality that the Florange liquid phase and the slab it produces is not competitive in today’s difficult economic context. This is due to a combination of factors, including crucially its location 400 kilometres from the nearest harbour as well as the small production output that negatively impacts fixed costs.  Although there is significant overcapacity in the European steel industry, the company has accepted the French government’s request for the government to find a buyer for the liquid phase within the next 60 days. Although the coke plant would not be part of the proposed closure, ArcelorMittal has agreed to include in the sale.  In parallel, ArcelorMittal would like to begin an exemplary social dialogue for the proposed closure of the liquid phase. Some 629 people would be affected by the project. The company understands that this information is very difficult for those employees who are affected. However the company believes that it can avoid any compulsory lay-offs by utilising a number of social mechanisms, such as mobility and the age profile of the plants, which will be agreed as part of the social dialogue in order to find a solution for each person.  The company is proposing that in the future, slab for the Florange site will continue to be transported from Dunkerque, a world class site, thereby maintaining the industrial chain in France.   ArcelorMittal will then focus on enhancing Florange’s position as a centre of excellence for developing high-quality value-added products for its customers, most notably in the automotive industry. Florange’s geographic location close to important customers in the industry; its expertise and capacity in producing high-tech steels, the group’s patents and its proximity to the Maizieres-les-Metz research and development centre, all support this strategy. For example the recent € 7.2 million investment in the existing galvanizing line will see Florange being able to produce the highest width Usibor®, in the world. ArcelorMittal is committed to continue to invest the appropriate amount to ensure a sustainable future for the finishing operations in Lorraine.   Impact of the economic crisis  ArcelorMittal’s Flat Carbon Europe segment, which includes ArcelorMittal Atlantique and Lorraine and therefore Florange, produces steel for three main sectors: automotive, industry and packaging, all of which have been significantly impacted by the economic situation and recession. The result of this has had a very negative impact on demand for steel in Europe. Today European demand is still approximately 25% below 2007 levels and any recovery is expected to be slow in the coming years.   This has in turn had a significant impact on the financial performance of FCE. Operating loss for the six month period ended June 30 2012 was EUR340 million, following a loss of EUR499 million in the second half 2011. Even in challenging economic times, steel remains a capital intensive industry. FCE capital expenditure reached US$1 billion in 2011.  Despite these significant challenges, ArcelorMittal remains very committed to its presence in France, where the company runs over 50 industrial activities across 150 operations and employs approximately 20,000 people. 35% of our flat products European production is located in France, even though the country only consumes 10% of the EU flat products market.   Commenting, Robrecht Himpe, CEO Flat Carbon Europe and member of the ArcelorMittal Management Committee, said:  \"ArcelorMittal’s operating performance has been significantly impacted by the economic situation and recession in Europe. After four years of this very difficult environment, we have regrettably concluded that given steel demand is still significantly below pre-crisis levels, we need to reconfigure our operating profile in order to strengthen the company in France and Europe to meet the ongoing challenges. ArcelorMittal fully recognises that this is a difficult announcement for those who work at the liquid phase. However it is important to emphasise that this does not represent the end of the steel industry in Lorraine. On the contrary, we will continue to invest and focus in Florange as an important centre in the transformation of slab into value-added high-quality steels for the automotive, industry and packaging sectors. Overall France remains a very important country for ArcelorMittal with 35% of our European flat products production located here, as well as one of our most important centres for research and development.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2012-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Atlantique and Lorraine announces intention to permanently close the liquid phase in Florange","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Atlantique and Lorraine met today with its central works council to discuss its intention to present a proposal for the future of its Florange plant.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-atlantique-and-lorraine-announces-intention\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6169,"text":"This follows the completion of its yearly goodwill impairment test, as required by IFRS accounting standards.  The write down will take the form of a non-cash impairment charge that will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. The impairment is due to a weaker macro economic and market environment in Europe where apparent steel demand has fallen by approximately 8% this year, bringing the cumulative demand decline to approximately 29% since 2007. This weaker demand environment, and expectations that it will persist over the near and medium term, led to a downward revision of cash flow expectations underlying the valuation of the European businesses to which goodwill has been allocated. This is in contrast to the US, where apparent steel consumption is up almost 8% this year and is now approximately 10% lower than it was in 2007.  Key metrics such as net debt and ebitda, as well as compliance with debt covenants, are unaffected by this impairment.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal to record non-cash impairment charge in Q4 2012","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announced it expects to write down the goodwill in its European businesses by approximately US$4.3bn.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-to-record-non-cash-impairment-charge\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6173,"text":"ArcelorMittal Liege today with regret informed the local works council of its intention to permanently close a number of additional assets due to a further weakening of the European economy and the resultant low demand for its products.  On 14th October 2011, ArcelorMittal Liege announced its intention to permanently idle the liquid phase due to structural over-capacity in Northern Europe. It was envisaged that in the future Liege would focus on its downstream activities, operating five core lines and seven flexible lines.      Under the flexible model, which was rejected by unions, these lines would have operated at between 0 and 100% depending on market demand. Regrettably, since October 2011, the economic outlook has further deteriorated. Demand for steel in Europe dropped by a further 8 - 9% in 2012 and is now 29% below pre-crisis levels. A number of key customers in the automotive sector have announced major restructuring projects at their plants. As a result there is insufficient demand to support the running of these flexible facilities and no improvement is seen over the medium term.      Despite the closure of the blast furnaces, the Liege facility reported an EBIT loss of more than €200million for the 9 first months of 2012 and no improvement is foreseen in 2013 due to the continued weakness of the European market. This is unsustainable on an on-going basis.      The company is therefore proposing that in order to respond to these structural market changes and further adapt to the reality of demand in Europe, the following six flexible lines need to be closed:      \\- The hot strip mill in Chertal   \\- One of the two cold rolling flows in Tilleur   \\- Galvanisation lines 4 and 5 in Flémalle   \\- Electrogalvanizing lines HP3 and 4 in Marchin  Separately organic coating line 2 in Ramet will be maintained only as a repairing line for the Combiline products.  Additionally, the company is proposing that the coke plant, which is no longer viable due to the excess supply of coke in Europe, also be permanently closed.      The company plans to continue to operate the five core lines which employ approximately 800 people. These five lines are strategic due to their dedicated high quality products, specialized processes and technological innovation.      The company recognises that this proposal will be very difficult for the local community as it affects approximately 1,300 people. It is committed to finding a socially acceptable solution for all those affected. This will include discussions on all means to reduce social impact with Trade Union representatives, including the possibility of reallocation to other sites within the Group.      Bernard Dehut, CEO, ArcelorMittal Liege, said:      “We deeply regret that the economic situation has further deteriorated to the extent that the proposal of further closures at Liege has become necessary. We recognise that this is a very difficult announcement for the employees at Liege, particularly coming so soon after the closure of the primary phase. We had hoped that that closure would be adequate in terms of adapting to the reduced demand but given the continued lack of orders and overall weakness in the European economy, it has become increasingly apparent that further action is required if we are to stem the continued losses that the plant is reporting and return it to a sustainable basis. We would ask the unions to please agree to enter into a constructive dialogue with us to secure the future of the remaining facilities in Liege.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2013-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Liege announces intention to permanently close coke plant and six finishing lines","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Liege today with regret informed the local works council of its intention to permanently close a number of additional assets due to a further weakening of the European economy and the resultant low demand for its products.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-liege-announces-intention-to-permanently\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

During the year we took a number of important steps to address the challenges we face, including concentrating our operational footprint on our more competitive assets and reducing net debt. Although we expect the challenges to continue in 2013, largely due to the fragility of the European economy, we have recently seen some more positive indicators, which combined with the measures we have implemented to strengthen the business, are expected to support an improvement in the profitability of our steel business this year.

{"id":6182,"text":"Presentations will be given by Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO; Aditya Mittal, Chief Financial Officer; Gonzalo Urquijo, GMB member with responsibility for Asia, Africa and the CIS (excluding China and India); Lou Schorsch, GMB member with responsibility for Flat Carbon Americas; Peter Kukielski, GMB member and Chief Executive Mining; Simon Wandke, Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer Mining; and Brian Aranha, Vice President of worldwide automotive.      Full copies of the presentations can be found on the Company’s website, www.arcelormittal.com.      In his presentation, Mr Mittal, Chairman and Chief Executive, will introduce the concept of what ArcelorMittal refers to as its “franchise” businesses; businesses in attractive markets where the Company has a competitive edge. Automotive, sheet piles, mechanical tubing, wide and heavy hot-rolled for high-strength applications are all examples of franchise businesses. The Company is committed to invest to grow and expand these businesses.       Automotive is a key franchise business. ArcelorMittal is the number one supplier to all the major automotive manufacturers and will continue to make the necessary investments in intellectual capital, plant and equipment in order to maintain this. The global automotive market is forecast to grow by 24% from about 80 million units in 2012 to over 100 million in 2017.[3] ArcelorMittal is well positioned to serve the automotive market with production facilities in the NAFTA region, EU27, Turkey and South America. Additionally the Company’s commercial organisation covers all regions where its global customers have a presence.       ArcelorMittal is the leader in high strength steels, which are vital to ensure steel can maintain its position as the material of choice for the auto sector. Brian Aranha, Vice President of worldwide automotive, will explain how the Company is consistently expanding its Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) offering. The S-in-motion program has developed a catalogue of solutions for achieving up to 20% of weight reduction with existing products, designed to satisfy the needs of vehicles produced up to 2020. The R&D program is already working to develop the next generation of AHSS which will be required beyond 2020, for example simulating steel solutions that will be required to meet the fuel economy targets of 54mpg in the USA and 95g\/km co2 in Europe.       Peter Kukielski will provide an update on the mining segment - another important franchise business. The Company has been steadily growing iron-ore shipments since 2008 with an emphasis on growing marketable tonnes. There are two significant steps remaining to reach its production capacity target of 84Mt by 2015 – expansion of ArcelorMittal Mines Canada and Liberia Phase 2.      The expansion at ArcelorMittal Mines Canada to a production capacity of 24MTPA is expected to be completed in the first half of 2013. This required a $1.4 billion capex investment. The existing infrastructure has the potential to support further expansion to 30 to 32Mtpa without significant additional capex. This is currently under study.       Phase 2 in Liberia has now been approved by the Board of Directors. This expansion will result in production capacity reaching 15MT pa in 2015 and will require approximately $1.5 billion of capex. The result will be a higher quality concentrate (66% Fe) compared to the current DSO (60% Fe). Major site works have already begun at the port in Buchanan, including the installation of a high speed ship loader.      In addition, the Company will provide an update on its Baffinland project. The Early Revenue Phase, which requires less capital investment than the full project, is now underway with a goal to reach a 3.5MT per annum production rate by 2015. The budget for the ERP is approximately US$700 million and will require the upgrading of the road that connects to the existing port in Milne Inlet to the mine site as well modifications to existing permits that are expected to be granted in 2013 and in the first half of 2014. Baffinland is a high grade, 66% Fe direct shipping pellet and fine ore which requires no processing or pelletization.       Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, said:      “Going forward we will protect and leverage our ‘franchise’ businesses as well as maintain a constant and rigorous focus on our costs and achievement of best internal practice. These focal points, combined with our leading market position in developed and emerging markets, our diverse mix of products, as well as our world class customer service will enable us to be successful in this new operating environment.”   ____________________________________      [1] EBITDA is defined as operating income plus depreciation, impairment expenses and exceptional items.

The online report is supplemented by a printed summary that includes the company’s CR highlights for 2012. The summary will be issued at the company’s Annual General Meeting in Luxembourg on 8 May.  The report has been externally assured by Deloitte LLP. The company has maintained the Global Reporting Initiative G3 Guidelines at level ‘B+’ in preparing the full online report.  The report focuses on how product innovation is helping to support the development of a low carbon economy, with steel playing a vital role in the transport, automotive, construction and manufacturing markets.  “The success of our business is directly linked to the advancement of society – steel is the fabric of modern life. We are supporting transport infrastructure, making cars lighter and more fuel efficient through innovative solutions such as S-in motion and iCAReTM for electric cars” said Lakshmi N. Mittal, chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal.  In addition, the report reinforces ArcelorMittal’s priorities of employee health and safety – the company’s number one priority - and responsible sourcing.  Focusing on safety, the report details the company’s progress in its safety programme ‘Journey to Zero’, most notably in its 2012 lost time injury frequency rate of 1.0 – reaching the 2013 target one year early. However, it also acknowledges that there is still much to be done to reach the target of zero injuries and fatalities and emphasises the proactive steps being taken to achieve this goal.  Other 2012 highlights include:    * Research and development: ArcelorMittal invested $285m in research and development into product and process innovation. This was supplemented by a capital expenditure of more than $321m, dedicated to environment and energy-related investments.   * Energy consumption – In 2012 the average energy used per tonne of liquid steel decreased to 23.5GJ compared to 23.8GJ in 2011.   * Responsible sourcing – ArcelorMittal assessed 295 major suppliers against its responsible sourcing criteria during the year and launched an online training module for buyers, which was completed by 400 buyers.   * Human rights – 85% of the workforce have now completed human rights training which is more than 200,000 employees.   * Community investment: The ArcelorMittal Foundation invested $41.1m in more than 725 local community projects.   * External recognition:   * Named the leading steel producer by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and ranked on main list for the third year in succession.   * Ranked fourth by Transparency International (out of 105 listed companies surveyed) for standards of reporting, in recognition of the progress made in external disclosures related to anti-corruption and bribery.   * Rated number one globally by every automotive R&D customer.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2013-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Steel: the fabric of sustainable growth - ArcelorMittal publishes Corporate Responsibility Report for 2012","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal, the world’s leading steel and mining company, today published its 2012 Corporate Responsibility (CR) Report, Steel: the fabric of sustainable growth.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/steel-the-fabric-of-sustainable-growth\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6190,"text":"Using steels and technology currently available, ArcelorMittal’s global research and development (R&D) automotive team has demonstrated that a 27 percent weight and cost saving can be achieved without compromising safety and structural requirements. By looking ahead to new advanced high strength steels and technology that will come to market over the next few years, the team has identified additional solutions that will deliver even greater weight savings – up to 34 percent compared to existing steel car door solutions.  Opening the door to weight savings  Carmakers need to reduce the weight of their vehicles in order to meet future regulations; currently-enacted regulations in Europe (tailpipe emissions) come into full force in 2015 and those for the USA (tailpipe emissions and fuel economy) come into full force in 2021. With even tougher standards being considered for the years ahead to 2025 in both regions, every part of the vehicle is being studied to determine where weight can be reduced. By reducing the weight of the vehicle by around 12 kg (26 lbs), one gram of CO2-equivalent emissions per kilometre (1.6 g\/mile) is saved.  Brian Aranha, vice president automotive worldwide said: “As the leading supplier of steels to the global automotive industry, we have worked with all carmakers for many years to help them reduce the weight of their vehicles. ArcelorMittal’s S-in motion study launched in November 2010 has already identified a whole range of innovative steel solutions that are significantly reducing the weight of the body-in-white (BIW) of current and future production vehicles, including hang-on parts such as doors. This is the next step for us in continuing to offer weight saving solutions and subsequently cost savings to our customers. Automotive is one of our franchise businesses and we are discussing with all the major OEMs to work with them to integrate these new solutions into the design of future cars.”  ### Short-term weight savings with existing steel grades  Using a combination of existing advanced high strength steels (AHSS) and ultra high strength steels (UHSS) it is now possible to reduce the weight of the baseline C-segment door from 18.3 kg (40.3 lbs) to just 13.3 kg (29.3 lbs) while meeting standard structural and safety requirements. This is truly a momentous weight reduction for one automotive application, especially considering automotive weight savings is typically measured in grams. This short-term solution uses UHSS grades such as MS 1500 and Usibor® for structural parts, and Dual Phase steels such as FF280DP for the outer panel. These steels are available now and are already being utilised in production vehicles today.  In the redesigned outer panel of the short-term front door solution, a 0.6 mm FF280DP grade is used and local reinforcements (patches) are added to improve stiffness. This solution also includes a new laser welded blank (LWB) inner panel concept with a very thin gauge.  Part of the weight savings in both the short- and medium-term solutions is achieved by using thinner steel for the outer door panel. Known as down-gauging, this technique is only possible with steels that exhibit increased yield strength while ensuring the doors will pass industry standards for dent resistance.  ### Medium-term solutions with new steel grades in development  The ‘medium-term’ solutions go further in lightweighting while maintaining the same performance levels. Local properties are optimized by the use of LWBs. Several options are possible in order to match the different types of doors to each customer’s need. The new high strength steels and technology will come to market in the next few years, making these solutions available by 2017.  The requirements of a C-segment door include the management of both frontal and lateral crash load cases. ArcelorMittal proposes an evolution of the short-term solution toward lighter doors with up to a 34 percent weight reduction, resulting in a total door weight of about 12 kg (26.4 lbs). This involves innovative steel grades which are currently under development such as Usibor® 2000 for some non-visible parts and other AHSS for the outer panel in order to reduce the outer panel thickness to 0.5 mm. The requirements for larger D-segment doors do not include the frontal crash load cases, allowing lighter doors with more limited light weighting potential.  Greg Ludkovsky, vice president global R&D said: “Many key innovations in automotive steel products and solutions in the past 10 years have come from ArcelorMittal’s R&D teams. By applying the present solutions, a car door can be 30 percent less expensive than an aluminium door. Innovative steel solutions like the ultra lightweight car door solutions are further proof that steel is by far the most sustainable, the most versatile and the most affordable material to help carmakers produce lighter vehicles and achieve their weight reduction targets on time. ”  For more information and illustrations about ArcelorMittal’s new ultra lightweight car door solutions, please visit: www.arcelormittal.com\/automotive","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2013-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal unveils new ultra lightweight car door solutions offering up to 34 percent weight savings over existing steel car doors","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel and mining company, today unveiled its new, innovative ultra lightweight car door solutions.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-unveils-new-ultra-lightweight-car-door-solutions\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6197,"text":"ArcelorMittal initially planned to construct a 12 million tonne integrated steel plant in Keonjhar and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Odisha in December 2006.   Since that date, ArcelorMittal has completed important milestones such as the completion of a feasibility report, an environmental impact assessment study and other relevant technical reports, as well as holding eight gram sabhas (public hearings) and investing in a number of CSR projects.  However, unfortunately the project has faced significant external delays. ArcelorMittal has not been able to acquire the requisite land for the steel plant, nor has it been able to ensure captive iron ore security, which is a necessary requirement for the project. Therefore, taking into account the current economic climate, ArcelorMittal has concluded it will no longer be pursuing its plans for a steel plant in Keonjhar at this stage.  This announcement does not affect ArcelorMittal’s plan to pursue its two other Indian projects in Jharkhand and Karnataka.  Vijay Bhatnagar, executive vice president and member of the management committee, CEO of India and China: “Over the last seven years we have invested considerable resources into this project; however, the delays relating to land acquisition and allocation of captive iron ore blocks means this project is no longer viable.

{"id":6202,"text":"The plan includes a project to more than double the plant’s production capacity from 1 million to 2.2 million tons per year by 2017.  The plan will see ArcelorMittal reduce its shareholding in both ArcelorMittal Annaba and ArcelorMittal Tebessa to 49%, with the state of Algeria holding the remaining share of 51%. The investment plan will be funded by equity contributions from shareholders and bank financing. The shareholders’ agreement between the parties involved is to be signed in the coming days.  This plan will ensure a long term future for steelmaking in Annaba and mining in Tebessa, where the production unit will be modernized through the relining of the blast furnace, modernization of the sinter plant, the steel plant and the rolling mills. A new electric steel plant will be built (including an electric arc furnace and continuous casting line) and the downstream units will be reinforced with the construction of a new rolling mill for rebar and wire rod with a production capacity of 1 million tons.  The investment will allow ArcelorMittal Annaba to better respond to increasing domestic demand for steel products in Algeria and to positively contribute to the government’s drive to promote self-sufficiency in steel.  The agreement includes a human resources development plan. Intensive training will be provided to employees in order to adapt to the new technologies planned. This plan is backed by a social stability pact that has been agreed with the unions.  “We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Sider, with whom we have always enjoyed a strong relationship. The agreement will enable ArcelorMittal Annaba and ArcelorMittal Tebessa to play a long term role in Algeria’s steel and mining industries.

{"id":6214,"text":"The segment recorded an operating loss of €366m for Q4 2013. Operating performance in the fourth quarter was impacted by net restructuring charges of €236m, primarily as a result of the industrial and social plan in Liege and review of Florange primary production.  Q4 2013 losses compare with an operating loss of €131m in Q3 2013.   This segment’s crude steel production remained flat, compared to Q3 2013, at 7.4 million tonnes.  Steel shipments in Q4 2013 were 6.7 million tonnes, an increase of 1.6% as compared to the previous quarter, due to a mild pick- up in demand following the seasonally weak third quarter.  Sales in the Flat Carbon Europe segment also increased by 0.8% to €4.83bn, compared with €4.78bn in the third quarter. This was primarily due to higher steel shipment volumes.  Ebitda for the quarter increased by 11.6% to €163m, compared with €146m in the third quarter. This resulted mainly from a positive volume effect and excellent operational performance across FCE mills.  Commenting, Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO Flat Carbon Europe, said:  “We are seeing the positive effects of asset optimisation and an improved operational performance across FCE mills in 2013 results. With a recovery in underlying steel demand and mild restocking, we expect to see European steel demand rise by around 2% in 2014.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2014-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Flat Carbon Europe reports €366m operating loss for Q4 2013","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announced results for its Flat Carbon Europe segment for the fourth quarter of 2013.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-flat-carbon-europe-reports-366m\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6223,"text":"The segment recorded an operating profit of €58 million for the first three months of 2014. This compares with an operating loss of €396 million in Q4 2013. Comparable operating performance for Q4 2013 was impacted by impairment and restructuring charges totalling €302 million. There were no such impairment or restructuring charges this quarter.  Ebitda for the quarter also rose, by 29% to €390 million, compared with €302 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This improvement has been mainly driven by higher shipments and a positive price cost effect.  ArcelorMittal Europe crude steel production increased by 4.3% to 10.9 million tonnes, compared with Q4 2013, following the restart of the blast furnace in Dabrowa Gornicza, Poland, as maintenance work concluded.  Steel shipments in Q1 2014 were 10.0 million tonnes, an increase of 5.6% compared with the previous quarter. Flat product shipment volumes increased by 5.8% and long product shipment volumes increased by 6.0%, both benefitting from seasonality and improved underlying demand.  Sales in the ArcelorMittal Europe segment also increased by 1.6% to €7.5 billion, compared with €7.4 billion in the fourth quarter. This was primarily due to higher steel shipments.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said:  “ArcelorMittal Europe’s first quarter results for 2014 show a combination of a gradually improving economy and the results of measures the company has taken to adapt to the new demand environment. As the pace of recovery in the EU has been slightly stronger than expected when we announced our full year results in February, we have upgraded our forecast for European steel demand in 2014 from around 2%, to 2-3%, and therefore remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2014-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe reports €58m operating profit for Q1 2014","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe today announced results for the first quarter of 2014.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-reports-58m-operating-profit\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

This compares with an operating profit of €58 million in Q1 2014 and an operating loss of €143 million for Q2 2013, when results were impacted by restructuring and impairment charges totalling €125m. There were no such impairment or restructuring charges in Q2 2014.  Ebitda for the second quarter of 2014 also rose, by 29%, to €503m, compared with €390m in the first quarter of this year.

ArcelorMittal Europe has reported an operating profit in all four quarters of 2014, with the business realising the benefits of its cost optimisation measures, lower input costs and better margins due to improved steel market conditions and a stronger focus on new and specialised products.       Fourth quarter 2014 Ebitda increased by 12.4%, to €443m compared with €394m in the previous three months of the year. Ebitda in Q4 2014 was also 46.7% higher than in the same quarter of 2013. Full year Ebitda for 2014 was €1730m compared to €1227m for 2013.      Steel shipments in Q4 2014 were 9.6 million tonnes; a decrease of 2.2% compared with the previous quarter, on account of operational issues in some sites and lower exports for the quarter. Year-on-year, shipments for the fourth quarter rose as a result of improved domestic demand.      Sales in the ArcelorMittal Europe segment decreased by 1.3% to €7.2bn this quarter, compared with €7.3bn in the third quarter. This was primarily due to lower shipments.       Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said:       “I am pleased to be able to report the fourth consecutive quarterly profit for ArcelorMittal Europe, as well as a 41% year-on-year increase in Ebitda. This Ebitda rise shows the expansion in our steel margins thanks to lower costs, which are the result of our cost optimisation efforts and improved market conditions. For 2015, we are forecasting steel demand growth of 1.5 to 2.5%, for Europe, with the effects of a weak Euro and low oil prices helping to boost confidence within the Eurozone”.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2015-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe reports €122m operating profit for Q4 2014","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe today announced its results for the fourth quarter ended 31 December 2014.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-reports-122m-operating-profit\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6246,"text":"Strategic progress in 2014:  The Company has made notable progress on its strategic objectives during 2014, including:    * Increased steel volumes by 3% given improved demand in its core steel markets   * Expanded steel margins by $14\/t through continued focus on cost optimization: leveraging benefits of European restructuring, improved performance of ACIS operations as well as lower raw material costs   * Expanded mining volumes (including a 4Q 2014 annualized production rate of 26Mt at ArcelorMittal Mines Canada (AMMC)) whilst further reducing mining costs (4Q 2014 AMMC concentrate unit cost 25% lower than FY 2013 average)   * Further developed its automotive steel franchise including new capacity (Calvert, VAMA) and new product launches   * Net debt declined to its lowest level since the ArcelorMittal merger which together with lower average cost of debt reduced net interest expense by $0.3 billion    Outlook and guidance:    * The Company expects Group EBITDA to be within the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for 2015   * Steel segments: Overall, steel markets continue to grow, in particular for our high value-added products; a forecast 4-5% increase in shipment volumes (approximately half of which follows the Newcastle reline completion and full year impact of the restart of BF#3 in Tubarao, Brazil) together with improved cost performance are expected to offset the impact of lower transaction prices and the impacts of translation   * Mining segment: Assuming current market conditions, in excess of one-third of the impact of lower iron ore prices on revenues will be offset by improved cost performance including the benefits of foreign exchange, energy and freight as well as higher volumes   * Additionally, the Company expects net interest expense to decline to approximately $1.4 billion and capital expenditure to decline to approximately $3.4 billion in 2015   * As a result, at the bottom end of the guidance range the Company would expect to be free cash flow positive.

First quarter 2015 Ebitda increased by 23.3 per cent, to €546m compared with €443m in the last quarter of 2014. Ebitda in Q1 2015 was also 40 per cent higher than in the corresponding quarter of 2014, reflecting improved demand dynamics and the ongoing realisation of the benefits of cost optimisation efforts.       Steel shipments in the first quarter increased by 10.9 per cent to 10.7 million tonnes, compared with Q4 2014, as both flat and long product shipment volumes benefitted from seasonal impacts and improved underlying demand.      Sales in the ArcelorMittal Europe segment increased by 5.9 per cent to €7.6bn this quarter compared to Q4 2014. This was primarily due to higher steel shipments partly offset by lower average steel selling prices.

{"id":6268,"text":"While Ebitda for the quarter was €496 million, the segment recorded an operating loss of €23 million, compared with an operating profit of €125 million for Q3 2014.  Record levels of imports, particularly from China and the CIS, have placed significant downward pressure on European steel prices. As a result, the segment’s operating profit for the third quarter was negatively impacted by a €256 million exceptional charge related to the write-down of inventory following the rapid decline of international steel prices.   ArcelorMittal Europe sales also decreased by -5.7 per cent to €6.9 billion this quarter, from €7.3 billion in the corresponding quarter last year, as a result of lower average selling prices and marginally lower steel shipments. Steel shipments in the third quarter decreased by -1.9 per cent to 9.6 million tonnes, compared with Q3 2014.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said: “Record, and still rising, levels of imports are materially impacting steel prices. Certain EU anti-dumping investigations are underway, but the process is slow and needs to be more efficient in order to effectively and fairly protect European steel producers from unfair trade. The ongoing price deterioration has led us to book a €256 million exceptional charge for the quarter, meaning we have reported an operating loss for the first time in seven quarters.\"  “Outlook for European steel demand remains positive, and we forecast apparent steel consumption in 2016 at similar levels to the +2 per cent we have seen for this year. However, given imports into the European market are forecast to remain at high levels, we anticipate pricing pressure to continue into 2016, which will make it challenging for European steelmakers to benefit from the ongoing demand recovery.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2015-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe reports operating loss of €23 million for Q3 2015","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe today announced its results for the third quarter ended 30 September 2015.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-reports-operating-loss-of-23-million\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6269,"text":"Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, ArcelorMittal Chairman and CEO, said:  “Whilst we have delivered stable EBITDA compared with the second quarter, the already challenging operating conditions have further deteriorated during recent months, largely due to additional declines in steel prices caused by exceptionally low Chinese export prices. Our focus is on ensuring we take all the necessary steps to strengthen our competitiveness in this difficult environment. Measures we have taken so far are yielding results; costs in our mining division have reduced by 17% so far in 2015 versus an initial target of 15%, and net debt is $1 billion lower than a year ago. Whilst we expect market conditions to remain challenging in 2016, we have a number of important programs underway across the business which will structurally improve EBITDA in 2016 and we also expect a significant reduction in our cash requirements.”  “Whilst we are confident our actions are the right ones, there are also important issues for governments to address, specifically relating to unfair trade.

{"id":6270,"text":"Mr Schorsch joined the company in 2003 as CEO of Ispat Inland.      Going forward it has been decided to structure the Americas business with dedicated leadership for four distinct business areas.      Jim Baske will be Executive Vice President of ArcelorMittal and chief Executive Officer ArcelorMittal North America (excluding USA).  John Brett, currently executive vice president finance, planning and procurement for ArcelorMittal USA, will be appointed chief executive of ArcelorMittal USA effective 1st January 2016. Andy Harshaw, the current CEO of ArcelorMittal USA, is retiring but will stay with the company until 31st March 2016 to assist with the leadership transition.       In South America, Jefferson de Paula and Benjamin Baptista will continue as CEO South America Long and CEO South America Flat respectively.       All four will report to group chairman and CEO, Lakshmi N. Mittal.       Brian Aranha, currently vice president global automotive and commercial coordination, will assume leadership responsibilities for Mr Schorsch’s additional roles of strategy, CTO, R&D, CCM and global automotive, also reporting to Mr Lakshmi Mittal. He will be supported by David Clarke as head of strategy and CTO, Greg Ludkovsky as head of R&D and Brad Davey as head of global automotive.       Separately Robrecht Himpe, currently executive vice president and CTO of ArcelorMittal, will be appointed chief executive of AM\/NS Calvert, working closely with AM\/NS Calvert president Chris Richards and the rest of the Calvert team to accelerate the ramp-up of this important asset.       Commenting Mr Mittal said, \"Since joining the company in 2003, Lou has been an integral member of our senior leadership team. With a keen intellect and deep understanding of the dynamics of our industry as a result of his experience in both consultancy and operational roles, he has been a strong leader who is held in high esteem by all who know and work with him. We wish him all the best for his retirement.\"       “There are a number of important priorities in the Americas business at present and therefore we took the decision to split out the leadership responsibilities into four key areas, directly reporting to the CEO. We believe this is the optimum structure to ensure each division fully delivers on their business plans and puts in place the necessary actions to respond to current market challenges and capture market opportunities. Jim, John, Jefferson and Benjamin are all experienced leaders and fully understand the priorities in today’s market environment. Additionally I am very pleased that Robrecht has agreed to become CEO of AM\/NS Calvert. The opportunities for Calvert are considerable and it has an important contribution to make to the US$1 billion of structural Ebitda improvements the group is targeting globally for 2016. As one of our most experienced industry executives, I am very confident in Robrecht’s ability to ensure we capture all the upside potential from this outstanding asset.”       Additionally Mr BC Agarwal, 64, group head of finance and member of the management committee, will retire effective the end of February 2016. Mr Agarwal joined the company in 1973 and was involved in the setting up of the first plant in Indonesia. Genuino Christino will take up the position of group head of finance, reporting to Aditya Mittal, group CFO and CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe.       Commenting Mr Mittal said: “Bhikam was one of the first employees of ArcelorMittal. He was with me in the early days in Indonesia when we had nothing but a green field in front of us and has been with the company ever since. His energy, enthusiasm and knowledge will be much missed but I can only wish him an extremely well deserved retirement.\"      Aditya Mittal said: \"Mr Agarwal has made an outstanding contribution to this company over more than 40 years. He is someone who will always be considered part of ArcelorMittal, even in his retirement. His shoes are hard to fill but I have worked very closely with Genuino for a number of years now and have great confidence in his ability to step into this important position.\"      ArcelorMittal will also take the opportunity to simplify the management structure in-line with the ongoing drive to promote a performance-driven culture, empowering the segments to deliver optimum business results. As a result the Group Management Board, which was established to ensure a smooth integration following the creation of ArcelorMittal, will be replaced with a more flexible structure. The CEO office - comprising the CEO and CFO - will work directly with a team of seven executive officers, who collectively encompass the key regions and corporate functions.   The executive officers are as follows:  Senior executive vice president    * Davinder Chugh Senior executive vice president, CEO of Africa and the CIS    Executive vice presidents    * Brian Aranha Executive vice president, head of strategy, CTO, R&D, CCM and global automotive   * Jim Baske Executive vice president, CEO ArcelorMittal Nafta Flat Rolled   * Henri Blaffart Executive vice president, group head of HR and corporate services   * Jefferson de Paula Executive vice president, CEO of ArcelorMittal South America Long   * Geert van Poelvoorde Executive vice president, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe Flat   * Simon Wandke Executive vice president, CEO of ArcelorMittal Mining","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2015-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal announces new organisational structure for the Americas and group finance","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announces that Lou Schorsch, 66, senior executive vice president, member of the Group Management Board and CEO of ArcelorMittal Americas will retire from the company, effective end of February 2016.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-announces-new-organisational\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6274,"text":"For the full year 2015, the Europe segment reported an operating profit of €145m. This compares with an operating profit of €549m in 2014, reflecting the impact of lower steel prices on the business. Full-year Ebitda for 2015 was €2,158m, compared with €1,730m in 2014.      For the fourth quarter of 2015, ArcelorMittal Europe recorded an operating loss of €465m, compared with a profit of €122m for the same quarter in 2014. However the Q4 2015 performance was impacted by impairments of €366m, primarily in connection with the temporary idling of ArcelorMittal Sestao in Spain, as well as €316m of inventory write-downs following the rapid decline of steel prices.       Ebitda in Q4 2015 improved by 12.5% year-on-year, mainly due to lower costs and efficiency improvements partly offset by lower average steel selling prices (-10.2%) and lower steel shipments (-1.4%).       In terms of production, crude steel production fell by 8.2% to 10 million tonnes in the final quarter of 2015, compared with the previous quarter, primarily due to lower demand and maintenance works including the reline of a blast furnace in Dunkirk, France, and repairs to a blast furnace in Gent, Belgium.       The business’ 2015 performance has been significantly impacted by the drop in steel prices in Europe, as a result of lower demand in China which has caused record levels of unfairly priced imports into the European Union.       ArcelorMittal, together with all steel producers in Europe, has been consistently calling for the European Union to use trade defence instruments to impose tariffs on unfairly priced steel imports, in order to ensure a long-term future for the steel industry in Europe.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2016-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe reports €145m operating profit for 2015","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe today announced its results for the full year 2015 and the fourth quarter ended 31 December 2015.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-reports-145m-operating-profit\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

The Action 2020 plan represents a strategic roadmap for each of ArcelorMittal’s main business segments. The Action 2020 plan is over and above the Company’s ongoing management gains plan and seeks to deliver real structural improvements unique to ArcelorMittal’s business. The Action 2020 plan targets a return to >$85\/t EBITDA absent any recovery in steel spreads and raw materials prices from current levels. The Action 2020 plan targets a further structural EBITDA improvement of approximately $3.0 billion. Upon full achievement of the plan, the Company would expect to deliver free cash flow in excess of $2.0 billion annually.  Outlook and guidance:  As indicated at 3Q 2015 results, a combination of Company actions and known developments is expected to support EBITDA in 2016 by $1.0 billion relative to the 4Q 2015 annual run-rate level. Due to order book and the time lag required for lower raw material costs to positively impact cost of sales, EBITDA is expected to sequentially decline in 1Q 2016. Based on the assumption of prevailing raw material costs and spot steel spreads, the Company expects FY 2016 EBITDA to be in excess of $4.5 billion. This guidance does not capture any upside to current market conditions.  Reducing the cash requirements of the business:  The Company targets a reduction of the cash requirements of the business in 2016 by in excess of $1.0 billion as compared to 2015.

{"id":6277,"text":"The transaction is unconditional and payment is expected to be made to ArcelorMittal within six months. In addition to the cash consideration, ArcelorMittal will receive a payment of €10m as a 2015 dividend.       ArcelorMittal entered into a joint venture with the Riberas family in 1998 with the intent of developing, through Gestamp, the business of stamping, assembly and welded blanks for automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Over the years, Gestamp has established itself as a global market leader in the design and manufacture of metal components and assemblies for sale to automotive OEMs, with a leadership position in hot-stamped technology. Gestamp now operates 95 plants located in 20 countries, supplying body-in-white, chassis structures, opening systems and mechanisms to all the major car manufacturers from Europe, the Americas and Asia.      ArcelorMittal will continue its supply relationship with Gestamp through its 35% shareholding in Gonvarri, a sister company of Gestamp. ArcelorMittal sells coils to Gonvarri for processing before they pass to Gestamp and other customers. Further, ArcelorMittal will continue to have a board presence in Gestamp, collaborate in automotive R&D and remain its major steel supplier.       Aditya Mittal, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe and group CFO, said: \"The sale of our stake in Gestamp unlocks substantial value for ArcelorMittal’s shareholders and is consistent with our stated strategy of portfolio optimisation.

The record date for ArcelorMittal shares is expected to be on March 14, 2016 at the close of business on each applicable market where the shares are traded.

{"id":6294,"text":"Lower prices were however offset in part by higher steel shipment volumes and improved cost performance.       ArcelorMittal Europe reported an operating profit of €77m for the first three months of the year, compared with a €465m operating loss in the previous quarter. The fourth quarter 2015 performance was significantly impacted by impairments and inventory write-downs. Comparing year-on-year, ArcelorMittal Europe reported an operating profit of €281m for the first quarter of 2015.       The Europe segment’s crude steel production for Q1 2016 rose 11.9% to 11.2 million tonnes, compared with the previous three months. Sales also rose, by 0.6% to €6.5bn, driven by a 13.7% increase in demand for flat steel products and an overall 10.3% increase in steel shipments, compared with Q4 2015.       While steel spreads have improved since the start of 2016, price rises are not expected to be visible until the second quarter.       Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe and CFO ArcelorMittal, said:      “Today we reported a 34% drop in Ebitda, which shows the impact of low steel prices on our business - although we were able to offset some of the effect of low prices thanks to our ongoing focus on cost performance.       Today’s results also reflect improved demand for steel in Europe. Our shipments rose by more than 10% to 10.4 million tonnes in Q1 2016, compared with the final quarter of 2015. This stronger demand has led to a welcome improvement in steel spreads, in recent months – resulting in a tight market, for flat products in particular. However, the market remains highly volatile; we must remain vigilant against steel dumping in Europe, in order to ensure that steel is traded in line with WTO regulations.”      Steel demand in Europe this year is expected to remain more than 21% below pre-2007 levels, compared with the Nafta region where demand is forecast to be 4.6% below 2007 levels (see chart, below).","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2016-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe reports €328m Ebitda for first quarter of 2016","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe has announced its results for the first quarter of 2016, reporting a 34% drop in Ebitda to €328m compared with Q4 2015, mainly due to a 7.2% decline in average steel selling prices for the first three months of 2016.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-reports-328m-ebitda-for-first\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

At the Early Tender Time, the Company determined a single Clearing Premium of $42.50 based on the Bid Premiums (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) for all Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time in accordance with the modified “Dutch Auction” procedure described in the section “The Offers—Description of the Offers—Clearing Premium and Total Consideration” in the Offer to Purchase. The “ Total Consideration ” set forth in the table above for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time and not validly withdrawn and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers is equal to the sum of: (i) the Minimum Bid Price for the relevant Series and (ii) the Clearing Premium determined in accordance with this modified “Dutch Auction” procedure.

{"id":6302,"text":"Year-on-year, Q2 operating profit in 2016 was slightly lower compared to €352m in Q2 2015. However, operating income in Q2 2016 was negatively impacted by an impairment of €44m relating to the sale of ArcelorMittal Zaragoza in Spain.       A year-on-year Ebitda comparison shows a 4.2% improvement to €643m, principally due to lower costs and efficiency improvements as a result of ArcelorMittal Europe’s ongoing transformation plan. This was offset in part by lower selling prices, which were down by around 11%.       Commenting on the results, Aditya Mittal, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe, said:       “Today’s results from ArcelorMittal Europe show the combined effect of improved market conditions compared with the beginning of the year, and our ongoing transformation plan which is making the business more efficient. While we are pleased with today’s results, Europe remains exposed to the effects of steel dumping. Although we have been encouraged by the high-level political engagement on this matter in recent months, it remains important that this translates into robust trade defence measures”.

{"id":6305,"text":"Subject to the Maximum Tender Cap, the amount of a Series of Notes that is purchased in the Offers on the applicable Settlement Date (as defined below) will be based on the numerical order of priority (the “ Acceptance Priority Level ”) for such Series, subject to the proration arrangements applicable to the Offers, as set forth in the table above.  This announcement does not contain the full terms and conditions of the Offers, which are contained in the offer to purchase dated September 7, 2016 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “ Offer to Purchase ”), and is subject to the offer restrictions set out below and more fully described in the Offer to Purchase.  Notes may be validly tendered at any time on or before 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 4, 2016, unless extended (as may be extended, the “ Expiration Time ”). Notes must be tendered in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Offer to Purchase. To receive the Total Consideration (as defined herein), plus any Accrued Interest, Holders must tender their Notes prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 20, 2016, unless extended (such time, as the same may be extended, the “ Early Tender Time ”). The “ Total Consideration ” is the U.S. dollar amount payable per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes set forth in the table above and includes an early tender premium of $50 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (the “ Early Tender Premium ”). Holders who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Time but at or prior to the Expiration Time will only be eligible to receive the “ Tender Consideration ”, which is the applicable Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Premium, plus any Accrued Interest.  Subject to applicable law, the Company expressly reserves the right, but is not obligated to, increase the Maximum Tender Cap in its sole and absolute discretion without extending the Early Tender Time, the Withdrawal Deadline (as defined below) or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights.  Subject to the Maximum Tender Cap and the proration arrangements applicable to the Offers, all Notes of a Series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Time having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any tendered Notes of a Series having a lower Acceptance Priority Level. Among any Notes validly tendered following the Early Tender Time but at or prior to the Expiration Time, Notes having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any Notes tendered following the Early Tender Time having a lower Acceptance Priority Level, subject to the Maximum Tender Cap. If the Offers are not fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Time, subject to the Maximum Tender Cap, Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Time will be accepted for purchase in priority to Notes tendered following the Early Tender Time even if such Notes tendered following the Early Tender Time have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time. As such, Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time will be accepted for purchase in priority to Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time, and to the extent that Notes are tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time, the Maximum Tender Cap available after the Early Tender Time could be reduced significantly or altogether. Accordingly, if the Maximum Tender Cap is reached in respect of tenders made at or prior to the Early Tender Time, no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time will be accepted for purchase (irrespective of their priority level).  With respect to the Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time and not validly withdrawn and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers, the Company expects to pay the Total Consideration, together with any accrued and unpaid interest from, and including, the immediately preceding interest payment date applicable to such Notes to, but excluding, the applicable Settlement Date (the “ Accrued Interest ”), to the Holders on the third Business Day after the Early Tender Time, expected to be September 23, 2016 (such date, the “ Early Settlement Date ”). With respect to Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Time but at or prior to the Expiration Time and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers, the Company expects to pay the Tender Consideration, together with any Accrued Interest, to the Holders thereof on the third Business Day after the Expiration Time, expected to be October 7, 2016 (such date the “ Final Settlement Date ”; each of the Early Settlement Date and the Final Settlement Date, a “ Settlement Date ”).

{"id":6309,"text":"Year-on-year, operating profit has risen significantly, albeit from a very low base; ArcelorMittal Europe reported an operating loss of €23m in the third quarter of 2015, when European steel prices were under strong downward pressure from record levels of imports.       A year-on-year Ebitda comparison shows a 29.4% rise to €642m, compared with Q3 2015, primarily on account of lower costs and efficiency improvements, offset in part by lower steel volumes (-2.7%) and lower average steel selling prices (-3.3%).       In terms of steel production, ArcelorMittal Europe’s crude steel production decreased by 1.4% to 10.6 million tonnes in Q3 2016, compared with 10.7 million tonnes in Q2 2016 as a result of seasonal planned stoppages.      Commenting on the results, Aditya Mittal, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe, said:    “Today’s results from ArcelorMittal Europe reflect the usual seasonal slowdown in production and shipments, but also the improved pricing environment and the impact of measures to make the business more efficient. Operating profit has improved 8.9% in the past three months and is also positive year-on-year.      We remain concerned about unfair trade. We have seen some positive trade case rulings this year but a comprehensive solution is required across all product categories, to prevent anti-competitive behaviour in the European market.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2016-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe reports €371m operating profit for Q3 2016","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe has reported its third quarter 2016 results, with a €371m operating profit for the three months to 30 September 2016 – higher than the €340m operating profit reported in the second quarter of 2016.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-reports-371m-operating-profit\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6310,"text":"New grades will help automakers achieve mandated lightweighting targets and promote more sustainable lifestyles  These innovative steels include the launch of new press hardenable steels (PHS) Ductibor® 1000 and Usibor® 2000 – both of which are already available for OEM qualification testing in Europe - and martensitic steels MartINsite® M1700 and M2000. The company is also preparing to expand its family of third generation advanced high strength steel (3G AHSS), which currently includes Fortiform® 1050 in Europe, starting in 2017. Together, these new steel grades will help automakers further reduce body-in-white weight to improve fuel economy without compromising vehicle safety or performance.  “The launch of these steels aligns with our Action 2020 program, a strategic roadmap that aims to achieve targeted financial improvements for the company by 2020,” said Brian Aranha, executive vice president, global automotive, ArcelorMittal. “Action 2020 efforts include cost optimization and steel shipment volume increases, as well as an improved portfolio of high added value products. These products ensure ArcelorMittal is best positioned to meet customer requirements via a strong technical and product portfolio.”  ArcelorMittal is now able to provide samples of Ductibor® 1000 to customers for qualification testing in North America. Ductibor® 1000 is a high-strength press hardenable steel that offers good energy absorption capacity. Typical applications for Ductibor® 1000 include energy absorption parts such as front and rear rails and lower B-pillars.  Usibor® 2000, an aluminum-silicon coated PHS and stronger than its predecessor Usibor® 1500, enables automakers to fabricate parts with complicated geometry at a very high strength without formability or springback challenges. Typical applications for Usibor® 2000 include strength-critical passenger compartment parts such as rockers, pillars, roof rails and cross members. Usibor® 2000 is currently available in Europe for OEM qualifications and will be available in North America in early 2017 with commercial production expected in late summer 2017.  “Usibor® is our key product in hot stamping and has been a major commercial and technical success in the global automotive industry,” said Mr. Aranha. “Looking ahead, the scope of hot stamping products in vehicles will continue to increase with the release of more advanced products like Usibor® 2000, which offers 10 to 15% weight savings when compared to existing hot stamping solutions.”      Usibor® 2000 is compatible with standard press hardening technologies and processes. Combining Usibor® 2000 with Ductibor® 1000 or other PHS into laser welded blanks (LWB) offers several significant advantages. These advantages include weight saving, improved crash behaviour and cost savings through material and manufacturing optimisation.  ArcelorMittal is also expanding its MartINsite® family of products to include MartINsite® M1700 and M2000, joining currently available MartINsite® M900, M1100, M1300 and M1500.  “MartINsite® is a very strong family of steels which are perfect for anti-intrusion parts such as bumper and door beams,” explained Mr. Aranha.  ArcelorMittal will have MartINsite® M1700 and M2000 available for OEM qualifications by mid-2017. The grades will be available for commercial production in early 2018.  All MartINsite® steels, Usibor® 1500 and 2000, and Ductibor® 500 and 1000 are all patented by ArcelorMittal.  ArcelorMittal is also investing in AM\/NS Calvert, its joint venture with Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metals Corp. in Alabama, USA, to produce 3G AHSS cold-stamping steels in North America. Currently available and branded as Fortiform® in Europe, these High Formability (HF) steels provide strengths similar to the strongest dual phase steels, but with higher ductility and cold formability.  ArcelorMittal will produce cold-rolled and galvanized\/galvannealed versions of HF 980 and HF 1180 in North America, targeting OEM qualifications by mid-2017. Commercial production, beginning with the cold-rolled grades, will occur in late 2017. Thanks to their excellent mechanical properties, these HF grades are particularly suitable for components limited by energy absorption, such as front and rear rails and upper motor compartment rails.  In Europe, an investment program is underway at ArcelorMittal Gent and ArcelorMittal Liege in Belgium, to increase ArcelorMittal’s annual European production of 3G AHSS.   Globally, ArcelorMittal boasts some of the most technologically advanced automotive steelmaking operations and incorporates a range of modern steelmaking technologies. Approximately 30% of the company’s global R&D budget - $227 million in 2015 - is for automotive research.  \"ArcelorMittal's current and emerging catalogue of automotive products and solutions supports carmakers in optimising vehicle weight and cost, while meeting stringent safety standards. We are also committed to manufacturing products that advance sustainable lifestyles. Steel helps cars to be lighter, which reduces carbon emissions, but it is also infinitely and easily recyclable. Additionally, compared to competing materials, steel has a significantly smaller environmental footprint.” concluded Mr. Aranha.

{"id":6311,"text":"Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, ArcelorMittal Chairman and CEO, said:  “Our third quarter results reflect the progress the Company is making to improve the underlying performance of the business, as well as improved market conditions since the start of the year. Despite seasonally lower shipments, EBITDA improved compared with both the second quarter and the same period of 2015.  Looking ahead, while real demand remains stable, we will be impacted by the unexpected significant increase in the price of coal. While expectations are for steel prices to align with the increased costs, in the interim the higher coal price will impact steel spreads and fourth quarter performance.   Overcapacity remains a concern, reinforcing the importance of a comprehensive trade response to minimise the impact of unfair trade across all product categories. But overall we remain pleased with the progress we have made this year. We are supported by a strong balance sheet, we have seen positive price momentum in our main markets and the organisation is fully aligned to successfully implement our five year strategic plan, Action 2020.”  Third quarter 2016 earnings analyst conference call  ### ArcelorMittal management will host a conference call for members of the investment community to discuss the third quarter period ended September 30, 2016 on:  Date | US Eastern time | London | CET   ---|---|---|---   Friday July 29, 2016 |  9.30am |  2.30pm |  3.30pm   The dial in numbers:   Location | Toll free dial in numbers | Local dial in numbers | Participant   UK local: | 0800 051 5931 | +44 (0)203 364 5807 | 06718751#   USA local: | 1 86 6719 2729  |  +1 24 0645 0345 | 06718751#   US (New York) | 1 86 6719 2729  | \\+ 1 64 6663 7901 | 06718751#   France: | 0800 914 780  | +33 1 70 71 29 16 | 06718751#   Germany: | 0800 965 6288 | +49 692 7134 0801 | 06718751#   Spain: | 90 099 4930 |  +34 911 143 436 | 06718751#   Luxembourg: | 800 26908 | +352 27 86 05 07 | 06718751#   A replay of the conference call will be available for one week by dialing:   Number | Language | Access code |    +49 (0) 1805 2047 088 | English | 493108# |","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2016-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal reports third quarter 2016 results","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (referred to as “ArcelorMittal” or the “Company”) (MT (New York, Amsterdam, Paris, Luxembourg), MTS (Madrid)), the world’s leading integrated steel and mining company, today announced results[1] for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-reports-third-quarter-2016-results\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6315,"text":"The formation of STEELCAME, in which ArcelorMittal will hold a 35 per cent shareholding, with the Cellino Group holding the remaining 65 per cent, concludes ArcelorMittal’s search for a strategic partner for its SoluStil business to strengthen the competitiveness of the business, which has been under pressure in recent years due to the highly challenging market in which it operates.      STEELCAME’s assets will consist of four former SoluStil sites in the Rhône-Alpes region, namely La Boisse, Trévoux, Arnas, Montélier, together with Stalobrex, a Polish steel processing business owned by ArcelorMittal. The Cellino Group will contribute two assets to the JV, the Italian company Intek, and the Polish company SHL, both of them active in steel processing and steel components manufacturing.      Commenting, Vijay Goyal, CEO, ArcelorMittal Distribution Solutions, said:      “I am very pleased that we have been able to finalise this joint venture agreement. It concludes our search for a strategic partner for our SoluStil business and I am confident that in the Cellino Group we have found the right partner to strengthen the business and improve its operational and financial performance. This deal safeguards the future of SoluStil’s business and its workforce. Significant synergies exist between the two businesses and combining the various assets in a joint venture will facilitate knowledge exchange, investment, enhanced customer service levels and enable STEELCAME to develop its customer base.”      Fabrizio Cellino, C.E.O. Cellino group, added:      “I’m proud of and strongly motivated by the final creation of this JV between ArcelorMittal Distribution Solutions and the Cellino Group. Assets respectively contributed by the two partners to the newly founded STEELCAME will guarantee a wide and diverse portfolio of industrial processes and technologies that are able to satisfy customers’ needs in a multitude of industries.

{"id":6325,"text":"The investments, two focused on further improvements in the company’s environmental performance and a third project designed to modernize the production of one of the steel plant’s key products, bring total investments in ArcelorMittal Zenica to more than €160m, including €50m targeted specifically for environmental improvements.   Prior to ArcelorMittal’s arrival in Zenica in 2004, the steel plant had been largely out of operation since 1992, with little or no investment made at the factory for several decades.  ArcelorMittal Zenica is the first steel plant in the world to have industrial-scale hybrid filtration technology installed in its sinter plant. A total of €3m has been invested in the new technology, which has cut dust emissions significantly, to well below the EU limit of 20 mg\/Nm3. The company plans to install a second filter, so that both sinter plant stacks’ dust emissions are filtered.   The filter technology is the culmination of a major collaboration between Danish global engineering company FLSmidth and ArcelorMIttal’s R&D team, with a team of seven researchers and six technicians working on the design and testing stages of the project. It is to the credit of the teams involved that the project went from concept to industrialisation within two years.    ArcelorMittal signed a collaboration agreement with FLSmidth to build a pilot plant for the filter in Gijón, Spain, as well as to work together on adapting the technology – which was originally developed for cement plants – to work in sinter plants, which convert iron ore into sinter feed which is then used in the blast furnace.  In addition, ArcelorMittal is installing the technology in its operations in Dąbrowa Górnicza, Poland, while a third installation in Gent, Belgium, is also in progress.   Speaking about the filter innovation, Pinakin Chaubal, head of process R&D at ArcelorMittal, said:  “I’m extremely proud of the team involved in this project, which sets a new global standard for sinter plant emissions. The installation of the hybrid filter in ArcelorMittal Zenica is an important milestone in the project which has involved our R&D team, ArcelorMittal technical specialists, and ArcelorMittal sites in Bosnia & Herzegovina and Spain. I would also like to thank FLSmidth for their highly professional collaboration on this innovative development.”  New technology has also been introduced to achieve major reductions in smoke and gas emissions from ArcelorMittal Zenica’s coke battery. The smokeless charging car, a €4.2m investment, cuts charging times, delivering an almost smoke-free charging process and prevents CO2 emissions being released into the atmosphere. The technology was provided by the UK engineering firm John M. Henderson Machines.   A team of JMH Machines engineers supervised the testing of the mechanical, electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic systems on the ground level, before the 126-tonne car was lifted in one piece into position on the coke oven battery.  New product range  An investment of €5.2m has also been made, to make ArcelorMittal Zenica the first plant in ArcelorMittal Europe to produce rebar in coil.   This is one of ArcelorMittal Zenica’s most important products, which offers customers efficiencies in terms of cutting down on wastage and storage space, and annual production capacity will be raised from 300,000 to 320,000 tonnes, while introducing improvements in the product quality and range, ease of storage and delivery. Italy’s SMS Meer provided and installed the equipment for this production improvement.   “This will improve ArcelorMittal’s competitive edge in an important market sector,” said ArcelorMittal Zenica CEO Mr Biju Nair.   Speaking at the ceremony in Zenica, Mr Nair continued:  “The three important new investment programmes that we are announcing today represent another practical demonstration of our strong commitment to building a long term, sustainable future for steelmaking in this historic industrial city.   Mr Biju Nair addresses delegates at Friday's inauguration ceremony  “To be sustainable, we must pay attention to improving our environmental footprint, and the efficient production of high quality products that meet the expectations of our customers.

{"id":6328,"text":"The theme for this year’s Health and Safety Day, which is co-ordinated with the steel industry’s Steel Safety Day, is ’Sharing and learning from serious occurrences’. These are defined as health and safety contraventions which either did, or importantly could have resulted in severe, or even fatal injuries. Blue and white collar employees will take part not only in discussions, presentations and practical activities to help them identify and prevent unsafe situations, but also a range of health related lifestyle activities.  While many ArcelorMittal sites have been without a fatality or lost time injury for several years, the company has not yet reached its goal of zero injuries and fatalities. However, over the past 11 years the company has made considerable progress in improving safety performance, reducing its lost-time injury frequency rates (LTIFR) from 3.1 in 2007, to 0.82 in 2016. This compares favourably with a World Steel Association average of 1.2. The company is determined to further reduce health and safety occurrences in pursuit of this goal.  Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, will speak to ArcelorMittal employees and contractors around the world today about this year’s theme, pointing out that zero accidents and fatalities are possible, evidenced by the excellent records of many ArcelorMittal plants.  Commenting, he said:  “Since the foundation of ArcelorMittal more than 10 years ago, health and safety has been our number one priority. Our annual health and safety day again focusses us on that. Our aim is to eradicate all accidents, and so we must continue to identify and respond to serious occurrences and ensure the learning from them is shared across the organisation.

The most notable of these investments is the reline of the blast furnace. Completion of this project has allowed the plant a new life for the next 20 years, preserving jobs not only in the Krakow unit, but also in numerous contracting companies as well as industries related to the steel industry, such as mining, gas, energy and transport.

Transaction highlights and key details of AM Investco’s plans for Ilva include:    * Purchase price of €1.8 billion, with annual leasing costs of €180 million to be paid in quarterly installments. Ilva’s assets will be initially leased by AM Investco, with rental payments qualifying as down payments against the purchase price. Start of lease expected around year-end 2017, subject to regulatory authorisations. Lease period to be minimum of two years.   * Investments of c. €2.4 billion (c. €2.1 billion net of Riva Group contribution) over a seven-year period:   * Industrial CAPEX of c. €1.3 billion, supporting an extensive industrial plan; investment programme focussed on blast furnaces, steel shops and finishing lines   * Environmental CAPEX of c. €1.1 billion that will ensure Ilva complies with the Integrated Environmental Authorisation (AIA) as set out by the Italian Government and will materially improve Ilva’s environmental performance in areas including air emissions and water treatment; environmental CAPEX includes remediation spend of €288 million, which will be funded with funds seized by the Italian Government from the Riva Group, Ilva’s former owners; further intention to introduce breakthrough low-carbon technologies, including carbon capture and re-use, in the future; and commitment to use DRI when there are the conditions of economic sustainability coherent with the industrial plan.    * Finished steel shipments to systematically increase to 9.5 million tonnes, by 2023. Crude steel production limited to 6 million tonnes per annum until AIA provisions complied with; once achieved, commitment to restart blast furnace #5 and increase crude steel production to 8 million tonnes per annum; crude steel production to be supplemented by imported slabs and hot rolled coil, in order to maximise utilisation of Ilva’s finishing facilities, with a commitment to keep at least 10,000 employees for the entire duration of the industrial plan according to the outcome of negotiations with the unions.    * €10 million start-up investment in new research and development (R&D) centre in Taranto, which will initially focus on ensuring a successful deployment of the industrial, environment and commercial plans, while also ensuring a smooth transfer of ArcelorMittal R&D intellectual property and knowledge to enhance operationally efficiency, quality and productivity at all Ilva plants.   * The assets will be transferred to AM Investco free of long term liabilities and financial debt and includes €1 billion of net working capital.    Strategic rationale    * Ilva represents a unique opportunity to add significant value to ArcelorMittal’s European business   * Ilva is the largest, and only integrated, steelmaker in Italy. Its main production facility in Taranto is strategically well located, sitting next to one of Europe’s largest deep-water ports, hence enabling easy access to raw materials. Ilva also has significant steel finishing capacity, in Taranto, Novi Ligure and Genova   * It provides ArcelorMittal with a primary production presence in Italy, Europe’s second largest steel consuming market, and a country in which the Company currently has no primary steelmaking capacity   * Italy imports between 60 and 70% of its flat steel requirements, in part due to a decline in Ilva’s output because of numerous commercial, quality and environmental issues it has faced in the recent past; ArcelorMittal believes that, over time, Ilva’s production levels and competitiveness can be restore   * ArcelorMittal can accelerate Ilva’s turnaround through:   * Leveraging ArcelorMittal’s high-added value product range, particularly in the automotive market, and upgrading Ilva’s production facilities in order to extend and improve its product range   * Leveraging economies of scale benefits in areas including procurement   * Opportunity to benchmark against ArcelorMittal’s best performing plants and transfer knowledge and expertise to improve Ilva’s operational performance, quality and efficiency   * Leveraging ArcelorMittal’s world-class research and development offering, and rapidly deploy steelmaking process and product solutions at Ilva   * Capturing €310 million of identified synergies.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal led consortium reaches agreement regarding Ilva lease and purchase agreement","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) and Marcegaglia announce that AM Investco Italy Srl (‘AM Investco’) has concluded the exclusive negotiation phase and reached a binding agreement concerning the lease and obligation to purchase Ilva S.p.A and its subsidiaries with the Italian Government.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-led-consortium-reaches-agreement\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6345,"text":"In Florange, eastern France, €67m will be invested in a new production line for automotive steels. This project is part of the company’s strategy to have a centre of excellence for automotive steels production in the Lorraine region: Florange and Mouzon in France, and Dudelange in Luxembourg.  The investment will see the construction of a new 600,000 tonne Usibor® line in Florange, which will be operational by mid-2019 and is expected to employ 75 people of which 20 will be newly created jobs. This line will be dedicated to producing advanced high strength steels (AHSS) for the automotive industry and will replace the current electro-galvanising line.  The new line, which will be integrated with a hot strip mill and a pickling line, will be able to produce steels such as Usibor® 2000 and Ductibor® 1000 as well as a new Usibor® Ultraprotect coating. This builds on Florange’s strong reputation for Usibor®.  The line also strengthens ArcelorMittal’s position in advanced high strength steels for the automotive industry, which has been a focus of its R&D efforts. This has led to the design of Usibor® 2000, which the group is soon to produce on an industrial scale. The line will put ArcelorMittal in a strong position to meet fast-growing demand for Usibor®.  In parallel, customer demand for electrogalvanised products is shrinking, as they opt for more advanced high-strength steels. As a result, the current electro-zinc coating line in Florange has been operating below its 300,000 tonne capacity and ArcelorMittal has decided to convert this line into a Usibor® line. Demand for electrogalvanised products will be met by ArcelorMittal’s three other electrogalvanising lines within northern Europe: Marchin and Genk in Belgium and Dudelange, Luxembourg.  “This investment will mean better service for our customers thanks to our increased ability to produce advanced high strength steels, and the flexibility that this additional capacity brings. As we develop new advanced high strength steel products, we want to be in a position to produce them commercially as soon as possible and this investment puts us in a strong position to be able to do this. This is another very positive development in the recent history of ArcelorMittal in Lorraine – and Florange was the right place to make this investment, with its strategic location, with the technology it already has, and its existing infrastructure” said Wim Van Gerven, CEO of Business Division North.  Greater flexibility for high value-added products from Dunkerque  At Dunkerque, ArcelorMittal will invest €29m in the plant's steel shop, to deliver technical improvements that will provide greater flexibility for high value-added products.  The vacuum degassing unit will be modified, adding steel desulphurisation, and a better slag retention system will be installed on the converters. These projects will be operational in the fourth quarter of 2018.  These investments will increase the steel shop's ability to produce grades with very low sulphur, phosphorus and nitrogen contents, in line with the requirements of automotive customers in particular. Therefore, Usibor® 2000, awaited by customers, will go into industrial production at Dunkerque in 2019.  “These investments are wholly in line with the strategy of ArcelorMittal Atlantique & Lorraine. This is an important step in our plan to reach our performance objectives over the long term: enhanced efficiency, quality and customer service” emphasised Eric Niedziela, CEO of ArcelorMittal Atlantique & Lorraine.  Usibor® and Ductibor® -- meeting the challenges of the automotive industry  Advanced high strength steels such as Usibor and Ductibor mainly serve the automotive market. They feature in structural parts of vehicles where they enhance safety (crash behaviour) while enabling weight reduction, thus reducing fuel consumption and emissions. Usibor and Ductibor customers include a vast majority of carmakers around the world.  Florange at the cutting edge for automotive steels since 2013  In 2013, ArcelorMittal announced the launch of the first line in the world to produce extra-wide Usibor® for the automotive industry, in Florange.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal invests €96m in Florange and Dunkerque","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal is to invest €96m at its Florange and Dunkerque sites in France.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-jul-28-arcelormittal-invests-96m-in-florange-and-dunkerque\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Matthieu is currently CEO of the ArcelorMittal Gent cluster in Belgium, which shipped over 6.5 million tonnes of steel in 2016. He was originally appointed CEO of ArcelorMittal Gent in January 2014 and took responsibility for the Gent cluster, which includes ArcelorMittal’s operations in Liège, upon its creation in 2016.

Commenting, Matthieu Jehl said:  “The turnaround of Ilva is integral to the future of Italy’s manufacturing sector and I am very excited to have been tasked with this important responsibility. One of the first things I plan to do is meet stakeholders, to ensure that we understand their perspective and that they understand our plans and investment commitments, which are considerable. Having been CEO of steelmaking operations of significant scale in Belgium, I know that it is not enough to meet industrial targets – we also have to meet the expectations of our stakeholders, and certainly of the employees. In recent years Ilva has lost its licence to operate – regaining this is a clear priority and this can only be achieved through transparent, honest and regular dialogue. I have been following the situation closely for some time and am confident that Ilva will regain its position as a tier one steel producer, capable of providing Italian and European customers with the quality and service they require. The opportunities are considerable and I am looking forward to getting started.”  Samuele Pasi added:  “As an Italian native and someone who has been involved in the Ilva tender process for a number of years, I am well aware of the strategic importance of Ilva to the fabric of Italy’s manufacturing sector.   “ArcelorMittal’s credentials as the world’s leading steel company, and as a committed and trustworthy investor, became very clear to me in the advisory role I undertook for the company.

{"id":6352,"text":"The programme is designed to enable ArcelorMittal Mexico to meet the anticipated increased demand requirements from domestic customers, realise in full ArcelorMittal Mexico’s productive capacity of 5.3 million tonnes and significantly enhance the proportion of higher-value added products in its product mix, in-line with the Company’s Action 2020 strategic plan.  The main investment will be construction of a new hot strip mill. Construction will take approximately three years and, upon completion, will enable ArcelorMittal Mexico to produce c. 2.5 million tonnes of flat rolled steel. Coils from the new hot strip mill will be supplied to domestic, non-auto, general industry customers. Further investments will be made at Lázaro Cárdenas to improve the quality and productivity of the asset base, with additional investment in the group’s Mexican mining operations.  Today’s announcement follows confirmation that the Mexican government has established five Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in southern Mexico to attract infrastructure investment in areas of undeveloped economic potential. Lázaro Cárdenas, home to ArcelorMittal Mexico’s primary steelmaking operations, was named a SEZ.  Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “In order to make investment decisions of the scale we have announced today we need both a favourable investment environment and confidence in long-term domestic growth prospects. I therefore warmly welcome the confirmation of the Special Economic Zones by the Mexican government, which establishes a positive regulatory investment framework aimed at facilitating economic and infrastructure development in the south of the country. Our investment programme is aligned with the Mexican government’s objectives, and will enable us to benefit from the anticipated increased demand for higher-added value steel products from domestic Mexican customers. It reinforces our long-standing presence in Mexico, will support the creation of approximately 800 new jobs and play an important role in bolstering economic activity in the region.”  Victor Cairo, CEO, ArcelorMittal Mexico, added:  “Construction of the new hot strip mill, alongside the other projects in our investment programme which are geared towards enhancing the efficiency and quality of our operations, will enable us to optimise our asset base and increase the proportion of finished steel products for our domestic customers. The investments will help us to meet the demand requirements for higher-added value products we expect to see from domestic customers, which today are heavily dependent on imports, while continuing to support ArcelorMittal’s NAFTA operations by providing high-quality semi-finished steel slabs.”  ArcelorMittal Mexico currently produces c. 4 million tonnes of steel a year. Following completion of the investment programme, production would be optimised to c. 5.3 million tonnes per year, with the proportion of finished steel for the domestic Mexican market significantly expanded. Flat rolled steel production would total c. 2.5 million tonnes, long steel c. 1.8 million tonnes with the remaining 1 million tonnes made up of semi-finished slabs.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal announces US$1.0 billion three-year investment programme in Mexico","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces a major US$1 billion, three-year investment programme at its Mexican operations, which is focussed on building ArcelorMittal Mexico’s downstream capabilities, sustaining the competitiveness of its mining operations and modernising its existing asset base.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-announces-us-1-0-billion-three-year\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6353,"text":"The day’s activities, organised in partnership with the Museum of Metallurgy, included a tour of the plant’s facilities, exhibitions, presentations on several topics including electrical steels, industry trade, plant’s history, as well as an information stand set up by an engineering school to give insight into the applications of electrical steels.  The plant specialises in electrical steels for a number of industries, including energy (hydropower, wind, nuclear, etc.), industrial motors, consumer goods (household appliances and tools), and the automotive sector, supplying high-grade products for electric and hybrid vehicles. The plant supplies some 150 customers across the world, with 75% of the products exported, 25% out of Europe.  Investing in the future of the plant and the community  In 2013 the plant commissioned a new continuous annealing production line, an investment worth €90 million. Furthermore, in May this year, the company announced a new €5.6 million investment plan that should allow recovery and use of the heat generated in the production process. The project, done in collaboration with Kyotherm, Schneider Electric, and the town of Saint-Chély-d'Apcher, should enable the plant to save 4,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions per year, equivalent to taking 2,000 new vehicles off the road.   “We have been able to adopt a new course in recent years following the investment made in 2013. We are guided solely by our customers’ requirements and have become pioneers in Europe,\" said Gilles Hoffmann, ArcelorMittal Saint-Chély-d'Apcher plant director.   “This plant has a bright future ahead of it with the development of high-end steels for the automotive industry,” said Bernard Dehut, ArcelorMittal Méditerranée CEO.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Saint-Chély-d'Apcher celebrates a century of steelmaking excellence","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Saint-Chély-d'Apcher, France, celebrated 100 years of operations at an open day event held on 23 September and attended by more than 2,700 guests.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-sep-28-saint-chely-d-apcher-celebrates-a-century-of-steelmaking-excellence\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6354,"text":"ArcelorMittal Tubarão, Brazil, has won the worldsteel Steelie Award in the ‘Excellence in Sustainability’ category for its efforts to pave rural roads in Brazil using steel by-products.  The ‘Excellence in sustainability’ award acknowledges the sustainability initiative which has made the greatest contribution to all three areas of sustainability – economic, environmental and social value. The winners of the 8th Steelie Awards were announced at the Annual Dinner of the World Steel Association (worldsteel) on 16 October.  Tubarão’s accolade-winning project is a result of ArcelorMittal R&D department’s ground breaking work on developing REVSOL® and REVSOL Plus®, products which turn steel slag into a primary road, car park and storage yard coating, replacing the use of non-renewable sources in road building and significantly reducing the need for road maintenance and the costs associated with it.   Paving what had been dirt roads has also improved access to services such as garbage collection, ambulances, and police for 30 municipalities in the state of Espirito Santo over a 200km radius. It has reduced maintenance costs for the vehicles which use these better-quality roads and has speeded up delivery of local produce, improving the quality of life for local people, and achieving better prices for small farmers whose produce is fresher and more saleable when it reaches consumers.  ArcelorMittal Acindar, Argentina, was shortlisted in the same category, for a project which built a secure breeding centre for the conservation of jaguars out of reused steel.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Two awards in two days for ArcelorMittal","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal takes home the ‘Excellence in Sustainability’ Steelie Award from worldsteel; silver in ‘Best online annual report’ category at the 2017 Digital Impact Awards","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-oct-18-two-awards-in-two-days-for-arcelormittal\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6359,"text":"Speaking at the company's Europe media day in Paris today, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe and group CFO, said:  \"2017 has been a milestone year for digitalisation within the company. While the company has had a digital focus for a number of years, benefiting customers in particular, ArcelorMittal is today making major investments, not only in terms of resources but also in time and in management attention, to remain at the forefront of digitalisation in the steel industry\".  Explaining at the company's Europe media day why the opportunities from digitalisation and Industry 4.0 are so rapidly accelerating, Wim Van Gerven, management committee member responsible for digital transformation for industry, and CEO of business division north, ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, explained:  \"ArcelorMittal isn't new to digitalisation, commercial or industrial. We've been deploying it for years to improve our processes: our assets are already highly automated and in many cases, connected. But the pace of change is what's new, we're no longer having to wait two to three years for prototypes to be developed and tested - it's happening in a matter of months\".  Changes such as the affordability of sensors – which are used in their thousands through ArcelorMittal's plants - and the ability to use big data to process huge volumes of data generated from sensors, are creating possibilities that did not exist two years ago.  Creating centres of excellence across Europe  Recognising the benefits of collaboration on such projects, the company has created centres of digital excellence in Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Poland and Spain, where new technologies are developed from prototype to maturity:  \"Today, if you go to our facilities around the world, especially in Europe, you will see small clusters of people working together in finding solutions. To imagine a steel company of this size, to be addressing these challenges in a start-up style, is quite exciting. Most people who join the steel business would not expect to have such opportunities at ArcelorMittal. This is exciting for existing employees as well as for new employees\" said Aditya Mittal.  Earlier this month, ArcelorMittal Poland announced the creation of ArcelorMittal Poland Research & Innovation, to lead and encourage multi-functional teams to launch new digitalisation and Industry 4.0 initiatives, with a focus on competitiveness and industry leadership.  ArcelorMittal's R&D centre in Avilés, Spain – recently renamed the Global R&D Aviles Innovation Island Centre - is one of the principal centres of excellence for digitalisation and Industry 4.0 within the ArcelorMittal group. The group's engineers, scientists and analysts based in the centre focus on the development of breakthrough technologies.  As an extension of its certified SAP Centre of Excellence in Luxembourg, ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products has decided to create in Olaberria, Spain, a small Digital Competence Centre, working with the new agile methodologies and cloud technologies (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure), helping the business around web and mobile services.  In ArcelorMittal Gent, Belgium, more than 100 engineers have teamed up to work on accelerating the plant's automation projects, and to support on rolling out the technology across the group. In addition, a team of 70 systems and modelling experts has been formed, with engineers from across ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products' industrial sites working together.  In France, ArcelorMittal's Downstream Solutions business is creating a digital headquarters, with a small, start-up team of digital specialists based in the company's Distribution Solutions headquarters in Reims, France. The team has worked on initiatives including the company's first online steel shop.  On the commercial side of the business, a small team of data scientists has been hired in Luxembourg to further drive commercial digitalisation initiatives, in addition to the 20-strong team that has been implementing digital transformation for customers for a number of years.  ArcelorMittal is also working with leading universities in Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, the UK and USA to capture the best academic expertise and implement new ideas in the business.  For example, In Luxembourg, ArcelorMittal Europe - Long Products' R&D team is working with the Luxembourg Institute for Science and Technology.  It has also established partnerships with a number of start-up companies, working on topics including additive manufacturing, big data analytics and manufacturing intelligence.  Digitalisation drivers  The main driver for digitalisation at ArcelorMittal is competitive advantage, with new technologies helping to ensure:    * customers' product needs can be met straight away, for example through the company's 'virtual mill' which connects all Flat Products mills, systems, and order books, to removes all boundaries, whether geographical or technical.   * the best product quality, through better prediction using advanced analytics made possible through big data and distributed computing. This means production issues can be detected before they happen, allowing the early detection of defects.   * cost efficiency in production and logistics. For example, the company's R&D sites in Avilés, Spain has developed a unique, breakthrough technology for line scheduling – inspired by studying and mimicking the movements in ant colonies - that has significantly improved productivity. And the deployment of automated stockyards, linked to line scheduling and transport devices such as autonomous cranes means less stock is needed, and lead times are cut: two major supply chain benefits.    Driving the change  Customers are also driving change within ArcelorMittal's plants, for example with digital twinning. Digital twinning involves building virtual models of physical assets or manufacturing processes that continually learn and provide data insights.  On its production lines that supply the automotive industry, ArcelorMittal uses digital twinning to create a digital fingerprint of a coil that's scheduled for delivery.  Quality defects are marked with a barcode on the coil and linked to a digital twin of the coil in the cloud.  Customers can then automatically scan the bar codes when the coil arrives, access the quality data from the cloud and optimise their operations with the knowledge downloaded from the bar code.  By knowing where the issues with the coil are in advance, this helps to eliminate waste and optimize productivity for both supplier and customer.  The benefits of a large-scale company  While the implementation of such large-scale digital and industry 4.0 projects is challenging in a company of ArcelorMittal's size, once implemented these projects bring major benefits and value exactly because of the company's scale and complexity:  \"Digitalisation at the world's largest steel and mining company isn't straightforward, but once we harness the volumes of data generated by our plants, we stand to make a huge leap in terms of the benefits of digitalisation for our manufacturing processes, and for our customers\" said Wim Van Gerven.  Cultural change  Recognising the scale of the cultural change taking place as a result of the focus on digitalisation, Wim Van Gerven also spoke about the company's human resources strategy for developing employees' skills in this respect:  \"Cultural change within the company is as important as the digital changes themselves – digital transformation is a process that impacts the entire company and we are acutely aware of the need to ensure cultural change in our workforce, in order for our employees to have the right mindset to help ensure our digital ambitions are fully realized\", he explained.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe leads the future of steel with digitalisation investments and centres of excellence for new technology","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe is investing in digitalisation throughout its business - in a year when rapid developments in technology have reached a tipping point.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-nov-28-arcelormittal-europe-leads-the-future-of-steel\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6361,"text":"By collaborating with internal experts, those from academia and its customers, ArcelorMittal is finding ways to make transformational changes to the way it does business, as it seeks to achieve its ambition of becoming a zero-waste company. Some of the ways it is doing this, acknowledged by the commendation, include:    * Partnering with technical and industry leaders to develop and scale up ground-breaking carbon capture and utilisation technology, resulting in products like Steelanol, a bio-fuel made from waste carbon monoxide, with the help of microbes. This high-grade ethanol will then be used for transportation and to make plastics. The company anticipates Steelanol could create 2000 direct and indirect jobs and generate an income of 300 million euro a year by 2025, while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions – 5 million tonnes worth a year by 2025.   * Manufacturing ECOCEM, a low carbon cement, from its slag and selling it directly to customers. In France alone, this practice has already reduced the cement industry’s CO2 emissions by nearly two million tonnes, and from 2018 onwards it is projected to further reduce those emissions by a further one million tonnes a year. Selling this by-product generates over 100 million euro in revenue each year.   * Paving more than 650 km of country roads across 20 Brazilian municipalities with over 1.5 million tonnes of Revsol and Revsol Plus. These products, made from slag, a by-product of the steelmaking process, replace natural non-renewable resources such as gravel.   * Allocating additional resources to detailed life cycle assessment of its products and developing a new sustainability assessment tool.   * Designing innovative processes and products to maximise efficiency and minimise waste in its own production and those of its customers.   * Stretching product lifecycles by leasing sheet piles for short term projects, rather than selling them – and then leasing them again. The company’s comparative studies show reusing sheet piles has 86% less global warming potential than permanent steel sheet piles and 90% less global warming potential than a concrete retaining wall.   Similarly, through the circular building, exhibited at the London Design Festival 2016, the company demonstrated the concept of steel reuse for entire steel structures, given they are designed, dismantled and reused with the circular economy in mind.   * Torrefing waste wood and using it to replace coal in its blast furnaces, harnessing and using energy that would otherwise have been lost. In doing so, the company expects to recycle two to four million tonnes of waste wood each year by 2025, saving it approximately 100 million euro a year.   * The Circulars 2018, an initiative of The World Economic Forum and The Forum of Young Global Leaders, run in collaboration with Accenture Strategy and given at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos. The award recognises individuals and organisations from around the world who are making notable contributions to the circular economy.    Alan Knight, General manager, head of corporate responsibility and sustainable development said, “Being highly commended by the Circulars 2018, is a fantastic achievement and highlights how far we have come as a steel company to change not only the way we do things, but also the way we are perceived as a corporate citizen. We have long talked about the value steel brings to people’s lives and its unparalleled recyclability, but now we are finding ways to take those ideas further and become a zero-waste company by integrating circular economy principles into everything we do.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal gets nod from World Economic Forum for integrating circular economy principles into its business model","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"The world’s most prestigious award programme for the circular economy, The Circulars, has highly commended ArcelorMittal for demonstrating leadership and innovation by applying circular economy principles to its business models.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-dec-7-arcelormittal-gets-nod-from-world-economic-forum\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6363,"text":"The ambitious winning design - which was unveiled in Kirchberg, Luxembourg today - is primarily steel and glass, and will showcase the diverse benefits of steel over other building materials* in addition to highlighting the use of steel in ‘green’, sustainable construction. As well as being ArcelorMittal’s headquarters, housing around 800 employees, some of the space will be leased for other uses. There will also be a restaurant, sports facility and a 200-seat auditorium available to the public.  W&A’s design responds to a detailed brief to design a modern, sustainable building that harnesses all the potential of steel from top to bottom. The result is a truly unique building that includes numerous design firsts, including innovative new products and features that are the result of a close collaboration between the designer and ArcelorMittal’s research and development teams. Technical innovations include:    * A fluid and flexible ground floor space featuring no columns, a feature that is only possible with steel due to the use of a suspended steel exoskeleton   * An integrated flooring system fully designed in steel which removes the need for false ceilings, resulting in high quality acoustics and improved aesthetics   * A curtain wall completely designed in steel which results in a lighter, more airy building due to steel’s higher strength and superior elasticity   * New section bars adapted from products designed for the automotive sector    The W&A design also responds to ArcelorMittal’s desire to have a sustainable building that promotes steel’s contribution to the circular economy. The building follows the “cradle-to-cradle” concept, meaning that it can be dismantled and nearly all the steel products re-used in a new building without the need for recycling.  The building is also a low-carbon, energy-efficient building and will be “BREEAM outstanding,” “DGNB Gold,” and “BBCA” certified. Environmental credentials include solar power generation – featuring 4000 square metres of ArcelorMIttal steel photo voltaic cells on the roof - rain water management, and automatic window opening for natural ventilation. It also features a bioclimatic public atrium, ventilated by a Canadian well system, which naturally cools the air in summer and heats it in winter. The atrium is designed to evoke the Luxembourg countryside and will feature trees and plants in a woodland style that will bring additional environmental benefits, acting as a buffer for the temperature. Further green space will be created by setting the building back from the limit of the plot, creating new outdoor public spaces. The building will also be certified by a Gold level “WELL” label. All of these features will serve to underpin ArcelorMittal’s commitment to sustainable development (SD) as encapsulated in our 10 SD outcomes, which are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Today’s announcement demonstrates in particular our commitment to creating sustainable infrastructure, our SD outcome 3 (aligned with SDG 11), and our determination to become a responsible energy user that contributes to a low carbon future – our SD outcome 6 (aligned with SDG 13).  Speaking in Luxembourg at an event to announce the winner, Aditya Mittal, chairman of the jury, said: “Taking the decision to invest in a new headquarters shows ArcelorMittal’s long-term commitment to Luxembourg. As the world’s leading steel company, it is also a great opportunity to have a new headquarters that showcases the flexibility, creativity and sustainability of steel as a construction material. All the architects that participated in the competition submitted interesting designs and on behalf of my colleagues on the jury, I would like to thank them all for their creativity. Ultimately though we could only select one project and W&A stood out for their complete respect of every aspect of our brief, including practicality, aesthetics, economics and sustainability, as well as their enthusiastic engagement with our R&D team. They have developed a truly innovative design. What I personally love is that this building shows the beauty of steel, which is so often hidden from view. In fact, we believe that no other building of this size and scale has been designed specifically to feature steel throughout. And, equally important, it will be a great place to work for our employees, a fantastic platform to show our customers what steel can do and an exceptional open space for visitors to this part of the city.”  Jean-Michel Wilmotte, Architect, President of W&A, said: “To be asked to design a new steel-based headquarters for the world’s leading steel company is an important commission. I love working with steel and am confident that we have developed a design that will showcase the very best of the material. I am particularly excited about the ambition of the building, which is to show how creativity, coupled with modern techniques, can advance the sustainability, economics, and practicality of modern office building design and so improve the lives of those who work and interact with it. I hope that the employees of ArcelorMittal will be proud of the building and will enjoy coming to work there for many years and decades to come.”  Michel Wurth, President of ArcelorMittal Luxembourg, added: “As a Luxemburger, I’m proud and excited that such a forward-thinking design will be built here largely with steel made in Luxembourg. Our steel features in so many iconic buildings around the world, it’s great to have an opportunity to create another one here in our home country. I believe W&A’s design fully captures the atmosphere of tomorrow which is appropriate for ArcelorMittal as a company on the cutting edge of its industry and will also provide a great place for our employees to work. It will be a new addition to the Kirchberg plateau and of course we will work closely work with the municipality of Luxembourg during the planning phase to fully integrate this new building into the already iconic urban landscape and skyline.“  The consultation was initiated in February 2017 following ArcelorMittal’s decision in April 2016 to build a new head office in Luxembourg. ArcelorMittal is the principal industrial employer of the Grand Duchy with over 4,000 employees. The construction of a new, landmark headquarters building illustrates the Group’s commitment to maintaining its presence in the country, where the company has not only its head offices, but also seven industrial sites producing or processing steel, and developing steel solutions for the construction, automotive, general industry and agriculture sectors of the economy.  In the first phase, eight internationally renowned practices were invited to submit initial designs on April 27 and 28. Bernard Tschumi Architects, Foster + Partners, JSWD Architekten, Massimiliano Fuksas Architecture, Rafael Vinoly Architects, Rem Koolhaas OMA, Von Gerkan, Marg and Partners and Wilmotte & Associés were the architects included. In the second phase, three shortlisted practices – Foster + Partners, Rem Koolhaas OMA, and Wilmotte & Associés - were asked to develop a more advanced architectural design. These were then submitted to the jury which evaluated the proposals and then recommended Wilmotte & Associés to ArcelorMittal and to the Board of Fonds Kirchberg as the selected winner.  Groundbreaking is expected during the summer of 2019 with completion in the last quarter of 2021  *This includes the ability to include additional storeys without compromising ceiling height, due to reduced floor thicknesses; fewer internal columns due to the strength of the most modern steel beams, permitting more flexible internal layouts; and, due to the lighter weight of steel buildings as opposed to those using conventional materials, less deep foundations, bringing timing and cost benefits. Use of steel also brings efficiency to site operations given that even the most complex forms are pre-fabricated off site and only come to site for assembly. Compared to traditional construction methods, this saves time and manpower on site, and lessens road congestion caused by deliveries.

CAD$30 million) and its Contrecoeur-West bar mill (approx. CAD$33 million). These new furnaces, which aim to increase the company's rolling capacity by 100,000 tonnes, will enable greater productivity, optimal energy use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The work should extend until the first half of 2020.   * At the same time, ArcelorMittal will be replacing the dust collector at the Contrecoeur-West steelworks by the end of 2018 to improve its performance and increase health and safety for the benefit of our workers and our communities. The work will cost approximately CAD$6 million.     The investments were made possible in part by the Québec government’s electricity rebate programme for L-rate customers, announced by the Government of Quebec in the 2016-2017 Budget. This electricity rebate is intended for companies engaging in major investment projects in the manufacturing sector as well as in the transformation of natural resources. ArcelorMittal investment project rebate is currently estimated at CAD$25 million until 2020.   In addition to these announcements, ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada has also invested CAD$27 million in a new finishing line at its Longueuil mill, a project which was completed in June 2017. Past and future work requires support from many suppliers and subcontractors, mostly from local communities, which adds economic benefits.   François Perras, Chief Executive Officer, ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada, said:  “We are renewing ArcelorMittal’s commitment to Quebec. Our choice to invest in the acquisition of high-performance equipment will help us accelerate our move towards high-value-added steel production, particularly for the automotive and construction industries. ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada will also be in a better position to meet its customers’ needs and face international competition. Our workers’ ongoing efforts and government support have been instrumental in this investment decision. With this modernisation plan, we will continue to play a major role in our communities by supporting more than 1,700 direct jobs and converting our natural resources right here in Quebec.”   Dominique Anglade, Deputy Premier, Minister of Economy, Science and Innovation and Minister responsible for the digital strategy, said:  “The innovative manufacturing sector is one of the three economic pillars that our government is prioritising, along with entrepreneurship and exports. We are, therefore, proud to support the initiatives of large businesses established in Québec which, through major investments, are carrying out innovative projects and adopting new technologies in their manufacturing approaches and procedures. Innovation and modernisation are synonymous with growth for businesses and are key levers for Québec’s prosperity.”  Carlos J. Leitão, Minister of Finance, said:  “Québec’s stable business environment, recognised expertise in a number of leading-edge sectors and abundant natural resources make it the ideal place to invest. Today’s announcement clearly demonstrates ArcelorMittal’s interest in expanding its operations in Québec. The confirmation of these strategic investments will bolster and diversify our economy in several of Québec’s regions.”  Image: ArcelorMittal's wire rod mill in Contrecoeur, Quebec  Images for media use: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2DpiJh6  About ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada  ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada’s (http:\/\/long-canada.arcelormittal.com) mission is to safely manufacture sustainable steel in accordance with its values of health and safety, quality, leadership and sustainability.

It also highlights the extensive experience and track record of the group in the successful acquisition and integration of under-performing assets, which AMIPL believes would be of considerable value to Essar. Essar would also have access to the deep bench of technical expertise and knowledge from across the group which is unparalleled in the steel industry.  Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Essar provides a compelling opportunity for ArcelorMittal to enter the high growth Indian steel market. The offer submitted today by AMIPL includes a detailed investment plan to address operational issues in Essar’s existing asset base.

{"id":6372,"text":"The Company’s subsidiary ArcelorMittal India Private Limited (AMIPL) submitted a Resolution Plan for Essar on 12 February, which outlined the intention to have NSSMC formally join its bid for Essar Steel. Should the submitted Resolution Plan be selected and formally accepted by India’s National Company Law Tribunal, ArcelorMittal and NSSMC would jointly acquire and manage Essar Steel.  In its Resolution Plan, AMIPL set out a detailed industrial and turnaround plan aimed at restoring Essar Steel’s fortunes, enabling it to realise its full potential and participate in the anticipated steel demand growth in India.   Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Partnering with NSSMC for Essar Steel was always our intention and adds further strength to our offer. Combining our experience and expertise creates a powerful partnership that has a proven track record - our rich history of positive collaboration dates back more than 20 years with three joint ventures in the US. We believe that together we can contribute our knowledge and technology to support a rapid turn-around in Essar’s performance, enabling it to increase production, enhance its product capabilities and make a meaningful contribution to the future growth of India’s manufacturing sector and the development of its economy.”  ArcelorMittal and NSSMC have operated I\/N Tek and I\/N Kote in Indiana, USA, under joint venture agreements since 1987. I\/N Tek and I\/N Kote are high-added value downstream steel finishing facilities which serve the automotive and domestic appliance markets.  More recently, in 2014, ArcelorMittal partnered with NSSMC on the acquisition of AM\/NS Calvert, a state-of-the art downstream finishing facility in Alabama, USA. The facility, which opened in 2010 and has a 5.3 million tonne capacity, was the largest newly constructed steel facility in the US in 40 years but had failed to reach its potential. A major investment programme has been undertaken following the acquisition. The programme focussed on improving the facility’s finishing lines to enable the production of higher-added value steel products, including production of Usibor®, ArcelorMittal’s flagship advanced high-strength steel for the automotive sector, and increasing slab staging capacity and efficiency. These investments have helped to facilitate a rapid improvement in AM\/NS Calvert’s performance: capacity utilisation rates have improved by over 20 per cent; shipments to the automotive sector more than doubled between 2015 and 2017; and productivity at the hot strip mill has increased by over 1 million tonnes since the acquisition.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2018-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Agreement between ArcelorMittal and NSSMC regarding joint venture to acquire Essar Steel India Limited","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (The Company) has signed a joint venture formation agreement with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (NSSMC) in relation to its offer to acquire Essar Steel India Limited (Essar Steel).","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/agreement-between-arcelormittal-and-nssmc\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6377,"text":"NSSMC is Japan’s leading steel company, with capacity to produce approximately 50 million tons of crude steel per year with a reputation for innovation and high-quality products. ArcelorMittal and NSSMC have enjoyed a close collaboration for many decades co-operating high-quality downstream finishing facilities in the US including I\/N Tek, I\/N Kote and, since 2014, jointly acquired and turned around AM\/NS Calvert which has state-of-the-art facilities in Alabama that had failed to reach its potential under its previous owner.  Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO ArcelorMittal, said:  “The aim of the resolution process is to find a strong, new, capable owner for Essar Steel and maximize returns to creditors. We believe that ArcelorMittal, together with NSSMC, has the most relevant credentials and experience and is the most credible owner for Essar Steel given our decades of steel industry expertise, backed up by industry leading research and development and a wide range of innovative product capabilities.  “We are confident we are eligible; we are confident we have the strongest track record; and we are confident we have made a strong and competitive offer. At the heart of this offer is a compelling industrial plan that enhances and transforms the asset. The plant in Hazira is a big integrated steel-making facility that requires dedicated knowledge and technological expertise to de-bottleneck, grow and enhance its product portfolio. We plan to commit significant capital expenditure to grow the asset, inject our proprietorial patents and processes and bring new high-quality products for industries such as automotive and solar to India.  “India has an ambitious goal to transform its economy and deliver a better standard of living for all its people. Developing its manufacturing industry is an important component of this journey as exemplified by the government’s plan to expand the country’s steelmaking capacity to 300 million tons. Supported by the right know-how and technology, Essar Steel is well positioned to play a part in this. Given our Indian heritage we would be proud to contribute to the country’s future prosperity.”  Mr. Kosei Shindo, President of NSSMC, said:  “India is the most promising steel market in the world, and NSSMC has been seeking opportunities to establish a significant presence in India, motivated by a long and successful history of respect and collaboration between Japan and India. This project, if implemented, will be consistent with the policy of the Japanese Government to further strengthen the relationship between India and Japan. The Japanese Government has been following the project and is looking for its realization.  “Essar Steel is a good asset with a lot of potential and I believe that NSSMC and ArcelorMittal could provide operational experience and access to the best of global technologies that will enable Essar Steel to reach its potential and greatly contribute to the turnaround of the Indian steel manufacturing sector. We believe NSSMC, together with ArcelorMittal, could help India achieve the National Steel Policy as well as the Make-in-India policy, as we have long been contributing to localization of steel production in other countries such as Brazil, USA, and many ASEAN countries by direct investment.  “I believe that the partnership between NSSMC and ArcelorMittal will provide important economic returns to Essar Steel’s creditor banks, while substantially enhancing the prospects for a sustainable turnaround plan for Essar Steel and its employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders.”  AMIPL first submitted a bid for Essar Steel on 12th February.

{"id":6389,"text":"If proved successful, the new concept has the potential to revolutionise blast furnace carbon emissions capture and support the decarbonisation of the transport sector.  The technology in the gas conversion process was pioneered by Chicago-based company, LanzaTech, with whom ArcelorMittal has entered a long-term partnership. The technology licensed by LanzaTech uses microbes that feed on carbon monoxide to produce bioethanol. The bioethanol will be used as transport fuel or potentially in the production of plastics.  This is the first installation of its kind on an industrial scale in Europe and once complete, annual production of bioethanol at Ghent is expected to reach around 80 million litres, which will yield an annual CO2 saving equivalent to putting 100,000 electrical cars on the road. The new installation will create up to 500 construction jobs over the next two years and 20 to 30 new permanent direct jobs. Commissioning and first production is expected by mid-2020.  The application of this microbial gas conversion system significantly advances ArcelorMittal’s carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) capabilities and enhances steel’s role in the circular economy. ArcelorMittal’s long-term aspiration is to become a zero-waste business, with all materials used or generated during steel production recuperated, treated and reused in the production chain or becoming the raw materials for other industries.  \"This new Carbon Smart technology illustrates ArcelorMittal’s commitment to transforming steel production and it will also further strengthen steel’s standing in the circular economy, particularly compared to other higher carbon metals like aluminium.”  \"We are excited that after several years of research and engineering, we are now progressing with the largest project of its kind within the ArcelorMittal group. This is the first application of a viable new business case where re-use of carbon is possible at large scale. We will achieve significant carbon reduction and we hope that this will lead us to a lower carbon economy,\" says Carl De Maré, vice president of Technology Strategy at ArcelorMittal.  \"Single use carbon must become a thing of the past,” said Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech. “In order to succeed in decarbonizing our economy, we will need the commitment of large companies and governments from around the world to ensure carbon reuse is part of the solution.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2018-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal and LanzaTech break ground on €150million project to revolutionise blast furnace carbon emissions capture","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal has begun construction of new premises at its site in Ghent, Belgium, to house a pioneering new installation which will convert carbon-containing gas from its blast furnaces into bioethanol.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2018-jun-11-arcelormittal-and-lanzatech-break-ground-on-150million-project\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6390,"text":"Known as Steligence®, the concept revolves around the idea of buildings as holistic entities where all aspects of design are considered in an integrated way, as part of the whole. As such, it proposes the need for better dialogue between various specialist architectural and engineering disciplines, recognizing not only specialist expertise, but also the need for enhanced co-operation between experts. Steligence® further suggests that the use of best available technology in steelmaking, as well as modularization of steel components in buildings where possible, has the capacity to generate efficiency gains in the design, construction and configurability of buildings as compared to those using traditional construction methods.  Additionally, because steel is infinitely recyclable, Steligence® sets the stage for architects to consider the life-cycle, recyclability and, ultimately, re-usability of a building and its components at the earliest point in the design process.  This new approach to construction from ArcelorMittal has been brought about by real advances in technology which now make steel an even more attractive material for construction than was previously the case. As such, the Steligence® concept has the potential to drive significant architectural and sustainability benefits.  These benefits include more building storeys within a given height than is the case with traditional building systems and materials; less deep and therefore less costly foundations due to the lower weight of steel buildings compared with traditional materials; and far longer uninterrupted spans between columns, resulting in much better flexibility of interior floor layout.  In addition, buildings designed using the Steligence® philosophy will be easier to assemble (and potentially disassemble) and therefore quicker to build, leading to significant efficiencies and cost savings for the construction sector.  While steel’s infinite recyclability potential is clearly superior to that of alternative materials, even then there are associated costs given the energy necessary to melt and re-form. In this context, design where possible using modular steel components can enable re-use rather than re-cycling of steel components in new buildings at the end of life of the original building. This ‘re-use’ possibility gives steel a huge advantage over traditional building materials, particularly as regulations strengthen regarding the sustainability credentials of buildings.  Steel already plays a big role in the circular economy. Steligence® will enable the construction industry and buildings themselves to play an even more significant role in it.  Speaking at a launch event in London, Greg Ludkovsky, ArcelorMittal’s global head of research and development, said: “As climate, energy and resource scarcity intensifies, win-win solutions like Steligence® become imperative for business and society at large. Buildings play a huge part in all our lives, so creating a construction concept that improves their social, economic and environmental impact while dramatically enhancing their functionality and aesthetics has been a huge but important challenge.”  “Steligence® is the culmination of several years’ intensive scientific, independent peer reviewed research to develop specific-use steel for the construction industry. By combining this R&D with extensive consultation of leading players in the construction industry, we have landed on a radical new approach to construction which is underpinned by a clear philosophy: to build a sustainable business around a sustainable construction industry that delivers for future generations.”  Notes to editors: Ten key benefits of the Steligence concept  Economic    * Optimal space and height. Use of the Angelina™ beam and CofraPlus 60 compact floor enables greatly reduced building height resulting in average 11% cost savings across façade, stairs and core elements.   * Lighter weight foundations. Steel foundation solutions, less than half the weight of equivalent structures, can result in an average 39% foundation cost saving, like-for-like.   * More flexible office space. Using the Angelina™ beam, un-interrupted spans of up to 13m can be achieved. Consequent reduction in columns allows easy reconfiguration of office space and therefore increased rental value.   * Speed of construction. Best in class steel solutions using 13m spans can be erected up to twice as fast as concrete equivalents in 8m and 5m spans resulting in up to 24% construction costs saving.   * Cost of ownership. Total costs of building ownership, taking into account all economic benefits, are at least 15% less than those constructed using alternative materials, when all components of the concept are applied.    Environmental    * Lower environmental impact. With comparatively low environmental impacts and higher recycling rates than other building materials, steel is the first choice for sustainable construction. Steel enableS access to the green building market with consequent increase in property value.   * Sustainability ratings. Buildings using ArcelorMittal steel solutions attain higher levels of certification in building rating schemes such as BREEAM and LEED than those built with traditional materials.    Social    * Improved comfort. Steel buildings provide a more comfortable environment for building users due to optimised thermal behaviour during warm weather.   * Site traffic. Steel requires fewer site deliveries than comparative materials, resulting in less traffic congestion and so reduced impact on the urban environment.   * Creativity. Steel cladding solutions offer an unparalleled choice of creative, attractive finishes, adding materially to the urban landscape.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2018-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal launches Steligence®, a radical and disruptive construction industry concept","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal has unveiled a radical new concept for the use of steel in construction, which will facilitate the next generation of high performance buildings and construction techniques and create a more sustainable life-cycle for buildings.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2018-jun-19-arcelormittal-launches-steligence\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Accordingly, if the Maximum Tender Cap is reached in respect of tenders made at or prior to the Early Tender Time, no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time will be accepted for purchase (irrespective of their priority level).  This announcement does not contain the full terms and conditions of the Offers, which are contained in the offer to purchase dated August 7, 2018 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Offer to Purchase”), and is subject to the offer restrictions set out below and more fully described in the Offer to Purchase.  Notes may be validly tendered at any time on or before 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on September 4, 2018, unless extended (as may be extended, the “Expiration Time”). Notes must be tendered in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Offer to Purchase. To receive the Total Consideration (as defined herein), plus any Accrued Interest, Holders must tender their Notes prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 20, 2018, unless extended (such time, as the same may be extended, the “Early Tender Time”). The “Total Consideration” is the U.S. dollar amount payable per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes set forth in the table above and includes an early tender premium of $50 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (the “Early Tender Premium”).

Subject to applicable law, the Company expressly reserves the right, but is not obligated to, increase the Maximum Tender Cap in its sole and absolute discretion without extending the Early Tender Time, the Withdrawal Deadline (as defined below) or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights.  Subject to the Maximum Tender Cap and the proration arrangements applicable to the Offers, all Notes of a Series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Time having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any tendered Notes of a Series having a lower Acceptance Priority Level.

As such, Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time will be accepted for purchase in priority to Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time, and to the extent that Notes are tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time, the Maximum Tender Cap available after the Early Tender Time could be reduced significantly or altogether. Accordingly, if the Maximum Tender Cap is reached in respect of tenders made at or prior to the Early Tender Time, no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time will be accepted for purchase (irrespective of their priority level).

{"id":6397,"text":"Two 81-tonne turbines, made in Japan, and shipped in containers 4.5m wide; 5m high and 8m long are being assembled before being mounted to modernised blast furnaces operating in Dąbrowa Górnicza, Poland. The turbines will increase the amount of energy the power plant generates, at no extra cost and without emissions.  Producing electricity using TRT technology is as sustainable as wind power, but much more efficient. The two new TRTs’ total capacity of 25 MW, is roughly equivalent to the output of eight to ten land-based wind turbines. To produce the same amount of energy from coal, it would be necessary to burn 52,000 tonnes of it annually, or 900 wagons worth. The associated emissions would amount to 90 tonnes of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and nine tonnes of dust.  TRT technology uses high-pressure gases (known as flue gases) which collect at the top of the blast furnace to drive very efficient electricity generators. The TRT turbine generates energy by exploiting a known property of all gases – that they expand as their pressure drops. Dry and wet scrubbing is used to remove fine particulates from the flue gas as it leaves the blast furnace. At this point, the pressure is between 2.0 and 2.2 bar. After the scrubbing process the gas pressure needs to be reduced to 0.15 bar in the septum valve for further combustion in gas boilers. The most energy efficient way to do this is to lead the gas through the turbine instead of the septum valve to drive a generator to produce electricity.   TRTs have no impact on blast furnace operations and the flue gas is not consumed. As blast furnace gas is very combustible, it is normally used in other parts of the plant to generate heat or energy for other processes. With the TRT system installed, the flue gas effectively generates energy twice – once in the turbine and again when it is burnt for its usual purpose.  “Until now, the TAMEH power plant produced energy out of blast furnace gas, but only after reducing its pressure. Now, where we used to reduce that pressure, we will install the TRTs, which will be powered by the compressed blast furnace gas to produce energy that would otherwise have been lost,” explains Artur Łój, project manager in the Investment Office, TAMEH Polska.  “After completing assembly of the TRTs, it will be necessary to install the generators, pipelines, and connect the turbines to the blast furnace gas installation. We have aligned our assembly dates to blast furnace operation schedules to take advantage of planned standstills to avoid disturbing work flows,” Artur Łój explains.  The investment, to be finalised this year, is worth over PLN 100 million. The project’s general contractor is a consortium comprised of Primetals and Eko Energia from Kraków. Many companies from the region are also involved in the project, with about 100 people working at the construction site each day.  Implementing TRT is part of ArcelorMittal’s ongoing commitment to research and developmental improvements to its processes to ensure technological superiority in the use of energy and raw materials. This reduces manufacturing costs, improves quality and minimises the company's environmental impact. TRT also provides ArcelorMittal with security over the sustainability of its long-term energy supply, and reduces its exposure to rising energy prices.  TAMEH HOLDING (TAURON ArcelorMittal Energy Holding) Is a joint venture between TAURON Group and ArcelorMittal Group, where each company holds 50% of the shares.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2018-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Turbines to produce clean energy at TAMEH power plant","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"For the first time in Poland, two top pressure recovery turbines (TRT) will be reusing high pressure flue gas from the top of the blast furnace to reduce ArcelorMittal’s carbon footprint – and its energy bill, while producing emission-free energy for TAMEH power plant in Dąbrowa Górnicza.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2018-aug-8-turbines-to-produce-clean-energy-at-tameh-power-plant\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["unsure"]}
{"id":6398,"text":"The investment will see the construction of a new continuous annealing line and a third galvanisation line for the production of cold rolled and galvanised products. The capacity of the unit is set to increase by 700,000 tonnes to a total of 2.1 million tonnes per year. The production is expected to begin in 2021.   The project will increase production for the automotive, construction and home appliances sectors at the Vega unit, allowing the company to meet the market expectations and provide high strength and quality steel products.  This investment is expected to sustain ArcelorMittal’s growth strategy in Brazil and Latin America.  “We expect the automotive industry to have a substantial increase in the utilisation rate. At the outset of the crisis, automakers were practically operating to serve the Brazilian and Argentinian markets only. The crisis forced automakers to develop alternative markets”, says Benjamin Baptista Filho, President of ArcelorMittal Brazil and CEO ArcelorMittal Flat Carbon South America.   Vega’s expansion project was on hold since 2011 due to the global crisis which started in 2009 and the Brazilian economic recession and reduction of the domestic market for vehicles. Today, 50% of the production at ArcelorMittal Vega is aimed at the automotive market. “We currently have a market to sell Vega’s products above the existing capacity.

{"id":6404,"text":"The VTC buzzed with excitement as apprentices and staff prepared to welcome the vice president of Liberia, distinguished government officials and ArcelorMittal Liberia’s senior management for the official launch of the centre. ArcelorMittal Liberia recognised an opportunity to empower youth, align education, workforce and economic development for a prosperous Liberia and started the journey to increase technical education by investing $7 million to re-open the technical education centre in Yekepa, Nimba county. The hard work and strategic planning of so many was realised at the launch.       Dawie Loots, manager and trainer at the VTC shared an overview of the program that clearly demonstrated his passion for his work and apprentices. “What an incredible journey!” he exclaimed. The heart of his speech spoke to the courage shown by ArcelorMittal Liberia to answer the call of the Liberian people as well as Liberians’ perseverance, hope and ability to unite for a greater good. Loots, his staff and the first class of VTC apprentices worked tirelessly to rehabilitate the buildings; “no contractors, no consultants. Just the VTC trainers & apprentices” he shared.       There are currently 47 apprentices at the vocational training centre studying various technical disciplines from diesel mechanic apprenticeships to electrician and mechanical fitting training. In 2021, powered by the official launch of the centre, the VTC hopes to train 100 apprentices. Entry into the vocational training centre is competitive as the program is free to successful candidates and houses and feeds them during the three-year duration of the apprenticeship.       Two apprentices spoke at the event Sam K. Dehmie (electrical apprentice) and Ernest Barlea (mechanical fitting apprentice). Both impressed vice president, Jewel Howard-Taylor as they described their experiences and their appreciation for the discipline, technical knowledge and awareness of safety in every aspect of their training. The young men are natives of Nimba County; Dehmie is a graduate of the ArcelorMittal Liberia school system. His friend Barlea urged his fellow apprentices to “take full advantage and do [their] best”.       The keynote address was delivered by Her Excellency, Jewel Howard Taylor, vice president of the Republic of Liberia. She brought greetings on behalf of President George Weah and thanked ArcelorMittal Liberia for its dedication to the nation. She commended the company for creating opportunities for youth stressing that “we must be involved in making meaningful contributions to their posterity through the acquisition of relevant skills which will enable them access to jobs and business opportunities. This is especially necessary, given the large numbers of unemployed and underemployed youths across our nation.” She asked local government to “please let us take politics out of development” encouraging cooperation between the government and the company; a message that was reiterated throughout the program by several government officials. “I believe that when the story is told of the renaissance of our beautiful nation, your story will be one of its successes. Our government looks forward to working with you through challenges which may arise and celebrating with you in the good times,” she said before touring the VTC.       “The Legislature is committed to work along with ArcelorMittal,” said Nimba County District 3 representative, Hon. Joseph N. Somwarbi. He shared that he was hopeful for the company’s presence in the county believing that more contractors would evolve into full time employees. He also emphasised that “recruitment [should be] transparent & training be adequate.”       According to Gustavo Gomes, vice president of mining operations for ArcelorMittal, Liberia is the fifth largest mine operation of ArcelorMittal mines worldwide. The business unit could become second largest in ArcelorMittal if an ongoing feasibility study leads to major investment in the next few years. “These young Liberians represent the future workforce of the company and overall technical experts in the nation,” he said.       As ArcelorMittal Liberia strives to expand its operations, jobs and knowledge are expected to increase, led by brilliant young Liberians, a government excited to engage investors and ArcelorMittal Liberia; a company that believes in Liberia’s immense potential.

This joint pledge by ArcelorMittal Mining Canada and ArcelorMittal Mining R&D marks the first major financial contribution by the fund to an educational institution in Canada.

Safety is ArcelorMittal’s top priority. To engage effectively with employees on a topic that literally can be a matter of life or death, corporate health and safety and communications departments collaborated to commission a video that would give everyone pause to think about why safety is a priority as well as why they want to return home safely at the end of each shift.  The film, follows the true and tragic story of their colleague ‘Max’, as read out by unsuspecting employee volunteers from around the world who represented all levels of seniority within the company. When it first aired internally across the company to mark ArcelorMittal’s annual Health and Safety Day in April, the film resonated so well with employees that they wanted to share it with their family and friends. So the company, for the first time ever, published its Health and Safety Day film externally. Since May 2018, We choose the safest way has had almost 25,000 YouTube views and is well on the way to becoming the company’s most-watched video production ever.  Robin Paulmier, Head of Corporate Health and Safety says, “The company has been organising an annual group-wide health and safety day for over a decade and although it has achieved a significant improvement in health and safety performance over that time, achieving our ultimate aim of being an injury-free workplace has proved elusive. To drive further progress toward this goal, the health and safety committee and I felt a fresh, personal and highly emotional message might encourage us all to stop and think about workplace safety in a way no other film has. We choose the safest way has achieved that goal beyond all expectation, touching not only our colleagues, but also a panel of esteemed film industry professionals. Congratulations and sincere thanks to everyone involved in this project, particularly our employee volunteers who connected with Max’s story with genuine emotion and gave the film its impact.”  Nicola Davidson, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Corporate Responsibility says, “We are all delighted with the award that recognises a film about a topic, health and safety, that is ArcelorMittal’s number one priority but that is creatively difficult to address. At the end of the day this film was made to help save lives and reduce accidents so it must tackle the issue head on, and make people stop and think about what more they can personally do to ensure we work in a truly safe environment at all times. Ensuring a safe working environment for all our employees every day takes constant attention and awareness and effective communication has a critical role to play. This is a film’s uniquely human approach resonated deeply with all parts of the company. Congratulations to everyone who was involved, including the volunteers, our own employees, who participated and made the film possible.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2018-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","title":"“We choose the safest way” is golden at Cannes","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal is delighted to announce that its ground-breaking health and safety film, We choose the safest way has won a gold medal at The Cannes Corporate Media & TV Awards in Cannes, France.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2018-oct-4-we-choose-the-safest-way-is-golden-at-cannes\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Collectively, these organisations employ 15 million people, 7 million of whom are women. This year’s GEI indexed companies account for US $9 trillion worth of traded stock market shares.  Bloomberg’s standardised gender reporting framework offers ArcelorMittal the opportunity to disclose information on how it promotes gender equality and to learn good practice from others on the index.  The GEI also provides the company with a framework for improving its understanding of how it promotes gender sensitivity in the way it does business, helping it to close the ‘gender gap’ in the broadest sense.  Bart Wille, executive vice president, head of human resources at ArcelorMittal said:  “ArcelorMittal has chosen to participate in the Gender-Equality Index because it gives us an opportunity to gain further insights to enhance an area we know we can strengthen further, that is achieving better female representation at all levels of the organisation. We want to publicly demonstrate our commitment to recruit, retain and develop the best talent – male or female – by building an inclusive culture and a strong and diverse talent pipeline. As a leading global industrial company, we operate in an extremely competitive landscape and we do not want to miss the opportunity to tap into half of the available global talent pool, or to cultivate the first-class ideas mixed gender teams can create.”  The GEI highlighted several elements of ArcelorMittal’s approach to gender equality as best in class results. These are:    * A third of the members of the company’s board of directors is female   * ArcelorMittal subsidiaries around the world promote Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) programmes which encourage young girls to pursue studies and a career in this area   * Female staff engage in the company’s Women in Leadership programme and   * The company is an active member of gender equality organisations, e.g. Women in Mining.    The GEI is also an important resource for investors who wish to benchmark ArcelorMittal’s performance on gender diversity against that of its peers. Such data increasingly influences investment decisions, so transparency on this and other key environmental, social and governance performance metrics is the cornerstone for good investor relations.   “We applaud ArcelorMittal and the 229 firms tracked by the index for their action to measure gender equality through the Bloomberg GEI framework,” said Peter T. Grauer, Chairman of Bloomberg and Founding Chairman of the U.S. 30% club. ArcelorMittal’s GEI inclusion is a strong indicator to investors and industry peers alike that it is leading by example to advance ongoing efforts for a truly inclusive workforce.”  The Bloomberg gender reporting framework is voluntary reference index and has no associated costs. All public companies can submit data to Bloomberg. Those with a security listed on a U.S. exchange and a market capitalisation of US 1 billion or greater are eligible for index inclusion.

{"id":6423,"text":"Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, ArcelorMittal Chairman and CEO, said:  “2018 was a year of positive momentum for ArcelorMittal characterized by important strategic and financial progress. Operating in a healthy market environment, the Company enjoyed a strong financial performance, delivering substantial profitability improvement. Having considerably strengthened our balance sheet in recent years, we also regained our investment grade credit rating.  With an established leadership position in many regions, ArcelorMittal targets specific growth opportunities to complement our existing global presence. The acquisitions of Votorantim and Ilva, both completed in 2018, provide us with enhanced leadership positions in key markets. Meanwhile our bid for Essar can provide us with a quality, scalable presence in the rapidly expanding India steel market.  Delivery against our Action 2020 targets is an important focus for the Group in 2019. We did not perform at an optimum level operationally in 2018 and will seek to minimize operational disruption this year to ensure we meet our volume targets.  Although the issue of global overcapacity persists and there are well publicised macro-economic risks, we expect further, moderate global steel demand growth this year. Having considerably strengthened the Company in recent years, we are in a strong position to generate healthy levels of free cash and prosper through the cycle.”  Fourth quarter 2018 earnings analyst conference call  ArcelorMittal management (including CEO and CFO) will host a conference call for members of the investment community to discuss the fourth quarter period ended December 31, 2018 on: Thursday February 7, 2019 at 9.30am US Eastern time; 2.30pm London time and 3.30pm CET.  ### The dial in numbers are:  Location | Toll free dial in numbers | Local dial in numbers |  Participant   ---|---|---|---   UK local: | 0800 0515 931 | +44(0)2033645807 | 12722991#   US local: | 1 86 6719 2729 | +12406450345 | 12722991#   US (New York): | 1 86 6719 2729 | +16466637901 | 12722991#   France: | 0800 914780 | +33170712916 | 12722991#   Germany: | 0800 965 6288 | +4969271340801 | 12722991#   Spain: | 90 099 4930 | +34911143436 | 12722991#   Luxembourg: | 800 26908 | +35227860507 | 12722991#      A replay of the conference call will be available for one week by dialing: +49 (0) 1805 2047 088; Access code 2523083#","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal reports fourth quarter 2018 and full year 2018 results","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (referred to as “ArcelorMittal” or the “Company”) (MT (New York, Amsterdam, Paris, Luxembourg), MTS (Madrid)), the world’s leading integrated steel and mining company, today announced results[1] for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-reports-fourth-quarter-2018-and-full-year-2018\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6424,"text":"Having informed and discussed the situation with the local authorities, it was agreed that the 200 person community situated downstream to the dam should be evacuated as a precautionary measure.  The action follows an updated site-based assessment commissioned by ArcelorMittal Mining of the tailings dam by the Independent Tailings Review Panel following the recent incidents in the Brazilian mining sector. The assessment included stress tests on the Serra Azul pond applying early observations available from the Feijao dam. Based on the range of factor of safety evaluation, a decision was taken to evacuate all residents while further testing is undertaken and any mitigation measures can be implemented. The historic failure-flow-path when the dam was active was approximately four to five kilometres.  This is a purely precautionary measure and the community is situated 5km from the dam. The company concluded that absolutely no risk can be taken and, despite the obvious disruption to the community, this is the right decision.  The community have been moved into temporary accommodation. They will remain there while further tests are ongoing and until the security of the tailings pond can be 100% guaranteed.  Benjamin Baptista, ArcelorMittal Brazil CEO said, “We apologise to the local community for the disruption; however we know this is the right and indeed only decision that we could take and the authorities agreed. We will endeavour to get people back in their homes as soon as possible although at this point it is not possible to say when that will be. Experts continue to analyse the tailings pond and in the event that measures have to be implemented to further secure the pond that will be carried out as swiftly as possible. We thank the employees and community for their understanding during this difficult time.”  Sebastiao Costa Filho, CEO Mining Brazil said: “Our absolute priority is to ensure our people and our communities are safe. We will be maintaining close communication with those affected to keep them updated about the situation. As soon as we have further information we will make further announcements. I would also like to thank everyone affected – this is clearly a difficult situation and one we hope will be resolved as swiftly as possible.”  The Serra Azul mine is located in Itatiaiuçu, Minas Gerais State, in Brazil. It produces 1.2 million tonnes of concentrate and lump ore. The tailings dam, which is an upstream dam, has been idled since October 2012. It is the only such “upstream” dam in the company’s mining portfolio.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal evacuates community situated around its dormant Serra Azul tailing dam as precautionary measure","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announces that after very careful consideration it has taken the decision to put in practice the evacuation plan related to its dormant Serra Azul tailing dam, in Brazil.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-feb-8-arcelormittal-evacuates-community\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6430,"text":"We employ a strong governance model based on the MAC (Mining Association of Canada) guidelines for TSFs. Our global tailings stewardship programme employs three types of audit – in-house at site level, in-house at corporate level, and a third, entirely independent audit – and these are aimed at providing a ‘triple check’ of our TSFs against our corporate standard and international guidelines (including ANCOLD, MAC and CDA).  Following the Feijão accident, our particular focus was on Serra Azul, where our TSF is the only one in our portfolio that uses an upstream ‘wet’ dam construction. The TSF had been dormant since 2012 and possesses significantly lower moisture content than that reported for the Feijão TSF. Applying early concerns from the Feijão TSF failure, we stress-tested the Serra Azul dam model safety factors. Consequently, we decided to err on the side of caution and evacuate the local community downstream of the dam, enabling us to carry out further testing and safely implement any mitigation measures.  This is a disruption to the community, for which we are sorry, but we are convinced that it has been the right thing to do and we are working hard to ensure we look after the needs of those affected. After moving households located within approximately 5km from the dam into hotels, we set up an emergency response plan to look after their livestock and business assets, and to ensure the children have continued access to education. By March 2019, a phased plan to rehouse the families has begun, following international best practice.  We are currently reviewing our approach to decommissioning the Serra Azul TSF to maximise safety.  Our tailings transition plan   Across all our TSFs, we have developed an approach to optimise their safety.    1. No new wet tailings dams.   2. Accelerate the use of non-wet disposal such as thickened paste tailings or dry stack tailings options where possible. We already employ this approach in Mexico and Brazil iron ore mines.   3. Optimise the use of radar and satellite monitoring to heighten the sensitivity of remote monitoring and enable transparent access to this data.    These three principles are underpinned by our strong TSF governance system.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Ensuring the safety of our tailings storage facilities","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"The tragedy of the Vale Feijão dam failure prompted all mining companies to examine the monitoring systems at their tailings storage facilities (TSFs).

{"id":6433,"text":"This year, the Group intends to launch a new project in the ArcelorMittal plant in Hamburg to use hydrogen on an industrial scale for the direct reduction of iron ore in the steel production process for the first time. A pilot plant is to be built in the coming years.  Already today, the Hamburg plant has one of the most efficient production processes of the ArcelorMittal Group due to the use of natural gas in a direct reduction plant (DRI). The aim of the new hydrogen-based process is to be able to produce steel with the lowest CO2 emissions. The project costs amount to around 65 million euros. In addition, a cooperation agreement with the University of Freiberg is planned to test the procedure in the coming years at the Hamburg plant premises.   \"Our Hamburg site offers optimum conditions for this innovative project: an electric arc furnace with DRI system and iron ore pellets stockyard as well as decades of know-how in this area. The use of hydrogen as a reducing agent shall now be tested in a new shaft furnace,\" comments Frank Schulz, CEO of ArcelorMittal Germany.  The hydrogen-based reduction of iron ore will initially take place on a demonstration scale with an annual production of 100,000 tonnes.  In the process, the separation of H2 with a purity of more than 95 percent from the top gas of the existing plant should be achieved by so-called pressure swing adsorption. The process is first tested with grey hydrogen (generated at gas separation) to allow for economical operation. In the future, the plant should also be able to run on green hydrogen (generated from renewable sources) when it is available in sufficient quantities.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"World first for steel: ArcelorMittal investigates the industrial use of pure hydrogen","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Cologne, March 28, 2019 - To permanently reduce CO2 emissions, ArcelorMittal has developed a low-emissions technology strategy, which targets not only the use of alternative feedstocks and the conversion of CO2 emissions, but also the direct avoidance of carbon (Carbon Direct Avoidance, or CDA).","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-mar-28-world-first-for-steel\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6439,"text":"The review underpins the Company’s commitment to transparent reporting. It has been produced in-line with the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework and demonstrates the Company’s approach to ensuring it brings long-term, sustainable value to its broad stakeholder base. It outlines the Company’s progress against its four strategic priorities, namely: improving its safety performance; achieving its financial targets; delivering on its Action 2020 strategic plan; and integrating sustainability into the business.  The review, which can be accessed online at http:\/\/annualreview2018.arcelormittal.com includes videos of several members of ArcelorMittal’s senior management team, including: Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO; Aditya Mittal, President and CFO, ArcelorMittal and CEO, ArcelorMittal Europe; Brian Aranha, executive vice president; and David Clarke, vice president. Topics covered include:    * ArcelorMittal’s health and safety performance in 2018: progress made against its stated ambition of zero injuries and fatalities and the approach being undertaken to drive further improvement and instill a safety-first culture throughout the organisation;   * ArcelorMittal’s financial and operational performance in 2018: progress made in the third year of the Company’s five-year strategic plan, Action 2020; how the Company further strengthened its balance sheet; and how it is strengthening its operating platform through selectively investing in high-return opportunities;   * The steps the Company is taking to integrate sustainable development into its business, with a focus on: improving safety performance; addressing the carbon challenge; building a high-performing organisation; innovating to support customers and society; providing customer reassurance through global standards and certification; and anticipating and responding to social and environmental trends.    Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal said:  “As the world’s leading steel and mining company, our world-class steel solutions have an important role to play in society. Our goal is to ensure that steel remains the world’s material of choice, and ArcelorMittal the world’s preferred steel supplier. We aim to do this in a manner that is as efficient and effective as possible so we can return value to our broad stakeholder base.  “Against a backdrop of positive market conditions, ArcelorMittal delivered its best financial performance for several years, generating Ebitda of $10.3 billion and net income of $5.1 billion. We also now have industry-leading balance sheet strength and are investing in opportunities to create value so that we build an even stronger, more resilient group. Two good examples of this last year were our acquisitions of Ilva in Italy and Votorantim in Brazil. We also progressed our five-year strategic plan, Action 2020, and have now delivered $1.6 billion from our $3 billion Ebitda target. We therefore have a lot to be pleased about with our performance in 2018.  “Our focus, however, is to ensure that ArcelorMittal is not just successful today, but that our success endures into the future. To do this we must ensure that sustainable development is embedded throughout our business. Addressing climate change and supporting the transition to a low-carbon, circular economy is an important part of this. We are developing a low-emissions technology strategy but need to see public policy evolve to support our efforts.  “Elsewhere, the launch of Steligence® last year is a good example of how we are innovating to meet customers environmental and sustainability goals. It provides our construction sector customers with sustainable building solutions now, while promoting the reuse of steel components at the end of a building’s life. And last year, we also continued to advance our efforts to develop an industry-wide supply-chain assurance scheme, ResponsibleSteel™, which will provide customers with the reassurance they need.  “To conclude, 2018 was a positive year for ArcelorMittal. Our strategic priorities are well established and our focus for the year ahead and beyond is clear. ArcelorMittal is a more resilient, more focused, more capable business than it ever has been.”  Key highlights of ArcelorMittal’s sustainable development approach and progress discussed in the review include:    * Further progress in safety performance, with a record low lost-time injury frequency rate of 0.69x;   * The steps the Company is taking to address the carbon challenge, how it is developing a broad range of technologies to enable it to transition to low-emissions steelmaking and support the objectives of the 2015 Paris agreement. The Company is developing a corporate action plan for carbon reduction which will support a new group-wide 2030 target, to be announced next year. It also plans to publish a detailed Climate Action report in the coming weeks.   * Case studies on:   * A mapping of the UN sustainable development goals against those the Company addresses through its approach to integrating sustainable development into the business;   * A summary of value creation for stakeholders in 2018, in the Company’s value creation model. Examples include   * $4.8 billion total tax contribution;   * $652 million allocated to environmental and energy capital projects;   * A 7% reduction in dust emissions per tonne of steel over three years and a corresponding reduction in NOx of 6%;   * 70 new patents filed and 26 new products launched aimed at creating sustainable development value with a further 38 R&D projects for sustainable development in the pipeline;   * 10 million tonnes of CO2 avoided due to the re-use of blast furnace slag in the cement industry;   * Inclusion in the Bloomberg gender diversity index.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes 2018 integrated annual review","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’), the world’s leading steel and mining company, has today published its 2018 integrated annual review.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-apr-29-arcelormittal-publishes-2018-integrated-annual-review\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["unsure"]}
{"id":6440,"text":"ArcelorMittal today announces its intention to temporarily idle production at its steelmaking facilities in Kraków, Poland and reduce production in Asturias, Spain. In addition, the planned increase of shipments at ArcelorMittal Italia to a six million tonne annual run-rate will be slowed down following a decision to optimise cost and quality over volume in this environment.   Together, these actions will result in a temporary annualised production reduction of around three million tonnes.  Commenting, Geert van Poelvoorde, CEO, ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, said:  “The difficult decision to temporarily reduce our European primary flat steel production has not been taken lightly. We understand the impact this has on employees and the local communities and will be working to ensure social measures are in place to support them during this period.  “These actions reflect the weak demand environment in Europe today, a situation further compounded by increased imports despite the safeguard measures introduced by the European Commission. High energy costs and increasing carbon costs are adding to the tough environment.  “We are engaging with stakeholders to request that the safeguards are strengthened to prevent a further increase in imports as a result of continued global overcapacity and a weakening economy in neighbouring countries including Turkey. We will also continue to make our case for a green border adjustment to be introduced to ensure that imports into Europe face the same carbon costs as producers in Europe. The steel industry in Europe can have a strong future but there must be a level playing field to ensure that an unfair advantage is not given to competitors outside the region.”  In Kraków, the primary production (blast furnace and steel plant) will be temporarily idled. The Polish steel market has been particularly hard hit, due to a near fourfold year-on-year increase in Russian steel imports in 2018, and among the highest electricity prices in Europe.  In Asturias, primary production will be reduced. Electricity costs are also very high in Spain, and the southern European market has been hit by an unprecedented rise in imports from outside the EU.  Despite the introduction of the permanent EU safeguard tariffs in February 2019 there has been a continued and consistent rise in flat steel imports into Europe. Flat steel imports into Europe are currently at record highs, with imports of hot rolled coil up 37 per cent this year from 2017, on an annualised basis. In addition, the price of carbon has risen by approximately 230 per cent since the start of 2018, placing further competitive pressure on European steelmakers. In the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), only steel produced in Europe is subject to a carbon levy. ArcelorMittal has previously called for the introduction of a green border adjustment whereby steel imported into Europe has the same standards applied on CO2 as European produced steel under the ETS.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal to temporarily reduce annualised European primary steelmaking production by three million tonnes","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Regrettable decision necessary due to combination of weakening demand, rising imports coupled with insufficient EU trade protection, high energy costs and rising carbon costs","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-to-temporarily-reduce-annualised-european\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6444,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) has today published its first Climate Action report in which it announces its ambition to significantly reduce CO2 emissions globally and be carbon neutral in Europe by 2050. To achieve this goal the Company is building a strategic roadmap linked to the evolution of public policy and developments in low-emissions steelmaking technologies. A target to 2030 will be launched in 2020, replacing the Company’s current target of an 8% carbon footprint reduction by 2020, against a 2007 baseline.  The report explains in greater detail the future challenges and opportunities for the steel industry, the plausible technology pathways the Company is exploring as well as its views on the policy environment required for the steel industry to succeed in meeting the targets of the Paris Agreement.  Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “We believe it can be possible for the steel industry to deliver carbon emissions reductions targets in line with the Paris agreement. We are committed to this objective and are actively piloting several low-carbon steelmaking technologies. Central to achieving this aspiration will be supportive policy to ensure a global level playing field, access to sufficient clean energy at competitive prices and access to finance. The energy industry has made great strides in creating a pathway to lower emissions through supportive policy and we are confident the same can be true for steel.  “Limiting the temperature increase to two degrees or less is no easy challenge. Real and genuine understanding of the complexities and an approach of collaboration and flexibility will be critical if we are to succeed. Specifically, we will need a more supportive policy environment that considers the global nature of steel, the cost implications of significantly changing the way steel is made and the clean energy supply needed to do so. If we can work together to solve the problem, I’m convinced the steel industry will be able to make a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions globally.”   As one of the world’s most prolific materials, with 1.7 billion tonnes of steel produced in 2018, the steel industry today accounts for approximately 7% per cent of global emissions. And with demand for steel and materials set to further increase - forecasts show demand rising to 2.6 billion tonnes in 2050 - it is vital the industry finds ways to significantly reduce its carbon emissions to successfully meet the ambitions of the Paris agreement and help limit the global average temperature rise to less than two degrees.  At present carbon is used as a reductant in the blast furnace to separate oxygen from iron-ore as a critical part of the steel-making process. Significantly reducing the emissions footprint of steel will, in all likelihood, require a fundamental change in the science of steelmaking  As the world’s leading steel company, ArcelorMittal recognises it has a leading role to play in developing breakthrough technologies that will support and enable a global transition to a low-carbon economy. The Company has identified three distinct pathways that have the potential to deliver a significant reduction in carbon emissions. These are:    * Clean power steelmaking, using clean power as the energy source for hydrogen-based steelmaking, and longer-term for direct electrolysis steelmaking   * Circular carbon steelmaking, which uses circular carbon energy sources, such as waste biomass, to displace fossil fuels in steelmaking, thereby enabled low-emissions steelmaking   * Fossil fuel carbon capture and storage, where the current method of steel production is maintained but the carbon is then captured and stored or re-used rather than emitted into the atmosphere.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes first Climate Action Report","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Report states ArcelorMittal’s ambition to significantly reduce global CO2 emissions and be carbon neutral in its European operations by 2050","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-publishes-first-climate-action-report\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6445,"text":"If ratified as currently drafted, the provision concerning the Taranto plant would impair any operator’s ability to operate the plant while implementing the environmental plan approved by the Italian Government in September 2017, including for ArcelorMittal. The Taranto plant has been under seizure since 2012 and cannot be operated without legal protection until the environmental plan is implemented.  The 2017 environmental plan is designed to address the Taranto plant’s long-standing issues and transform it into a state-of-the-art European steel facility by applying best available techniques, with an overall environmental investment by AMI of over €1.15 billion. The implementation of the agreed plan is proceeding according to schedule.  However, the Crescita law decree removes the legal safeguards existing when ArcelorMittal agreed to invest in the Taranto plant. These safeguards are necessary until the company has completed the environmental plan to avoid incurring liability for issues that it did not create.  The law decree is to be ratified into law by 29th June. AMI remains hopeful that, as part of the amendment process, legal certainty will be restored in the interest of the Italian economy and of the stakeholders of ArcelorMittal Italia, enabling AMI to continue operate of the plant while completing the environmental requalification plan.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Statement regarding the Italian Crescita law decree and its potential implications for ArcelorMittal Italia","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal confirms that its Italian subsidiary (ArcelorMittal Italia “AMI”) has highlighted to the Italian government its concerns about the current text of the Crescita law decree.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/statement-regarding-the-italian-crescita-law-decree\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6447,"text":"ResponsibleSteel™ is the steel industry’s first, multi-stakeholder certification initiative that aims to set a single, global standard for the entire ‘mine-to-metal’ steel value chain. The multi-stakeholder initiative, of which ArcelorMittal was a founding member and has played a leading role in developing, was first established in 2015. Efforts to accelerate the creation of the standard, including extensive public consultation periods, have increased over the past 12 months, leading to yesterday’s approval of draft version four. The standard will enable steel producers to prove their production processes and products meet rigorously defined standards across a broad range of social, environmental and ethical criteria. It will also serve to improve responsible sourcing of raw materials used in steelmaking and reduce supply-chain risk.  Commenting at the event, Alan Knight, head of sustainable development at ArcelorMittal and co-chair of ResponsibleSteel™ said:  “I am encouraged both by the progress we have made in developing the ResponsibleSteel™ standard and the broad-based interest in the scheme. For a scheme like this to truly gain market acceptance we need involvement, collaboration and input from multiple stakeholder groups. Steel industry participants clearly have an important role to play in its development, but an accreditation scheme created solely by the steel industry and for the steel industry would lack credibility. The multi-stakeholder aspect is critical, so the support and membership sign up we have received from mining majors, financial institutions, steel consuming customers and NGOs brings that credibility. It has also been integral in ensuring the development of the standard is sufficiently stringent – we received over 600 responses to the public consultation carried out on version three of the standard. With this input carried into version four, I am confident the scheme will be market ready later this year and will achieve its objective of providing the reassurance steel customers and industry stakeholders need on industry sustainability standards.”  ResponsibleSteel™ currently has 19 full members and 18 associate members including steel producers (Aperam, ArcelorMittal, BlueScope Steel, VAMA and voestalpine), financial institutions (HSBC), automotive majors (BMW and Daimler), NGOs (International Union for Conservation of Nature, Fauna and Flora International, CDP and others) and associated industry bodies (IndustriALL, International Tin Association and International Zinc Association).  ArcelorMittal has undertaken readiness assessment against version three of the standard across nearly all its European flat products production sites, and at sites in the US and Brazil, with positive results. It is currently working on a site assessment and verification plan, starting in Europe, in anticipation of the market launch of the standard later this year.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Inaugural steel industry certification standard, ResponsibleSteel™, on track for market launch before year-end","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Following a two-day members’ meeting last week, hosted by ArcelorMittal at the ArcelorMittal Orbit at the Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, version four of the new draft ResponsibleSteel™ certification standard has been reviewed by members with formal market launch of the standard now expected towards the end of the year.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/phase-two-2019-june-24-inaugural-steel-industry-certification-standard\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements of Directive 2014\/65\/EU on financial instruments, as amended (“MiFID II”) and local implementing measures and each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate (the “Target Market Assessment”). Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ Target Market Assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.  Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Notes may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Notes offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Notes is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the offering.

{"id":6455,"text":"In a report released today, ArcelorMittal ranks first in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) report ‘Melting Point’, in the categories of low carbon innovations, transition opportunities, data transparency, renewable energy use and board and executive climate management.  The world’s leading steel and mining company ranked second place overall in the latest report from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which ranked 20 of the largest and highest-impact publicly listed steel companies worldwide. ArcelorMittal ranked fifth in CDP’s 2016 report.  The new report is based on detailed analysis across a range of carbon and transitional indicators which could have a significant impact on company performance. The league table is designed to serve as a proxy for business readiness in an industry which will face increasing challenges as governments increase efforts to implement the Paris Agreement.  Key highlights include:    * Transition opportunities – ArcelorMittal is ranked first for investing in a suite of radical and transformative technologies including Carbon2value, SIDERWIN, IGAR and Torero with significant decarbonisation potential.   * Data transparency – ArcelorMittal is ranked first for having the most comprehensive emissions and energy disclosures of its peer group, reporting emissions according to Worldsteel’s guidelines   * Low carbon innovations – ArcelorMittal is ranked first for pioneering a number of breakthrough technologies such as the SIDERWIN project to produce iron ore via electrolysis. The report also highlights our $65 million investment on an industrial scale DRI hydrogen-based plant in Hamburg.   * Renewable energy use – ArcelorMittal is ranked first with a number of renewable assets including 75MWe solar capacity, for multiple PPAs to acquire solar and wind power and for actively exploring the potential for further PPAs to supply its steel plants.   * Board and executive climate management – ArcelorMittal ranked first and recognised for having a sustainability committee at a board level overseeing the company’s sustainability issues and low-carbon transition strategies.   * Climate governance and strategy – ArcelorMittal is ranked second and is recognised for our ambition to be carbon neutral in its Europe operations by 2050 and for officially supporting the TCFD and other climate initiatives in the industry.    Alan Knight, Corporate Responsibility General Manager, at ArcelorMittal, says: “While steel has a lower carbon intensity that many other materials, the large volumes produced globally mean that the industry emits more than three gigatons of CO2 annually. With the demand for steel ever increasing, we know we have a role to play and a clear responsibility to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of steel.”  Knight says: “We’re very pleased that the CDP League Tables have recognised our efforts, with our ranking going up from fifth to second place. We are trialling new technologies in our steel plants, making significant investments in R&D and working with our customers to provide the most sustainable products.”  Knight continues “We know that there is more work to be done to achieve our ambition of being carbon neutral in Europe by 2050, and to significantly reduce our carbon emissions worldwide. Working with stakeholders to create supportive policies to ensure a global level playing field, access to renewable energy at affordable process and access to finance will be critical in achieving greater impact.”  ArcelorMittal recently published its first Climate Action report in which it announced its ambition to significantly reduce CO2emissions globally and be carbon neutral in Europe by 2050. To achieve this goal the company is building a strategic roadmap linked to the evolution of public policy and developments in low-emissions steelmaking technologies.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal ranked best steel company for low carbon innovations","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal has been ranked first in the world in five categories relating to steel companies’ readiness for a low carbon transition.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-jul-31-arcelormittal-ranked-best-steel-company-for-low-carbon-innovations\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6456,"text":"Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, ArcelorMittal Chairman and CEO, said:  \"After a strong 2018, market conditions in the first half of 2019 have been very tough, with the profitability of our steel segments suffering due to lower steel prices combined with higher raw material costs. This has been only partially offset by improved profitability from our mining segment, but I am pleased that we have generated healthy free cash flow demonstrating the improved robustness of the business thanks to our Action 2020 plan.  Global overcapacity remains a clear challenge. We have reduced capacity in Europe in response to the current weak demand environment, which has also impacted the turnaround of the ex-Ilva facilities in Italy. Further action needs to be taken to address the increasing level of imports entering the continent due to ineffective safeguard measures and we continue to engage with the European Commission to create a level playing field for the sector. A supportive regulatory and funding environment is also crucial to our ambition to significantly reduce our emissions as announced in our recent Climate Action report.  We are taking further actions to adapt and strengthen the Company, ensuring we make continued progress towards our net debt target and increase returns to shareholders. Despite the current challenges, the Company is well positioned to benefit from any improvement in market conditions and the current very low spread environment\".

{"id":6461,"text":"In total, the gender equality index now covers approximately 14,800 employees, representing 94% of its workforce in France. Of these 14,800 employees in France, 82% are above the 75 point threshold out of 100 with more than half (53%) in the higher category, scoring 88 points out of 100 or more.  The scores are as follows (out of 100 points, with a minimum of 75 points to be achieved):    * ArcelorMittal Distribution Solutions France (737 employees): 88 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Maizières Research (589 employees): 88 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Construction France (951 employees): 84 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Wire France (510 employees): 84 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal France Saint-Denis (308 employees): 83 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Gandrange (292 employees): 79 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Service Centres (693 employees): 61 out of 100    These 7 companies represent a total of 4,080 employees.  ArcelorMittal Service Centres is the only one to score slightly below the 75 point threshold. Despite a good performance on equal pay (36 points out of 40), the overall score is lower due a gap in individual increases. Corrective actions have already been implemented to help the company improve in this area.  In March 2019, ArcelorMittal published the gender equality index for its three largest companies in France, which together represent nearly 11,000 employees:    * ArcelorMittal France, formerly ArcelorMittal Atlantique et Lorraine* (6,900 employees): 89 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Méditerranée (2,600 employees): 83 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Industeel (1,100 employees): 73 out of 100**    ArcelorMittal's proactive policies in the field of professional equality have made it possible in particular to achieve a good overall level of equal pay, equal individual increases and individual increase rates upon return from maternity leave.  Eric Niedziela, Vice President of ArcelorMittal and CEO of ArcelorMittal France, says: “Being a woman in the steel industry should no longer be an exception. Whether they are maintenance technicians or quality managers, R&D researchers or production apprentices, women now occupy a variety of jobs at ArcelorMittal. We strongly support this equality of opportunity approach.”  ArcelorMittal aims to support equal opportunities and further expand its talent pool by recruiting and promoting women within its structures. A variety of initiatives are in place nationally and locally at the sites to promote the steel industry and change its image in order to encourage women to join the company: interventions in middle and high schools, site visits, relations with the grandes écoles, partnership with the \"Elles Bougent\" association, \"Femmes de steel\" operation on the Fos-sur-Mer site.  In terms of remuneration, during negotiations with the social partners, an analysis is systematically carried out on wages by gender and work regime, particularly full-time and part-time.

{"id":6463,"text":"Equinor is a partner in the Northern Lights project, together with partners Shell and Total, which includes transport, reception and permanent storage of CO2 in a reservoir in the northern part of the North Sea.  ArcelorMittal committed to the project with Equinor at a ceremony in Oslo, where the European Commission is hosting a High-Level Conference on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) together with the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. Today, memorandums of understanding have been signed between Equinor and ArcelorMittal, as well as Air Liquide, Ervia, Fortum Oyj, HeidelbergCement AG, Preem, and Stockholm Exergi.  As part of the project, ArcelorMittal – which has an ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050 within Europe - has committed to a number of joint activities including the development of logistics, exploring potential commercial models, and advocating on the topic of carbon capture and use (CCU) and CCS, as an important part of the successful decarbonisation of European industry. The company’s primary role will be the capture of CO2 gas from its blast furnaces.  At the end of 2019, the partnership plans to drill a wildcat well for CO2 storage in the Johanson formation covered by the Aurora licence (EL001) to study the reservoir’s suitability and capacity for CO2 storage.

{"id":6464,"text":"Both companies have now signed a Framework Collaboration Agreement (FCA) to cooperate on several projects, ranging from research and development to the implementation of new technologies. The FCA will be governed by a number of Project Development Agreements, incorporating the expertise of Midrex and ArcelorMittal. The first Project Development Agreement is to demonstrate in Hamburg the large-scale production and use of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) made with 100% hydrogen as the reductant.   In the coming years, the demonstration plant will produce about 100,000 tons of direct reduced iron per year - initially with grey hydrogen sourced from natural gas. Conversion to green hydrogen from renewable energy sources will take place once available in sufficient quantities and at an economical cost. Energy for hydrogen production could come from wind farms off the coast of Northern Germany. The plant will be the world’s first direct reduction plant on an industrial scale, powered by hydrogen.  \"We are working with a world class provider, Midrex Technologies, to learn how you can produce virgin iron for steelmaking at a large scale by only using hydrogen. This project combined with our ongoing projects on the use of non-fossil carbon and on carbon capture and use is key to become carbon neutral in Europe in 2050. Large scale demonstrations are critical to show our ambition. However it will depend on the political conditions, how fast transformation will take place\", comments Carl de Maré, Vice President at ArcelorMittal and responsible for technology strategy.       ArcelorMittal Hamburg already produces steel using DRI technology. During the process, iron oxide pellets are reduced to metallic iron, the raw material for high quality steel, by extracting oxygen using natural gas. \"Our site is the most energy-efficient production plant at ArcelorMittal\", says Dr Uwe Braun, CEO at ArcelorMittal Hamburg, adding that the existing Midrex plant in Hamburg is also the plant with the lowest CO2-emissions for high quality steel production in Europe. \"With the new, hydrogen-based DRI plant we are now planning, we will raise steel production to a completely new level, as part of our Europe-wide ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050\", Dr Braun concludes.  \"This commercial scale project will show the path for hydrogen based iron and steel making\", commented Stephen C.

{"id":6465,"text":"Installed by Eneco, this is their largest project to date. The project will help ArcelorMittal Belgium in becoming more sustainable as the power generated will be used internally by ArcelorMittal in Ghent. More than 5,000 employees are also given the opportunity to co-invest in the solar panels and benefit from the revenues.  Eneco -the largest solar energy producer in Belgium- has installed a 7.5 million euros solar roof at ArcelorMittal in Ghent. The park consists of 27,104 solar panels for which 157.2 tons of steel was used. The total weight of the installation amounts to 1.5 million kilos. This means that ArcelorMittal now owns the fourth largest solar park in Belgium and the largest solar roof in Belgium.  Reinforce sustainability strategy  The new solar panels will produce 10.000MWh annually, equal to the energy consumption of 2,900 households. The solar panels, together with the site’s (current) 10 wind turbines and the 2 additionally planned wind turbines, will soon provide approximately 50MW of renewable power to the Ghent site. The sustainable energy that is generated is used entirely internally to feed the production of ArcelorMittal in Ghent.  Today, ArcelorMittal Belgium is a world-leader in energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. With this investment, the company reinforces the implementation of its sustainability strategy. ArcelorMittal Belgium follows the climate agreement of Paris. The site’s emissions are already 25% lower than in 1990, which is 20% better than what the Paris climate agreement demands. By 2027, ArcelorMittal Belgium aims to produce 43% fewer emissions, with the ambition of being carbon neutral by 2050.*  “The renewable energy generated by these 27,104 solar panels supports us in achieving our ambition to be climate-neutral by 2050. We’re fully committed to this ambition and excited to launch Belgium’s largest solar roof. Alongside our soon to be installed additional wind- turbines, we’re again taking steps in the right direction. In addition, the new solar panels are also a good example of the importance of steel in our daily lives. The panels are fixed on a framework made of steel coated with Magnelis®. The Magnelis® steel, produced at our production site in Liège among others, is a strong illustration of sustainability. It guarantees the long-term viability of each solar park, regardless of the environment in which it is located. Steel clearly is a sustainable product for a more sustainable future.” Manfred Van Vlierberghe, CEO ArcelorMittal Belgium.  More than 5,000 employees have the chance to co-invest in solar panels  The 5,800 employees of ArcelorMittal Belgium who work at the sites in Ghent, Genk, Geel and Liège have the opportunity to invest in the solar panels and to benefit from the revenues. They are offered this opportunity by means of crowdlending, a loan whereby the collaborators lend money to Eneco for a period of six years. They receive a guaranteed gross return of 4 percent for their investment. Each employee can invest between 250 euros and 1000 euros to ArcelorMittal Belgium for the solar roof.  “If you, for example, lend 500 euros, you will earn an extra 20 euros a year. In six years’ time, the employee earns 120 euros. After the term, (s)he will recover the original investment of 500 euros as well. Through crowdlending, we want to actively involve the employees in this sustainable project. By doing so, we hope to raise their awareness about the importance of sustainable energy and reward them for their efforts. We are therefore delighted that a major industrial player such as ArcelorMittal Belgium is reflecting on its energy consumption and is actively contributing to making a greener future possible for future generations”. Iwein Goigne, CEO Eneco Solar Belgium.  For Eneco, this is the second project, after Volvo Car Gent, in which employees can participate by means of crowdlending.  Fast growing energy vision within Ghent industry  The initiative of ArcelorMittal Belgium and Eneco is in line with the Flemish Government’s Energy Vision for 2021 – 2030. This Energy Vision states that energy consumption must be significantly reduced and that the industry must be 10% more energy efficient by 2030.  “Large renewable energy projects such as those at ArcelorMittal Belgium are necessary in order to put in place a real energy transition. It makes a big difference to a company’s energy bill, but also to the achievement of the renewable energy targets in Flanders. Many companies in the Ghent port area realize that this change of our mindsets is crucial and we are therefore pleased to see that the concrete implementation of the Energy Vision is being taken seriously.” Lydia Peeters, Flemish Deputy Prime Minister and Flemish Minister of Finance, Budget, Energy & Culture.  “I am pleased that ArcelorMittal continues to focus on the reduction of CO2 reduction and energy efficiency. The investment in this new solar park is one of their projects to achieve the ultimate goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050. In this way, our industry is working towards a sustainable and climate-neutral society.” Koen van den Heuvel, Flemish Minister of the Environment, Nature and Agriculture  “The city of Ghent and the North Sea Port are committed to renewable energy, CO2 reduction and reuse. By installing solar panels and solar parks in the cross-border port area, like at ArcelorMittal in Ghent, the port companies are generating renewable energy which is injected into the electricity grid, accounting for the equivalent of more than 31,000 households. In this way, our port is increasingly becoming a sustainable Energy Port, and together with all port companies, we are building a climate-neutral city by 2050.” Mathias De Clercq, mayor of the city of Ghent  ArcelorMittal Belgium continues to work on similar projects at its sites in Liège, Genk and Geel.

{"id":6468,"text":"Announced at the World Steel Association’s annual dinner in Monterrey, Mexico, the nod distinguishes the company’s industry leadership on sustainability amid the growing pressure steel companies are facing to outline their approach to reducing carbon emissions.      The award was given in recognition of the company’s publication of the steel sector’s first Climate Action report in May 2019. The report set out the three pathways the company believes can lead to deep decarbonisation of steelmaking, the various low-emissions technologies the company is trialling and the public policy required to make low-emissions steel a reality. It also confirms ArcelorMittal’s commitments to the objectives of the Paris Agreement and outlines the company’s ambition to significantly reduce emissions across the group, including reaching carbon neutrality in Europe by 2050.      Accepting the Steelie, Brian Aranha, executive vice president, head of strategy, CTO, R&D, CCM, global automotive, communications and corporate responsibility said:      “I am delighted to be able to collect this award for the third year in a row, particularly as I am told that the jury voted unanimously that ArcelorMittal should win it. We are immensely proud of the forward-thinking resource our people have put together to build stakeholder understanding of what a transition to a low-carbon steel industry means in practice. Although the report does not have all the answers, it is prompting some very important conversations with our stakeholders across the steel industry and beyond. Having these conversations will be essential to develop the collaborative approach the world needs to take if we are to unlock the full potential of the steel industry’s efforts to decarbonise. This includes working with governments around the world to develop consistent and supportive policy frameworks to enable our industry to succeed in meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement.”      The Climate Action report is available to download here.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Worldsteel acknowledges ArcelorMittal’s excellence in sustainability","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"For the third consecutive year, ArcelorMittal has won the Steelie Award for excellence in sustainability.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-oct-16-worldsteel-acknowledges-arcelormittal-s-excellence-in-sustainability-1\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6469,"text":"Additionally, company representatives have co-authored a CTBUH research paper titled: Steel and Skyscrapers: A Productive History and a Sustainable Future; and during the event will contribute presentations on Steel and Skyscrapers: A Partnership Through Time and The Sustainability of Steel; as well as moderating a panel discussion about High-Rise Design Drivers: Now to 2069.  The CTBUH is the world’s leading resource for professionals focused on the inception, design, construction, and operation of tall buildings and future cities. As a member of this association, ArcelorMittal has a major role in influencing steel’s contribution to the urban environment and is at the forefront of discussions regarding design codes and standards for tall building construction.  ArcelorMittal, as the first producer of wide-flange rolled shapes such as “H” and “I” beams, has helped to make steel accessible, affordable and durable. Such advances in steelmaking technologies have made tall buildings’ structural skeletons more efficient and have simplified the fabrication and construction processes necessary to build iconic buildings around the world. In doing so, the company (and its legacy businesses) have established a longstanding relationship with the construction industry.  The fact that the built environment is responsible for 39% of global energy-related CO2 emissions and more than 35% of global final energy use, it is not lost on us. ArcelorMittal’s sustainable development outcomes are influenced by the way we make steel and use resources, as well as the way our products are used.  So, in addition to our commitment to lowering our carbon footprint by 2050, ArcelorMittal works with CTBUH to measure the sustainability impact of steel and to equip tall building designers with research on materials, design methodologies and construction typologies that can lower the environmental impact of building projects. Recent studies include: Whole Life Cycle Assessment of the Sustainable Aspects of Structural Systems in Tall Buildings; Composite Megacolumns design methodology; and research focused on creating industry-accepted criteria for measuring tall building floor area. In-depth exploration of these studies, and a case study demonstrating how ArcelorMittal’s steelmaking advancements have directly influenced sustainable outcomes, are summarised in the previously mentioned CTBUH research paper and will also be addressed in our World Congress presentations.  The promotion and dissemination of these studies – in parallel with continuous improvements in our production practices – demonstrate ArcelorMittal’s commitment to supporting the design and construction industry as it strives to address the unintended consequences of using fossil fuels and to achieve sustainable development now and in the future.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal sponsors CTBUH's tenth World Congress","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal is proud to sponsor Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) as it marks its 50th anniversary at the 10th World Congress, “50 Forward | 50 Back”.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-oct-29-arcelormittal-sponsors-ctbuh-s-tenth-world-congress\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Effective on 3 November 2019, the Italian Parliament has removed the legal protection necessary for the Company to implement its environmental plan without the risk of criminal liability, thus justifying the withdrawal notice.  In addition, the decisions issued by the criminal court of Taranto bind the Ilva extraordinary Commissioners to complete certain prescriptions by 13 December 2019 – a term the Commissioners themselves deemed impossible to meet – failing which blast furnace number 2 will be shut down. Such prescriptions should also reasonably and prudentially be applied to the other two blast furnaces at the Taranto plant. The shutdown would make it impossible for the Company to implement its industrial plan, operate the Taranto plant and, generally, perform the Agreement.  Other serious occurrences, independent of the Company’s will, have also led to a situation of legal and operational uncertainty that has further significantly impaired the ability to carry out the necessary operations at Ilva and operate the Taranto plant.   All the mentioned circumstances also entitle the Company to terminate the Agreement under the applicable provisions and principles of the Italian Civil Code.

{"id":6482,"text":"“Europe’s commitment to reduce its carbon emissions to be net-zero should be applauded and we commend the leadership of Mrs von der Leyen and her team. However, the Green Deal will only work if there is full-scale transformation and support for industries.”  “The climate challenge is unprecedented, and bold action is therefore needed. Achieving our ambition of being carbon neutral by 2050 is a major challenge, but with the right political framework - allowing European steelmakers to remain competitive while the steel industry moves to carbon-neutral steelmaking - we’re convinced it’s achievable. The proposal for a carbon border adjustment, which effectively puts a carbon price on imports, recognizes that every country needs to play its part in reducing global CO2 emissions. By preventing steel production moving to countries where carbon emissions legislation is less strict, and where carbon emissions are therefore higher, means we put a stop to carbon leakage. This is exactly the type of action that is needed.”  While support for a carbon border adjustment has been growing in recent months, ArcelorMittal was one of the first companies to support a proposed carbon border adjustment and backs the European Commission’s proposals for a €35 billion ‘just transition’ fund, to invest in research, innovation and green technology.

{"id":6484,"text":"ArcelorMittal holds 60 per cent of AM\/NS India, with Nippon Steel holding the balance.  Aditya Mittal, President and CFO of ArcelorMittal, has been appointed Chairman of AM\/NS India, and Dilip Oommen has been appointed AM\/NS India’s CEO.  Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal, said:  “The acquisition of Essar Steel is an important strategic step for ArcelorMittal. India has long been identified as an attractive market for our company and we have been looking at suitable opportunities to build a meaningful production presence in the country for over a decade. Both India and Essar’s appeal are enduring. Essar has sizeable, profitable, well-located operations and the long-term growth potential for the Indian economy and therefore Indian steel demand are well known. The transaction also demonstrates how India benefits from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, a genuinely progressive reform whose positive impact will be felt widely across the Indian economy.  “We are also delighted to be embarking on this together with Nippon Steel, with whom we have a trusted, long-term relationship. Our combined strengths and technology will bring many new opportunities which will allow us to make a positive contribution to India’s target to grow steelmaking capacity to 300 million tonnes per annum by 2030, and for its manufacturing sector more broadly.”  Eiji Hashimoto, Representative Director and President of Nippon Steel, said:  “AM\/NS India manufactures flat steel, steel plates and steel pipes mainly at its integrated steel mill with nominal crude steel production capacity of 9.6 million tonnes per year in India, one of the most promising steel markets in the world. The company also has a wide-ranging domestic sales network and manufacturing plants in east India producing pellets, a raw material of steel.  “Nippon Steel and ArcelorMittal will bring out AM\/NS India’s potential by providing it with their respective business experience and world-leading advanced technologies, so as to promptly implement the resolution plan and realise its further business expansion. I am confident that AM\/NS India will play a significant role in the development of India’s steel industry, as one of its participants.  “For years Nippon Steel has been making direct investments in many countries, including Brazil, the United States, China and ASEAN countries, in areas where we can take advantage of our advanced technology contributing steadily to the industrial development and the enhancement of the self-sufficiency in each host country. We will strive to establish a prominent presence in India, conforming with its policy to increase domestically-produced steel products.”  Aditya Mittal, President and CFO of ArcelorMittal, added:  “India is a large and strategic market and we are delighted to be here. Our aim is to create sustainable and long-term value by becoming a leading steel manufacturer in the country. Essar Steel has quality facilities which provide us with immediate and substantial production capacity, and we also gain an excellent platform for further growth, across both volume and product quality. This acquisition gives us the opportunity to contribute to India’s expansion in infrastructure and urbanization in the coming decades. To do this, we have in place a targeted capital expenditure plan designed to build on our combined management strength, operational expertise, commitment to safe, sustainable steelmaking and industry-leading research and development. Through our proven partnership with Nippon Steel, we are confident that AM\/NS India will create significant value – for shareholders, our business partners, employees and communities in India.”  AM\/NS India is an integrated flat steel producer, and the largest steel company in western India. Its current level of annualised crude steel production is c. 7.5 million tonnes. It also has iron ore pellet facilities in the east of India, with current annual capacity of 14 million tonnes per annum. AM\/NS India’s plans include:    * An intention to increase finished steel shipments to 8.5 million tonnes over the medium-term. This will be achieved by initially completing ongoing capital expenditure projects and infusing expertise and best practice to deliver efficiency gains, and then through the commissioning of additional assets, while simultaneously improving product quality and grades to realise better margins;   * A long-term aspiration to increase finished steel shipments to between 12 and 15 million tonnes through the addition of new iron and steelmaking assets, in order that AM\/NS India can play an active role and fully benefit from the anticipated growth in the Indian steel industry.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel complete acquisition of Essar Steel","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal announces that it has today completed the acquisition of Essar Steel India Limited (‘ESIL’), and simultaneously established a joint venture with Nippon Steel Corporation (‘Nippon Steel’), called ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Limited (‘AM\/NS India’), which will own and operate ESIL.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-and-nippon-steel-complete-acquisition\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

This puts ArcelorMittal amongst the top 11% of companies within our industry, and compares favourably against the Global average of C, Europe regional average of C, and the Metal smelting, refining & forming sector average of C.  Designed to harness the competitive spirit of business to raise ambition and spur action on corporate climate action, CDP scores thousands of companies that disclose climate data through its platform each year at the request of their corporate customers and investors.  The positive score reflects CDP’s assessment of ArcelorMittal’s ambition to significantly reduce its carbon footprint by 2050, our disclosure of climate related financial risks and opportunities, and our work on a broad portfolio of low-emissions technologies designed to reduce carbon emissions, including:    * Carbalyst – captures waste gases from the blast furnace and biologically convert it into bio-ethanol. The €120m launch project at ArcelorMittal Ghent is expected to be completed in 2020.   * IGAR – captures waste CO2 from the blast furnace and converts it into a synthetic gas that can be reinjected into the blast furnace in place of fossil fuels to reduce iron ore. An industrial pilot of this technology is being developed at ArcelorMittal Dunkirk in France.   * Torero – €40m investment to convert waste wood into bio-coal to displace the fossil fuel coal currently injected into the blast furnace. Our first large scale demonstration plant in ArcelorMittal Ghent is expected to be in operation by the end of 2020.   * Reducing iron ore with hydrogen – €65m investment at Hamburg site to increase the use of hydrogen for the direct reduction of iron ore.Carbon capture and storage – integrating breakthrough technologies to bring down the costs of capturing, purifying and liquifying CO2 from waste gases. Construction of a carbon capture and storage pilot project, 3D, will begin at ArcelorMittal Dunkirk in 2020 and will be able to capture 0.5 metric tons of CO2 an hour from steelmaking gases by 2021.   * Steligence solutions to aid the design and delivery of low carbon buildings   * S-in motion® range of solutions to reduce the weight of (electric) cars and trucks without compromising on strength, and our iCARe® specialist steels for electric motors.

{"id":6495,"text":"Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal. Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Steel is a material that has played a vital role in building the infrastructure of our world and much of what makes modern life more comfortable and accessible. As we now seek to transition to a more circular and sustainable world, I am convinced that steel has a central role to play and will continue to for decades to come. One of the miracles of steel is that it continues to evolve – half the grades of steel we are producing today didn’t exist ten years ago. And these new grades are being designed to meet expectations for lighter vehicles, new energy systems and more environmentally friendly buildings. That is why we define our purpose as ‘Inventing smarter steels for a better world’.   “Our website is an important point of contact with all our stakeholders including current and future employees, shareholders, customers, communities and civil society more broadly. It has been designed not only to incorporate new technologies and be easily navigable, but also to act as a central hub for all the work the company is doing to create value for our stakeholders. That includes: investing in new processes; inventing new steels for customers; improving efficiency through digitalisation; testing new technologies to reduce our carbon footprint; promoting policy suggestions that will support a transition to a low-carbon world; and offering exciting career opportunities to solve some of the world’s most complex problems.  “The steel industry, understandably, is often associated with the past. I hope this site will serve to reinforce how it is also a vital part of the future.”   A central pillar of the new website is its Smarter future section, which explores the future of steel and its role in a changing world. It includes four episodes from the first season of a new podcast series, ‘Futurising’, which features ArcelorMittal experts in conversation with a futurologist, covering:    * The future of mobility: Brian Aranha, head of automotive, discusses how mobility may change in the future.   * The future of steel manufacturing: Greg Ludkovsky, head of R&D, explores how steel manufacturing will be different in the future, and imagines its reinvention.   * The future of construction: Olivier Vassart, CEO Steligence®, discusses the future of buildings and the role of steel in them.   * Sustainability: Dr Alan Knight, head of sustainable development, reflects on the sustainable nature of steel, and how this positions it as the ideal material for a sustainable future.    The website contains case studies which outline how ArcelorMittal is embracing the latest technological trends and applying them across its business to deliver efficiency and environmental improvements. Examples include:    * How we are looking at all possible technology pathways to reduce our carbon footprint.   * How steels are supporting the global energy transition.   * How ArcelorMittal is making significant investments in resources, time and management attention to understand how it can take advantage of Industry 4.0, and use data and analytics to create value for its customers and to improve its performance.   * How ArcelorMittal’s global R&D team has developed a potato-based, biodegradable dust suppressant, applied as foam, which can reduce secondary sinter dust emissions by more than 80%.   * How artificial intelligence algorithms inspired by the path-finding behaviour of ant colonies in the wild has helped to improve production line scheduling, delivering cost, productivity and quality improvements.    The website also features a Making Steel infographic which outlines the entire steelmaking journey, from mining to ironmaking through to the use of steel in modern life. It also hosts a Corporate library which includes ArcelorMittal’s reporting hub and houses its policies and procedures.  The website can be accessed at http:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com.

{"id":6496,"text":"In a manifesto published today, ‘Creating a low carbon world, the case for a Carbon Border Adjustment’, ArcelorMittal sets out its firm belief that a CBA should be one of the first Green Deal measures adopted by the new European Commission, as it will help to create the market conditions and protections needed for companies to make investments and transition to carbon neutrality without disruption.  Currently within the EU, energy-intensive industries including steel producers, pay a carbon cost under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). But this does not apply to steel producers from markets outside the EU who can sell steel with comparable or often significantly higher, carbon emissions, at a lower price. The result is that steel production is moving to non-EU countries where carbon emissions legislation is often less strict, undermining efforts to combat climate change.   However, with a CBA, when steel comes into the EU, the carbon costs that European producers pay would be added to the imported steel, equalising the cost of carbon for every producer to create a fair market and, crucially, encouraging investment in lower-emissions steel production.  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products says: “The EU’s commitment to reduce its carbon emissions to net-zero should be applauded and we hope that decision makers across Europe will back the proposals as they really could hold the key to unlocking solutions that could put a stop to carbon emissions. The climate challenge is unprecedented, and bold action is needed.”  ArcelorMittal believes that a CBA can be applied in various ways, as long as it neutralizes the disparities in carbon costs between domestic products and imports, and incentivizes the transition to low carbon steel production. In the manifesto, ArcelorMittal highlights how the best-designed carbon border adjustment could work effectively:  Producers exporting to the EU should be charged the same marginal carbon emissions cost as European producers pay under the ETS. This should serve as a catalyst to other countries to introduce their own carbon schemes and invest in technologies to decarbonise.  The CBA should initially be applied to primary goods, rather than end products like household appliances and everyday tools. This is the most practical way to introduce the CBA.  To be effective, free allocation of ETS allowances, which are gradually being phased out by the European Commission, should be maintained in the first stage of the CBA, alongside compensation for high energy costs as an indirect result of the ETS. This is crucial to enabling European steel to stay competitive and ensure a smooth transition without disruption.  He says: “There are of course challenges that will need to be overcome. For example, some have argued that there is the risk of contravening international trade rules. However, the establishment of a border adjustment is compatible with international trade rules, allowing members to adopt measures necessary for the protection of the environment or relating to the conservation of natural resources providing that such measures do not constitute arbitrary discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail. But this will only work if the policies are well-designed and drafted in the right way.”   He also says: “We know we need to invest more to decarbonise our industry and we truly believe we can be a world leader in low carbon steel. But in order to do so, we need to have a CBA to create a landscape where others also contribute equally to a carbon-neutral world. The time to do this is now, with the proceeds allowing further investment in large-scale green technologies that lead to a new era of low carbon emissions.”   For more information, to read the manifesto and view our short animation on the CBA, see here:  https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/sustainability\/climate-action-in-europe  Contact information – ArcelorMittal Europe communications  [email protected]  +44 203 214 2876  [email protected]  +44 203 214 2882","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Europe’s proposed carbon border adjustment could hold the key to breakthrough on CO2 emissions reduction","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today calls for member states and MEPs to support the introduction of a carbon border adjustment (CBA), as part of the European Commission’s €1 trillion Green Deal, aimed at making the bloc carbon neutral by 2050.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/europe-s-proposed-carbon-border-adjustment-could-hold-the-key-to-breakthrough-on-co2-emissions-reduction\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6499,"text":"Firstly, we would like to recognise the resilience and flexibility of our global workforce, whose health and well-being is our first priority. Where possible, employees are working remotely from home. Where assets continue to operate, we are following the recommendations from government as well as the World Health Organisation (‘WHO’). We appreciate this brings new challenges for everyone and are working together as a community to support each other through these unprecedented times.   The global escalation of COVID-19 and the measures introduced by governments worldwide to contain the virus are negatively impacting economic activity and industrial supply chains in many parts of the world. Consequently, we are either seeing or expect to see a significant decline in industrial activity in many if not all of the geographic markets in which we operate, which is impacting our business.   In response we are reducing production and temporary idling steelmaking and finishing assets, adapted on a country by country basis in alignment with regional demand as well as government requirements. This will not necessarily happen uniformly at assets across the globe given the escalation of the virus is at different points in different regions. While Europe is currently the epicenter, according to official WHO data cases in the NAFTA region have now exceeded those in China, with cases also increasing in Africa, India, South America and the CIS. Where demand for our products continues, for example for food packaging, we will endeavour to maintain reduced operations to ensure we can meet customer’s requirements.  In order to mitigate the impact of the lower level of production we are implementing significant measures to preserve cash and reduce costs in-line with reduced production levels. This includes accessing measures introduced by governments to support companies throughout these unprecedented times. We are thankful to all governments for their swift introduction of such measures which will be critical to many industries as we navigate this period.   The current market volatility and uncertainty is tough for every country, every individual and every company. We are however buoyed by the fact our company has in recent years prioritised the strengthening of its balance sheet to provide a strong financial foundation in all market conditions. Net debt is at a record low, we have a very manageable debt maturity profile having used available cash to prepay debt in recent years and also benefit from a significant liquidity position. We intend to provide updated guidance on our 2020 cash requirements, including capital expenditure, when we announce our first quarter 2020 results on 7 May 2020. In order to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees, shareholders and stakeholders, we have however decided to postpone the AGM planned for 5 May 2020. A new date will be communicated in due course.   Like many in the private sector, we are attempting to harness our skills and resources in a useful and collaborative way to help address the challenges presented by COVID-19. Specifically, we have focussed our actions on collaborating to address the severe lack of the required safety and medical equipment, including face masks and ventilators. Our businesses across the world have now collectively donated to various initiatives. We have also been utilising our global network to help facilitate the transfer of equipment to and from regions most impacted. For example, in February we actively helped source masks for China. Now that China appears to have passed its peak, we are working with our associates there to help bring medical equipment to the countries now facing an escalation and particularly those, such as India and Liberia, that will struggle to source adequate supplies.  Furthermore, we have also been able to contribute the 3D printing expertise of our R&D team to a global effort focussed on developing a 3D printed ventilator prototype. This prototype will be tested imminently in hospitals and, if successful, will massively increase the ability to rapidly produce ventilators. We are now focussed on the prototype for a more advanced ventilator which also has the ability, in addition to providing lungs with oxygen, to feeding medicine incorporating AI algorithms.   Finally, where excess capacity exists, we are offering space to medical facilities to host additional wards. We are proud of the initiatives our employees are taking to provide social and humanitarian support during this time.

{"id":6508,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’), the world’s leading steel and mining company, has today published its 2019 integrated annual review, ‘Inventing smarter steels for a better world’. The review, which can be accessed at https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/corporate-library\/reporting-hub\/integrated-annual-review-2019, underpins the Company’s commitment to transparent reporting. It has been produced in-line with the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework and demonstrates the Company’s approach to ensuring it brings long-term, sustainable value to its broad stakeholder base.  The review provides an overview of the progress the Company made in 2019 and outlines how it is addressing its challenges. Specifically, the review details how ArcelorMittal performed last year across four distinct areas, namely: health and safety performance; delivering financial value; innovating smarter steels and solutions; and driving environmental and social sustainability.  Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “I am fundamentally optimistic about the long-term outlook for steel because, as the world’s population further increases and living standards continue to improve for everyone, demand for materials will also increase. Our product is also an integral component in much of the infrastructure that will support a net zero carbon economy, including wind and solar farms, electric vehicles and low-carbon buildings. But we also need to work to significantly reduce our direct carbon footprint. Beyond the challenge of trialling and scaling up potential technologies, the biggest hurdle will be the significantly higher costs which cannot be supported by the profitability of the industry alone. This is why policy intervention is so critical, both to provide access to finance as well as to ensure a level playing field.  “As steelmaking develops, it is important to also develop the skills of our employees and to ensure we can retain and attract the people we need for continued success. We have already strengthened our digitalisation teams and are also boosting our research and development teams with 3D printing experts as we explore the potential for printing steel from steel powders. We believe the steel industry offers interesting and complex challenges, and ArcelorMittal an entrepreneurial, global environment in which to grow and prosper.  “Undoubtedly there will be significant COVID-19 repercussions for some time to come. But I do expect the fundamentals to reassert themselves, for the world to continue with its development, to continue to grow, to continue to want to give a better quality of life to more people, and to continue to prioritise sustainability. There will be challenges, as there are always challenges, but steel has a critical role to play in the world of the future as it has in the world of the past. And I am sure ArcelorMittal, as the world’s leading and only global steel company, will continue to be a material supplier of choice, inventing smarter steels for the better world we all hope to see.”  Key highlights of ArcelorMittal’s sustainable development approach and progress discussed in the review include:    * The steps the Company is taking to address its carbon challenge, encapsulated in our commitment to supporting the objectives of the Paris Agreement, and our ambition to significantly reduce emissions across the group, including a 30% reduction in carbon emissions in Europe by 2030, and carbon neutrality in Europe by 2050.         * An overview of the first full year of Steligence®, our radical new concept for the use of steel in construction. This facilitates the next generation of high-performance buildings and sustainable construction techniques. It is already proving highly successful, having delivered 16 million m2 of building and nearly 500,000 tonnes of steel so far.         * The importance the Company places on R&D, insight into how our $301 million R&D budget was allocated in 2019 and a spotlight on our work with Canoo to create a disruptive new vehicle for a world in which transportation is becoming increasingly electric, shared and autonomous.         * How, in 2019, we avoided the emission of more than 11 million tonnes CO2 in the cement industry through the sale of 15 million tonnes of blast furnace slag for use as cement – 19% more than in 2018. In 2019, our absolute CO2e footprint for our steel and mining operations saw a 4% decrease against 2018, and for our steel operations, a 4.5% decrease.         * We are reducing our direct emissions from energy consumption. In 2019, 44% of our electricity was generated from renewable sources and through onsite generation.     * A summary of value creation for stakeholders in 2019, in the Company’s value creation model. Examples include:      * $72.2 billion economic contribution.     * $4.5 billion total tax contribution.     * $30.3 million total community investment spend.     * Allocated a total of $711 million to 25 projects with energy and\/or carbon benefits.     * Approved a total of 38 projects with environmental benefits totaling $692 million.     * 69 inventions newly protected and 42 sustainable products and solutions launched, 11 of which accelerate sustainable lifestyles and 31 of which support sustainable construction, infrastructure and energy generation.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes 2019 integrated annual review","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal publishes 2019 integrated annual review","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-publishes-2019-integrated-annual-review-1\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6509,"text":"The accolade for 2019 maintains ArcelorMittal’s perfect run as a Steel Sustainability Champion, since the programme was launched in 2017.

{"id":6510,"text":"* Europe’s largest steelmaker, unveils breakthrough technologies that will take the company to 30% lower CO2 emissions by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 2050     * ArcelorMittal Europe is investing in two routes to carbon neutrality, Smart Carbon and an innovative DRI-based route, in recognition of the need to act now to reduce CO2 emissions, in line with the EU’s Green Deal and the Paris Agreement   * Calls for new policy framework, to support the industry in its transition to carbon neutrality, naming five market conditions that are needed for Europe’s steelmakers to compete globally     ArcelorMittal Europe has announced details of how it plans to become carbon neutral by 2050 in its first climate action report, published today. Building on the company’s work that has demonstrated that the steelmaking process can become carbon neutral, the report publishes details of the ground-breaking work underway to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030 before reaching net zero in 2050.  The company is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral routes for steelmaking: Smart Carbon, and an innovative DRI-based route.  Smart Carbon is a carbon-neutral steelmaking route that leverages all clean energies – circular carbon, clean electricity and carbon capture and storage (CCS) - within the high temperature-controlled reduction environment of ironmaking. In its first phase, Smart Carbon will primarily use circular carbon.  Reaching carbon-neutral steelmaking via DRI involves moving from using predominantly natural gas, to hydrogen as the key reductant in ironmaking. As this hydrogen becomes ‘green’, the steelmaking process comes close to carbon neutrality.  While both the Smart Carbon route and the DRI-based route have the potential to deliver carbon -neutral steel by 2050, the important difference between the two routes is that Smart Carbon can deliver results sooner, through its use of complementary technologies which enable incremental progress. Uniquely, Smart Carbon has the potential not only to provide carbon-neutral steel, but also carbon-neutral cement, and the building blocks to make recycled carbon materials to replace polyethylene-based plastics. Smart Carbon can also contribute to CO2 removal, through the increased use of circular carbon, using sustainable biomass and waste, combined with scaling up CCS.  By investing in both routes – and in recognition of the need to act now to combat climate change - this means ArcelorMittal Europe can significantly reduce scope 1 CO2 emissions* – which include all process emissions - by 2030 over a 2018 baseline, while waiting for the large-scale, affordable renewable energy needed for hydrogen-based steelmaking.  ArcelorMittal Europe’s 2030 target therefore combines Smart Carbon technologies and increased scrap usage, specifically by developing new ways to increase the use of low-quality scrap metal – which is hard to recycle - in the primary steel production process.  In the longer-term, both routes have the potential to leverage all three clean energies to achieve carbon neutrality, namely:    * clean electricity (generated by sources such as solar and wind),   * circular carbon (making use of biowaste materials, such as sustainable forestry and agriculture residues, to produce bioenergy)   * carbon capture and storage (capturing CO2 before it is emitted, transporting it and storing it safely underground).    Commenting on the report, Aditya Mittal, President and CFO, ArcelorMittal, and CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said:  “Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing us all. Understandably, much attention is currently focussed on navigating the unexpected and unprecedented outbreak of Covid-19. However, climate change remains a huge long-term challenge that will require diligent attention and progress for decades to come. And like Covid-19, it is not something that one country or one company can solve alone. Carbon emissions also know no border, so it will take a global effort, with all nations and companies playing their part.  “ArcelorMittal Europe is doing a lot of work to develop a path to net zero. The technologies we are working on have the potential to make a big impact. Indeed, steel should and can play a leading role in achieving the vision for Europe as outlined in the Green Deal. Our research and development team are one of the best in the industry and relish solving complex problems. But it needs a team effort. The support the EU and member states can give to ensure we have well-designed policy to make large-scale, competitive, carbon-neutral steelmaking a reality, is critical.”  ArcelorMittal Europe has industrial-scale demonstration projects under construction for every part of its carbon-neutral roadmap. The company is building industrial-scale demonstration plants at its operations in Belgium (Carbalyst® and Torero), France (3D and IGAR in Dunkirk). In Hamburg, Germany, we are in the design and funding phase prior to the investment decision, of an industrial-scale project to use hydrogen instead of natural gas in the direct reduction of iron ore (DRI). These demonstration plants will allow the company to scale-up technologies that will be used in the Smart Carbon and DRI-based routes. The progress made has also been possible thanks to financial support from EU member states and European Union funding. ArcelorMittal Europe is now in the process of applying for funding for a further six projects.   While some of the technologies that feature in ArcelorMittal Europe’s roadmap will be ready for commercial-scale use by 2025, and by 2030 many of the Smart Carbon technologies can be mature and partially deployed across our facilities in Europe, the report also highlights the need for the right policy framework to enable European steelmaking to contribute to the EU’s climate targets, particularly given the costs involved. In total, the estimated investment needed for ArcelorMittal Europe to fully implement Smart Carbon is €15-25bn and €30-40bn for the DRI-based route. An additional €15–200bn would be required for the associated clean energy infrastructure (see report for more detail).  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, explained:  “I am proud of the work that has brought us this far in our efforts to create Europe’s first and largest carbon-neutral steelmaker. Our progress would not have been possible without the many partners we have on our Smart Carbon and innovative DRI projects. Today, the biggest barrier to transitioning to carbon-neutral steel, beyond the necessary technologies reaching commercial maturity, is the absence of the right market conditions. The financial costs of realising carbon-neutral steelmaking are undeniably huge. However, with a shift in market conditions brought about by having the right policies in place, European steelmakers will be able to unlock the means to reduce emissions from steel globally, while also ensuring the European steel industry remains competitive.”  The medium-term market conditions needed include:    1. Creating an environment where carbon-neutral steel is more competitive than steel which is not carbon neutral         2. A fair competitive landscape that accounts for the global nature of the steel market, addressing domestic, import and export steel dynamics, as well as the distinction between primary and secondary sources to make steel.         3. Access to sustainable finance, to innovate and make long-term investments.         4. Access to abundant, affordable clean energy: the scale of the steel industry’s energy needs are such that concerted cross-sector and government efforts will be required to develop the necessary clean energy infrastructure.         5. Public instruments to accelerate innovative technology deployment to transition to carbon neutral steelmaking.    The report also reiterates the company’s position that a Carbon Border Adjustment should be introduced in the European Union, which would ensure that EU-produced steel and imported steel tonnes in direct competition would have an equal carbon cost, creating a fair market and, crucially, encouraging investment in lower-emissions steel production.  ArcelorMittal Europe announced its target to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, in December 2019, and its ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050, in June 2019.  The ArcelorMittal group will publish its 2030 target later this year.   *ArcelorMittal Europe 30% CO2 reduction target includes: ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products, and Industeel  To read the report and view a short film about our roadmap, visit https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/sustainability\/climate-action-in-europe  To view our Carbon Border Adjustment animation, ‘Creating a low-carbon world, the case for a Carbon Border Adjustment’ visit https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T-iJeVoa7w0","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe sets out path to net zero by 2050, with pioneering technologies at the forefront of the company’s roadmap for carbon-neutral steelmaking","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe sets out path to net zero by 2050, with pioneering technologies at the forefront of the company’s roadmap for carbon-neutral steelmaking","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-sets-out-path-to-net-zero-by-2050-with-pioneering-technologies-at-the-forefront-of-the-company-s-roadmap-for-carbon-neutral-steelmaking\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The Deal of the Year award recognises the challenges, financial results, leadership, scope and strategic vision of asset buyouts, joint ventures, strategic company alliances or full company mergers or acquisitions, as well as strategic spin-offs that strengthened organisations. The awards program, hosted by S&P Global Platts, the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodities and energy markets, saw 96 finalists from 23 countries vie for recognition in 15 categories.  AM\/NS India's acquisition of Essar Steel India stood out for the Deal of the Year award as it was the largest private-sector transaction to close in India during 2019, and the second-largest steel transaction globally that year.  ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel faced intense competition from other interested parties in Essar, as well as a multiplicity of legal challenges in India, even at the Supreme Court.  Confident of the strong strategic rationale for the transaction and the potential for the partners to turn around Essar Steel, AM\/NS India remained committed and resolute throughout the 865-day long process, emerging as the winner of an auction with all legal obstacles resolved.  The acquisition provides both ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel a sizeable entry into the high-growth Indian steel market, where steel consumption is expected to grow on average around 6% annually over the next 10-15 years. Neither joint venture partner had any production capability in India before the acquisition.

{"id":6516,"text":"Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal said:  “An electric arc furnace at Calvert makes strategic sense as it allows our asset to be more reactive to the local market as well as being in line with the USMCA. Furthermore, it aligns with our ambition of producing smarter steels for a better world.”  Commenting, Brad Davey, CEO, ArcelorMittal North America said:  “The addition of an EAF at AM\/NS Calvert presents a transformational opportunity for what is already widely considered to be the world’s most advanced steel finishing facility. This is a logical next step in optimizing AM\/NS Calvert’s supply chain. Enhancing our already highly competitive lead times with short lead-time flexibility, combined with our existing world class facilities will give AM\/NS Calvert a decisive competitive advantage. In addition, the USMCA trade agreement is a “game changer” for former NAFTA and as a result, future steel supply chains for the automotive markets will be required to use steel that was created within North America. A new EAF at AM\/NS Calvert will further secure ArcelorMittal’s leadership in the North American Automotive market.”  AM\/NS Calvert is the world’s most advanced steel finishing facility and further demonstrates the highly successful partnership between ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel Corporation. AM\/NS Calvert was originally built by Thyssenkrupp, with a total investment cost ~$4B USD and was acquired by ArcelorMittal and NSC as a 50:50 JV in 2014. The J\/V has already invested more than $200M USD in strategic projects invested in Calvert since its acquisition. These capabilities, geographic location in combination with the new EAF will position the facility well for meeting automotive and energy market demand well into the future.  ### Press Contacts  North America: Bill Steers; +1 312 899 3817; [email protected]","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal announces intention to build an EAF at AM\/NS Calvert","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Today, ArcelorMittal announced its intention to build an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steel making facility at AM\/NS Calvert.

{"id":6517,"text":"We believe pursuing both routes to carbon neutrality is an advantage, as it means we can significantly reduce our scope 1 CO2 emissions, which include all process emissions, by 2030, without having to wait for the large-scale, affordable, renewable energy needed for hydrogen-based steelmaking. Urgent action to reduce CO2 emissions is needed within the next decade, and with our roadmap to 2030, we recognise that the time is now.  Having the right policies to support Europe’s steel industry to become carbon neutral is paramount. ArcelorMittal Europe therefore welcomes the European Commission’s policy proposals, outlined in its 2030 Climate Target Plan announced on 17 September 2020, which – if successfully implemented – will provide a supportive policy framework for the company to achieve its climate targets.   We believe there are four key policy enablers that are needed, to provide the legislative platform for ArcelorMittal Europe to achieve its climate targets:  1\\. The Carbon Border Adjustment - a key policy mechanism for decarbonisation, while also creating a fair competitive landscape by aligning the carbon costs of EU domestic steel producers with that of imports.   Therefore, the European Commission’s announcement that a legislative proposal will be made in 2021 to introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA) Mechanism, is a significant step forward in recognising that a supportive policy framework is needed as soon as possible. The CBA can be designed in a WTO-compatible way, a fact that we hope will ensure a CBA is implemented swiftly.  2\\. Access to abundant and affordable clean energy, to enable the roll-out of low-emissions steelmaking.   The EC’s proposals in its 2030 Climate Target Plan, to further increase the EU’s share of renewable energy by making it easier for member states to work together and deploy renewable energy projects, is encouraging.  3\\. Access to sustainable finance for low-emissions steelmaking.   We are hopeful that our submissions for funding from the newly-created ETS Innovation Fund are successful, and welcome the EU’s plan to develop a reliable EU Green Bond Standard.  4\\. Accelerate the transition to a circular economy: EU climate and materials policy should be integrated, taking a lifecycle perspective to ensure that materials are used in a circular way as much as possible.   The European Commission’s announcement yesterday that it wants to make Europe a leader in the circular economy is therefore positive progress.  As the Commission works on the detail of its Green Deal over the coming weeks, we hope that the final proposals recognise the value of steel to modern society, as an infinitely recyclable material that has the proven potential to be made with zero emissions.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal welcomes European Commission’s policy proposals to support new emissions reduction target   ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe is working intensively to achieve its target of reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, with an ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050.

{"id":6521,"text":"Commenting on the 2050 net zero target, before speaking about the challenge of decarbonising the steel industry at the Financial Times Commodities Conference today, Aditya Mittal, President and CFO, said:   “If the world is to achieve net zero by 2050 it will require all parts of the economy in all regions of the world to contribute. As the world’s leading steel company, we believe we have a responsibility to lead the efforts to decarbonise the steel-making process, which today has a significant carbon footprint.   “Steel will remain a vital material for our world and indeed is the most circular of all materials. Our challenge is to be able to make steel using clean energy technologies* on a commercial scale, while remaining competitive in the global steel industry.  “We are working on various pilot technologies which have excellent potential. In Hamburg, where we own and operate Europe’s only DRI-EAF facility, we will test not only the ability of hydrogen to reduce the iron-ore and form DRI, but also then test that carbon-free DRI in the EAF in the actual steel-making process.  “Hydrogen has a lot of potential but given the significant transition cost, we also believe in working on solutions for the traditional integrated route. This essentially follows the bio-energy, carbon capture and utilisation and storage route, which as stressed by both the IPCC and the IEA will be critical to achieving net zero by 2050. What is also interesting about this route is that it has the potential not only to provide carbon neutral steel, but also other products that will help the chemical industry make plastics in a carbon neutral way.   “Critical to turning the target into reality will be policy to enable steel to remain competitive while decarbonizing – particularly given every region of the world is moving at a different pace. We intend to actively engage with governments to chart a way forward that enables the steel industry to make meaningful progress through carefully designed policy that protects against carbon leakage.”  ArcelorMittal has identified two low-emissions steelmaking routes, both of which have the potential to lead to carbon-neutral steelmaking:    * The Hydrogen-DRI route, which uses hydrogen as a reducing agent. A demonstration plant in Hamburg, where ArcelorMittal owns Europe’s only operational DRI-EAF plant, is currently planned with a targeted start-up in 2023.     * The Smart Carbon route is centred around modifying the blast furnace route to create carbon neutral steelmaking through the use of circular carbon - in the form of sustainable biomass or carbon containing waste streams - and carbon capture and use (CCU) and storage (CCS). ArcelorMittal is well advanced on constructing several commercial-scale projects to test and prove a range of Smart Carbon technologies. Start-up target for key projects is targeted in 2022.    While both routes have the potential to deliver carbon-neutral steel by 2050, we believe that Smart Carbon can deliver results sooner, and make a meaningful contribution to CO2 emissions reduction this decade, while industrial scale production from the Hydrogen-DRI route is unlikely to be significant before 2030 due to the current high costs.  The Company has also previously outlined the policy framework environment it believes is required for carbon-neutral steelmaking to become a reality, which includes:    1. A global level playing field which avoids the risk of carbon leakage through mechanisms such as green border adjustments   2. Access to abundant and affordable clean energy   3. Policies which support the development of the necessary clean energy infrastructure   4. Access to sustainable finance for low-emissions steelmaking, and   5. Policies which accelerate the transition to a circular economy.    ArcelorMittal will set out further detail in support of its 2050 net zero target in its second climate action report, which is anticipated to be published before the end of 2020.  ArcelorMittal is a member of the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) and is an active member of the ETC’s Net Zero Steel Initiative underway in partnership with the World Economic Forum. ArcelorMittal is also actively engaged with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) to define an achievable SBT for the steel industry taking into account the two distinct routes in operation today.  *In its Climate Action Report and Europe Climate Action Report, ArcelorMittal refers to three clean energy vectors: clean electricity, circular carbon, and CCS.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal sets 2050 group carbon emissions target of net zero ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces a group-wide commitment to being carbon neutral by 2050, building on the commitment made in 2019 for its European business to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030, and be carbon neutral by 2050.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-sets-2050-group-carbon-emissions-target-of-net-zero\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

ArcelorMittal Europe is developing a series of industrial-scale hydrogen projects for use in blast furnace-based steelmaking that will start to deliver substantial CO2 emissions savings even within the next five years, as well as progressing a project to test the ability of hydrogen to reduce iron ore and form DRI on an industrial scale.   Ultimately to reach zero, this hydrogen will need to be ‘green’ (produced via electrolysis which is powered by renewable electricity). ArcelorMittal is therefore developing new facilities to produce green hydrogen using electrolysers. Teams at ArcelorMittal Bremen in Germany are working on the first large-scale deployment of this technology which can then be deployed in both the blast furnace and the DRI-EAF route. Previously, this emerging technology has only been tested at small pilot plants in Europe.  1\\. Hydrogen and the blast furnace    * ArcelorMittal Bremen    By installing an electrolyser, hydrogen can be produced and injected in large volumes into the blast furnace tuyeres. The project will reduce the volumes of coal needed in the iron ore reduction process, thereby cutting CO2 emissions.    * IGAR in Dunkirk    At ArcelorMittal Dunkirk, the company is developing a hybrid blast furnace process, which involves using DRI gas injection technology in the blast furnace shaft as well as using gas injection in the blast furnace tuyeres, using plasma technology to create a reducing gas. This is the first large-scale implementation of what is essentially a hybrid BF\/DRI technology. In due course it will enable green hydrogen to be injected into the blast furnace as it becomes available.     * Blast furnace injection across Flat Products sites     ArcelorMittal Europe is also implementing projects in almost all its Flat Products sites to use gases from different sources for blast furnace injection. Injecting hydrogen-rich coke oven gas is an efficient, cost effective method that allows steelmakers to reduce CO2 emissions now. ArcelorMittal Asturias has the most advanced coke oven gas project, with injection of grey hydrogen (hydrogen that has been recovered from gases including natural gas and coke oven gas) due to start in early 2021.  2\\. Hydrogen and DRI-EAF    * Testing hydrogen to reduce iron ore and form DRI, at ArcelorMittal Hamburg    ArcelorMittal Europe owns Europe’s only DRI-EAF facility in Hamburg, where a project is planned to test the ability of hydrogen to reduce iron ore and form DRI on an industrial scale, as well as testing carbon-free DRI in the EAF steelmaking process.    * Large-scale DRI plant being studied for Dunkirk    At ArcelorMittal Dunkirk a study has been launched to build a large-scale DRI plant, combined with an electric arc furnace. Initially, the DRI installation would use natural gas but ArcelorMittal’s unique experience in DRI production, together with the results of the DRI-hydrogen project in Hamburg mean the DRI installation will be fully ‘hydrogen-ready’.  SMART CARBON WITH HYDROGEN    * Second Carbalyst plant planned, in Fos-sur-Mer; further CO2 cuts with large electrolyser for hydrogen injection    ArcelorMittal is also planning to expand its use of the Smart Carbon technology route. At ArcelorMittal Fos-sur-Mer, France, a study is underway in collaboration with partner Lanzatech, to build a second Carbalyst plant in addition to the one under construction at ArcelorMittal Ghent in Belgium. This involves carbon capture from the blast furnace waste gas, and biologically converting it into ethanol for use as a biofuel or recycled carbon feedstock for the chemical industry. In parallel with the company’s electrolyser project in Bremen, the Carbalyst plant in Fos-sur-Mer will boost CO2 savings through hydrogen injection, supplied by a large-scale electrolyser that will produce the hydrogen locally from renewable electricity.  First verified green steel for customers  The first impact of these decarbonisation efforts means ArcelorMittal Europe will be offering customers green steel products this year, when the first 30,000 tonnes will be ready.  A system that quantifies the CO2 emissions savings made thanks to the decarbonisation projects being rolled out by ArcelorMittal Europe has been developed. Customers will be able to buy green steel, based on verified emissions compared with a 2018 baseline.   Innovation Fund submissions  To fund the capital investment needed for the projects announced today, ArcelorMittal Europe is preparing funding applications to the EU’s Innovation Fund which is designed to support low-carbon investments in the European Union.   Aditya Mittal, President and CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said:   \"Today we are providing an important update on our progress in achieving our target of reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, including the vital role that hydrogen has in our strategy. Our talented teams across ArcelorMittal Europe are working hard to ensure our CO2 emissions reduction projects deliver results as fast as possible, on an industrial scale. We are focussed on being ready for the hydrogen economy and the exciting opportunities this presents for us as European steelmakers.   “In parallel we continue to roll out our Smart Carbon technology which we are convinced also offers huge potential given the world will need so-called BECCS technologies (bio-energy, carbon capture and storage) to reach net zero by 2050.   “Our plans to offer greener and more circular steel will support our customers in their circular economy objectives. We are pleased to be able to offer our first green tonnes this year and look forward to being able to provide customers with larger volumes of this steel as our decarbonisation projects are ramped up and rolled out across Europe.  “We are in the process of applying for funding for various projects from the ETS Innovation Fund which we hope will be successful, giving us the vital access to finance that we need for these important projects. The success of these projects will also be secured through partnerships, and we would like to thank our partners for their hard work and willingness to co-develop the new technologies we need to make carbon-neutral steel.”  ArcelorMittal Europe climate action report  In June 2020, ArcelorMittal Europe published its first climate action report which outlined the company’s strategy for reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.  In the report the company identified two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology routes, Smart Carbon and innovative DRI based on hydrogen, that will help the company reach its CO2 reduction targets.

{"id":6533,"text":"ArcelorMittal has once again been recognised by CDP for its strong performance in corporate transparency and action on climate change. ArcelorMittal successfully retained its A- score in the 2020 CDP Climate Change assessment, putting the company within the top quartile of all metal smelting, refining and forming companies and the top 10% of the steel industry.  CDP, a not-for-profit charity that runs a global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions, scores thousands of companies which disclose climate data through its platform each year. By doing so, the competitive spirit of business to raise ambition and spur action on corporate climate action is harnessed for positive change.   ArcelorMittal’s A- grade is testament to the company’s efforts and contributions towards building a thriving economy that works for people and the planet in the long term. The grade compares favourably to the global average D grade for metal smelting, refining and forming companies, and C grade for the steel sector specifically. ArcelorMittal’s efforts are further reflected in the A grade scores achieved for governance, disclosure of climate related financial risk and opportunities, strategy and planning and emissions reduction initiatives.  Earlier this year, the company announced a group-wide commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2050, while it is targeting a reduction of 30% by 2030 in its European business. ArcelorMittal recognises the important role of disclosing climate related financial risks and opportunities in achieving this goal, as well as developing the company’s two low-emissions technology pathways, Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI.  Commenting, Brian Aranha, Executive Vice President and Head of Strategy, CTO, R&D, CCM, Global Automotive, Communications and Corporate Responsibility, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Receiving an A- from CDP for the second consecutive year is testament to the significant efforts we are making to lead the industry’s efforts to decarbonise steelmaking. Having previously outlined our commitment to the objectives of the Paris agreement, earlier this year we set ourselves the target of being carbon neutral by 2050. To achieve this, we are developing a broad range of ground-breaking, low-emissions steelmaking technologies, with several industrial-scale projects across our European operations at an advanced stage. Our target is ambitious and will be challenging. Meeting it will require a supportive policy framework, but the progress with have made with our technologies provides us with confidence that we are on the right path.”  The full list of companies assessed, as well as other publicly available climate change scores are available on CDP’s website at: https:\/\/www.cdp.net\/en\/companies\/companies-scores","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal ranked at global leadership level on climate action","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Company maintains A- CDP grade for second consecutive year","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-ranked-at-global-leadership-level-on-climate-action\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6538,"text":"Vow subsidiary ETIA and ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products, a leader in the production of sections, sheet piles, rails and quality wire rod, will work together to build the first dedicated biogas plant for the steel industry, using ETIA’s pyrolysis technology, at ArcelorMittal Rodange in Luxembourg. ArcelorMittal Rodange specializes in the production of grooved rails, supplying major rail projects around the world.  The two companies will cooperate on engineering, business models and financing, and aim to have the Rodange biogas plant operational in 2023. The biogas will be made using Vow’s patented ‘Biogreen’ pyrolysis technology, which involves heating sustainable biomass at high temperatures. The gases emitted during this process are then captured and processed into biogas, which will directly replace the use of natural gas in the Rodange plant’s rolling mill reheating furnace. By-products such as bio-coal will also be created during the process, and re-used within ArcelorMittal, directly replacing the use of coal.  The Rodange biogas plant will be ETIA’s first industrial-scale pilot project for this specific application, and the intention is for similar plants to be built in Europe, thereby increasing the CO2 emissions saved from replacing the use of natural gas.  “We are very pleased to be working with VOW ASA, combining our expertise as steelmakers with Vow and ETIA technology, to create this biogas plant for ArcelorMittal Rodange. We see significant potential in the use of biogas as a replacement for natural gas within ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products’ facilities, and in helping us to achieve our ambition of being carbon-neutral by 2050. This technically challenging project is truly ground-breaking, in its ability to create synthetic gas for industrial use, from sustainable biomass.” said Vincent Cholet, CTO of ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products.  “We are very excited and committed to this cooperation, helping ArcelorMittal on their mission towards a CO2-neutral future in steel production. We see this as the beginning of a prosperous long-term collaboration”, said the CEO of Vow ASA Henrik Badin.  ArcelorMittal Europe has committed to reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030 and has an ambition to be carbon-neutral by 2050. The company is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology routes as part of its strategy: Smart Carbon and innovative DRI. The Long Products business owns Europe’s only DRI-EAF facility in Hamburg, where a project is planned to test the ability of hydrogen to reduce iron ore and form DRI on an industrial scale, as well as testing carbon-free DRI in the EAF steelmaking process.

{"id":6540,"text":"Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal said:  “Despite the obvious challenges of 2020, ArcelorMittal starts 2021 in a position of comparative strength. Having achieved some key strategic targets, this seems like the right moment to transition to Executive Chairman and the Board unanimously agree that Aditya Mittal is the natural and right choice to be the company’s Chief Executive. We have worked closely together since he joined the company in 1997, indeed in recent years we have effectively been managing the company together. He has an unrivalled knowledge of the business and a keen sense of how the company must continue to transform to remain the world’s leading steel company. As Chief Executive, he will be taking on the effective day to day running of the company, but we will continue to work very closely together and I remain as fascinated, engaged and committed to the company’s long-term success as ever. I am looking forward to this next chapter.”  Aditya Mittal said:  “It is an honour to be appointed Chief Executive of ArcelorMittal. Mr Mittal built ArcelorMittal from a greenfield rolling mill in Indonesia to become the world’s leading steel company. It is an extraordinary achievement and I am privileged to have witnessed and been part of so much of that journey. I’m excited about what lies ahead. ArcelorMittal is full of incredible people, a company with excellent knowledge and capabilities and a company with tremendous potential.  “The world is transforming at a very rapid pace and this change brings challenges but also many opportunities for ArcelorMittal. The biggest challenge, but also the biggest opportunity, will be to demonstrate that steel can decarbonise and indeed is the perfect material for a circular economy. This will undoubtedly be a critical driver of our strategy in the coming years and decades. That Mr Mittal will remain very involved as Executive Chairman is a great advantage – his wisdom, knowledge and insight will be invaluable and I look forward to us continuing to work very closely together for many years to come.”  Bruno Lafont, Lead Independent Non-Executive Director, said:  “This is a well-planned transition and I would expect it be very smooth. Aditya Mittal is without a doubt the right candidate to be the next Chief Executive of ArcelorMittal. His knowledge and experience of the company is second-to-none and this step reflects the role he has increasingly performed in recent years. He has impressed the Board with his forensic knowledge of the business, his leadership skills in all market conditions and his knowledge of the sustainability trends that are shaping and changing the way the global economy operates. We are delighted that Lakshmi Mittal wants to remain fully involved. Over 45 years he created the world’s leading steel company from scratch and has arguably played a more influential role in driving progress in the industry than any other individual. With Mr Mittal as Executive Chairman and Aditya Mittal as Chief Executive, supported by strong segment and function leaders, ArcelorMittal is well positioned to succeed in the coming decade and beyond.”  As a result of these developments, Genuino Christino will become Chief Financial Officer. Mr Christino joined the company in 2003 and has held the position of Head of Finance since 2016.  BACKGROUND   Lakshmi Mittal founded what became ArcelorMittal in 1976 when he built a greenfield rolling mill in Indonesia. An early believer in the benefits consolidation could bring to the steel industry, he took his first international step in 1989 with the lease and subsequent acquisition of a steel company in Trinidad & Tobago. This was followed by expansion into Mexico, the USA, Germany, Kazakhstan and multiple eastern European countries. In 2004 Mr Mittal combined his two steel businesses, Ispat International and LNM Holdings to form Mittal Steel, while at the same time agreeing to merge with International Steel Group of the United States. This combination meant Mittal Steel became the world’s largest steel company, a position that was further reinforced in 2006 when Mittal Steel and Arcelor agreed to merge to create ArcelorMittal. Mr Mittal is widely recognized for his entrepreneurial and business success and has received numerous awards. He sits on the board of Goldman Sachs.  Aditya Mittal joined Ispat International in 1997 from Credit Suisse where he worked in the investment banking division. His first task was to oversee the IPO of Ispat International on the New York Stock Exchange. He subsequently became Head of M&A, leading the company’s expansion into Eastern Europe. As CFO of LNM Holdings he led the combination of Ispat International with LNM to form Mittal Steel, of which he became CFO. He identified the opportunity of combining Arcelor and Mittal Steel and led the merger offer which culminated in the creation of ArcelorMittal. As well as being CFO of ArcelorMittal he took up operational responsibilities, first as CEO ArcelorMittal Americas and then as CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe. He was named President in 2018.  Genuino Christino joined Cia. Belgo Mineira in Brazil (currently ArcelorMittal Brazil) in 2003 from KPMG where he worked as an external auditor and consultant for over 10 years in Brazil and in the UK. He was transferred to our head office in Luxembourg in 2009 and has progressively taken over additional responsibilities within finance becoming Head of Finance in 2016. He has been working closely with Aditya on developing and executing the Group's financial strategy.

{"id":6543,"text":"ArcelorMittal Asturias has completed its coke-oven gas injection project for Blast Furnace B in its Gijón plant, a strategic step to reduce CO2 emissions and operational costs, thanks to lower coke consumption.  ArcelorMittal Europe has a target to reduce its CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, and an ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050. To achieve this target, ArcelorMittal Europe has two main technological pathways, innovative DRI and Smart Carbon, which were presented in the company’s first Climate Action Report, published in June 2020. Innovative DRI involves the use of hydrogen for the direct reduction of iron ore (to produce direct reduced iron, DRI), for use in both electric arc furnaces and blast furnaces. Smart Carbon is a carbon-neutral steel production path that makes use of all clean energies (circular carbon, clean electricity and carbon capture and storage (CCS)) in a controlled high-temperature reduction environment for the production of hot metal. In the first stage, the Smart Carbon path will basically use circular carbon, expanding to become hydrogen Smart Carbon when green hydrogen is widely available and affordable.  The Smart Carbon approach, as applied in the projects that the Company is working on at its European Flat Products sites, allows gases from various sources to be injected into the blast furnace. The injection of coke-oven gas, with high hydrogen content, is an effective and cost-efficient method that enables steel producers to reduce CO2 emissions immediately. ArcelorMittal Asturias has completed the most advanced project in the Company, linked to the use of coke-oven gas, and has initiated the injection of grey hydrogen (hydrogen recovered from various gases, including natural gas and coke-oven gas) into Blast Furnace B.

{"id":6548,"text":"This partnership is the first step towards the creation of a new low-carbon hydrogen and CO2 capture technologies ecosystem in this major industrial basin.  Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal have signed an MoU that aims to contribute significantly to the decarbonization of the Dunkirk industrial basin. In the context of the Paris Agreement and the European Commission’s Green Deal, and in line with Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal’s commitments to energy transition, the project will reduce yearly CO2 emissions from ArcelorMittal’s steel-making facilities in Dunkirk by 2.85 Mt by 2030. Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal have jointly applied for large projects funding under the Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) scheme for hydrogen. Funding from European and\/or French schemes supporting decarbonization is key to the implementation of the project.  ArcelorMittal is ready to implement an innovative production unit on its Dunkirk site, combining two steel production technologies – DRI: direct reduced iron unit, and submerged arc furnace – in dimensions never seen before. As a low-carbon technology, the DRI and submerged arc furnace unit will enable the production of steel with lower CO2 emissions. This initiative was the subject of a preliminary study announced by ArcelorMittal last October. It comes in addition to the initiatives already implemented by ArcelorMittal on its Dunkirk site to lower its CO2 emissions.  Air Liquide will support this strategic initiative through the massive supply of low-carbon hydrogen and the implementation of CO2 capture technologies in Dunkirk, one of Air Liquide's historical industrial basins in France. The Air Liquide group has developed a unique expertise both for hydrogen all along the value chain, from production and storage to distribution, as well as CO2 capture technologies. Leveraging this know-how and in line with its Climate objectives, Air Liquide is committed to developing sustainable solutions supporting its customers in the steel industry to reduce carbon emissions.  This partnership between Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal is a first step towards the creation of an ecosystem at the forefront of low-carbon hydrogen and CO2 capture solutions that will be a source of competitiveness and attractiveness for various players in the Dunkirk industrial and port basin.  François Jackow, Executive Vice-President of Air Liquide and a member of the Executive Committee supervising Europe Industries activities, said:  \"Decarbonizing the Industry is at the heart of Air Liquide’s strategy and we are committed to accompanying our customers with a wide range of innovative solutions.

{"id":6549,"text":"ArcelorMittal today announces the launch of its first three XCarb™ initiatives, as part of the company’s journey to deliver on its 2050 net zero commitment.  XCarb™ will ultimately bring together all of ArcelorMittal’s reduced, low and zero-carbon products and steelmaking activities, as well as wider initiatives and green innovation projects, into a single effort focused on achieving demonstrable progress towards carbon neutral steel.  To support its launch, ArcelorMittal today announces three XCarb™ branded initiatives:    * Our ‘XCarb™ green steel certificates’, which will enable us to support our customers as they seek to reduce their Scope 3 emissions;   * ‘XCarb™ recycled and renewably produced’ pioneering products for customers;   * Our ‘XCarb™ innovation fund’.    Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Climate change is an overwhelming societal priority. At ArcelorMittal, we have an important role to play in helping society deliver the objectives of the Paris Agreement and are determined to lead our industry’s transition to carbon neutral steel.  “We have the scale, resources and technological prowess to make a significant impact, and have already identified the routes to carbon neutral steelmaking through our Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI pathways.  “Our launch of XCarb™ today brings the full breadth of our decarbonisation activity together under a single umbrella brand. It aims to demonstrate to stakeholders the diverse range of initiatives we are undertaking in pursuit of our 2050 net zero goal while also providing our customers with solutions which help them address their own carbon reduction targets, demonstrating the important role steel has to play in a future, circular economy.”   The first XCarb™ initiatives to be launched are as follows:  ‘XCarb™ green steel certificates’  Across our ArcelorMittal Europe - Flat Products operations, we are investing in a broad range of initiatives to reduce carbon emissions from the blast furnace. These initiatives range from our flagship Smart Carbon projects, such as Torero (transforming biomass into bio-coal to replace the use of coal in the blast furnace) and Carbalyst (capturing carbon-rich blast furnace waste gas and converting it into bio-ethanol, which can then be used to make low-carbon chemical products) to capturing hydrogen-rich waste gases from the steelmaking process and injecting them into the blast furnace to reduce coal use.  These effort-intensive investments result in considerable CO2 savings, which can be passed onto customers in the form of the steel industry’s first-ever certification scheme. CO2 savings are aggregated, independently assured, and then converted into XCarb™ green steel certificates using a conversion factor that represents the average CO2 intensity of integrated steelmaking in Europe. The scheme therefore provides customers with the opportunity to buy certificates attached to their physical orders of steel, enabling them to report a reduction in their Scope 3 carbon emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The company anticipates it will have 600,000 tonnes of equivalent green steel tonnes available by the end of 2022.  ‘XCarb™ recycled and renewably produced’  ‘XCarb™ recycled and renewably produced’ has been designed for products made via the Electric Arc Furnace (‘EAF’) route using scrap steel. Recycled and renewably produced means that the physical steel was made with recycled material (scrap) using renewable electricity, giving it an extremely low CO2 footprint that can be as low as approximately 300kg of CO2 per tonne of finished steel when the metallics are 100% scrap. This customer offer is for both flat and long products. The electricity used in the steelmaking process is independently verified, with a ‘Guarantee of Origin’ given that it is from renewable sources.  ‘XCarb™ innovation fund’  ArcelorMittal has launched an innovation fund which will invest up to $100 million annually in groundbreaking companies developing pioneering or breakthrough technologies that will accelerate the steel industry’s transition to carbon neutral steelmaking. To be eligible for funding, companies will have to be developing technologies which support ArcelorMittal on its journey to decarbonise. The technology also needs to be commercially scalable.

{"id":6551,"text":"Using green hydrogen, up to 3.5 million tonnes of steel could be produced by the Bremen and Eisenhuttenstadt sites by 2030, with significantly lower CO2 emissions. Depending on the amount of hydrogen available, CO2 savings of more than 5 million tonnes could be possible. The technology conversion requires investments in the range of €1-1.5 billion.  \"With our concept for the transformation of the plants in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, we are accelerating the implementation of carbon-neutral steel production. These projects have the potential to have a significant impact in reducing CO2 emissions, in line with the European Union’s climate commitments. We are now asking for the necessary support and access to funding, to make the implementation of our plans happen \" said Reiner Blaschek, CEO of ArcelorMittal Flachstahl Deutschland.  In Germany, the group already operates Europe’s only DRI-EAF plant in Hamburg, where the switch to using hydrogen instead of natural gas in the iron ore reduction process is being prepared. The objective is to reach industrial commercial maturity of the technology by 2025, initially producing 100,000 tonnes of sponge iron a year.  Background  To implement the projects, ArcelorMittal is planning to gradually adapt production in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt in order to be able to competitively manufacture carbon-neutral, high-quality steel using hydrogen in the iron ore reduction process.  This year, two blast furnaces – one in Bremen and one in Eisenhuttenstadt - will be converted to inject natural gas, reducing the use of coal in the iron ore reduction process and thereby further reducing CO2 emissions.  As a next step, innovative DRI-EAF plants are to be set up at both locations. In Bremen, ArcelorMittal initially plans to use natural gas for the DRI, and later hydrogen from electrolysis; the hydrogen is to be made available as part of the regional North German Clean Hydrogen Coastline network. The sponge iron produced in the Bremen DRI unit will initially supply the steelworks in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, until the regional hydrogen cluster in East Brandenburg can also supply the Eisenhüttenstadt site with sufficient hydrogen. In the transition phase, the additional hydrogen required in Eisenhüttenstadt will be generated from natural gas with the help of a pyrolysis plant that will be built on the steel plant’s premises. To secure the future supply of hydrogen, both sites are to be integrated into the European hydrogen network in the long term via the regional hydrogen networks.  ArcelorMittal has set itself the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 30 percent by 2030 in Europe and producing carbon-neutral steel by 2050. To this end, ArcelorMittal is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology routes, Smart Carbon and an innovative DRI-based route.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal plans major investment in German sites, to accelerate CO2 emissions reduction strategy and leverage the hydrogen grid  ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal is planning to build a large-scale industrial plant for the direct reduction of iron ore (DRI) and electric arc furnace (EAF)-based steelmaking at its site in Bremen, as well as an innovative DRI pilot plant in addition to an electric arc furnace (EAF) in Eisenhüttenstadt, following the announcement of the planned expansion of Germany’s hydrogen infrastructure.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-plans-major-investment-in-german-sites-to-accelerate-co2-emissions-reduction-strategy-and-leverage-the-hydrogen-grid\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The Hon’ble Prime Minister last Friday had requested suggestions for tackling the current COVID situation and since AM\/NS India produces oxygen gas in the Hazira facility we decided to build this hospital near the facility to help those in need. This will overcome the bottleneck in oxygen supply.”  ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel is primarily producing gaseous oxygen for steel production. However, it has ramped up the production of liquid oxygen substantially to 210 M\/T per day for medical use. As the Covid pandemic is becoming severe in the region, we are utilising the gaseous oxygen for medical purpose which otherwise cannot be transported.  Elaborating on the Covid Hospital, Dilip Oommen, CEO, AM\/NS India said, “We, at AM\/NS India, realise the need to support the authorities in the fight against the global pandemic. As part of our continued endeavour to serve the community, we have introduced the concept of bringing hospital to the vicinity of the oxygen plant, instead of transporting oxygen to hospital. Considering the speed at which the pandemic is spreading, we have also factored in the ramping up of the number of beds. We thank the Government of Gujarat for its cooperation and I reinforce all possible support from AM\/NS India in the fight against Covid-19.”   AM\/NS India is committed to standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the government, authorities, and medical personnel who are working relentlessly to safeguard people.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","title":"AM\/NS India sets up a 1000-bed COVID hospital with uninterrupted oxygen supply in Hazira","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"As the second wave of the Covid-19 virus swells, to supplement the government`s efforts, ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM\/NS India) – a joint venture between ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel – in alliance with the Government of Gujarat and District Administration, Surat, has set up a 250-bed COVID care hospital at Hazira, which will receive an uninterrupted supply of oxygen gas from its plant.

{"id":6556,"text":"The successful transaction reflects ArcelorMittal’s target of reducing its carbon intensity, and its belief that steel is the material of choice for the transition towards a low-carbon, circular economy.  Under the amended RCF – the largest ESG linked facility of its kind in the metals and mining sector - the margin payable will be increased or decreased depending on ArcelorMittal’s performance against certain metrics related to its environmental and sustainability performance. The metrics measured include the CO2 intensity of ArcelorMittal’s European operations and the number of ArcelorMittal facilities globally which have been certified by ResponsibleSteel™ by the end of each year.  ArcelorMittal has set a group-wide target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and a 30 per cent CO2 reduction target for its European operations by 2030. The Company has identified two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology routes, Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI. Its two flagship Smart Carbon initiatives, Carbalyst® (a carbon capture and reuse project) and Torero (converts waste wood into bio-coal which is used as a replacement for coal in the blast furnace) will both come on stream at the Company’s plant in Ghent, Belgium, next year, while in Hamburg, Germany it is developing an industrial-scale project to use hydrogen instead of natural gas in the direct reduction of iron ore.  The Company is a founding member of ResponsibleSteel™, the steel industry’s only global multi-stakeholder certification initiative. Its certification covers over 200 requirements addressing a range of environmental, social and governance standards. Several of the Company’s European Flat Products sites are currently undertaking the ResponsibleSteel™ site-level certification process.  In addition, it has been agreed that the leverage ratio financial covenant currently contained in the RCF will fall away in the event that ArcelorMittal obtains an investment grade long-term credit rating (with a stable outlook) from two rating agencies.  The RCF was signed on 18 December 2018 and remains undrawn and available for the Group’s general corporate purposes.

{"id":6558,"text":"The review, which can be accessed here, underpins the Company’s commitment to transparent reporting. It has been produced in-line with the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework, the Global Reporting Index Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016, the United Nations Global Compact, the European Union’s Directive 2014\/95\/EU on non-financial reporting and the Sustainability Accounting Standards.  The review provides an overview of the Company’s performance in 2020, outlines the progress it made against its strategic priorities and details its short- and long-term plans. Specifically, the review outlines ArcelorMittal’s performance and ambitions across the following areas: health and safety; delivering financial value; innovating smarter steels and solutions; and driving environmental and social sustainability. It also demonstrates the Company’s approach to ensuring it brings long-term, sustainable value to its broad stakeholder base.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “2020 was, by any measure, an extraordinary year. The Covid-19 global pandemic caused unprecedented disruption to societies, businesses and individuals across the globe, forcing us all to re-think the way we live and work. Our clear priority throughout the pandemic was to keep our employees safe and well. We are proud of the care they showed each other and their commitment to keeping the business running.  “Yet for all the challenges of 2020, it was also a year of progress for ArcelorMittal. We achieved our net debt target and improved the quality and earnings capability of our asset portfolio. The upshot is a higher growth portfolio as we are able to focus investment behind higher growth opportunities in markets like Brazil, Mexico, India and Liberia.  “I have therefore stepped into the CEO role at a time when the company is in many ways stronger, allowing me to focus on the four strategic pillars which underpin our vision to remain the world’s leading steel company in the coming decades. The first three – having a strong balance sheet, growth portfolio and competitive cost position – put the Company in a strong position to grow and develop.  “The fourth pillar of our strategy is our ambition to be a sector leader in sustainability. Global concern for sustainability and responsible business continued to grow in 2020, perhaps even accentuated by the challenge of the pandemic. We track performance according to five sustainable development themes but three issues in particular stand out – safety, decarbonisation and diversity. Despite considerable effort, we know our safety performance is not good enough. The Executive Office, the sustainability committee and the full board has discussed this in depth as a result of which changes have been introduced which we hope will support a step change in our safety performance.  “Although the transition to a low carbon society is a significant challenge, it also presents ArcelorMittal with tremendous opportunity. A significant milestone in our decarbonisation ambitions was the launch in March of XCarb™, a brand that brings together all of ArcelorMittal’s reduced, low- and zero-carbon steelmaking activities into a single effort, focused on achieving demonstrable progress towards carbon-neutral steel.   “It is widely recognised that diverse teams bring many benefits to organisations, including an increased wealth of perspectives and the capacity to make better-informed decisions. While our workforce is internationally diverse, our key issue has been gender diversity. We have worked on the plans to address it and are targeting doubling the number of female managers – or higher – by 2030.   “I hope we will be able to report progress on our key metrics in 2021. When it comes to sustainability, steel is an ideal material in the circular economy since it is easily recoverable and infinitely recyclable. I remain very confident in the future of steel, and in the ability of ArcelorMittal to succeed in this environment and continue to invent the smarter steels we need for a better world.”   Lakshmi Mittal, Executive Chairman, ArcelorMittal, added:  “Our vision is to remain the world’s leading steel company for many decades to come. We are aware that our ability to do so will be shaped not only by our financial performance but also our social and environmental performance, and particularly our ability to decarbonise. I have seen many fascinating and transformational developments in my decades in business. None, I believe, have quite the same implications as the challenge to decarbonise the global economy.  “It is a mammoth task for everyone and particularly for those of us operating in the so-called ‘hard to abate sectors’ which includes steel. We are acutely aware of the carbon footprint associated with steelmaking. Nevertheless, we remain confident that steel can and will remain the material of choice for building the world’s infrastructure. While we in no way underestimate the challenge of the transition, we are energised by the opportunities it will provide. Much of the infrastructure required for the transition to a low-carbon economy for example, including renewable energy systems and electric vehicles, depend on steel.  “The potential of the opportunity is what keeps us focused and energised. Our teams of engineers are working hard to ensure ArcelorMittal plays a leading role in the decarbonisation of our industry. Our financial strength, our innovative nature and the ingenuity and capability of our people to find solutions to the toughest challenges stands us in good stead to fulfil our purpose of inventing smarter steels for a better world.”  Key highlights discussed in the review include:    * Actions taken to protect the safety and wellbeing of our employees and support local communities during the pandemic. These included accessing essential medical supplies and personal protective equipment, using our global networks to facilitate the transfer of equipment to regions which are most in need, and financial donations to healthcare facilities, including laboratories to carry out Covid tests.   * The steps the Company is taking to improve its health and safety performance. Initiatives include enhanced governance, the re-vamping of the Company’s global Health and Safety Council and efforts aimed at instilling an interdependent safety culture group-wide.   * The Company’s strategy to address its carbon challenge and become a sector leader in sustainability, including the launch of XCarb™ in March and updates on the various decarbonisation projects being developed and deployed. In line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, in 2020 the Company announced a group-wide commitment to being carbon-neutral by 2050, and will shortly be announcing a group-wide CO2 emissions target for 2030.   * Progress the Company has made in reducing the carbon intensity of the steel it produces; CO2 per tonne of steel was 2.08 tonnes in 2020, a 1.4% improvement over 2019 and a 7.9% improvement since 2007, meeting the Company’s 2020 target.   * Insight into how the Company is managing its broader environmental impact, including detail on the $248 million allocated to 20 projects with energy and\/or carbon benefits, and the $396 million allocated to 32 projects which will deliver a broad range of environmental benefits.   * Progress towards meeting steel and mining certification and accreditation standards; following Covid-19 related delays, the Company has re-started the process of certifying its European flat products sites against ResponsibleSteel™ certification standards and committed to achieving Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) accreditation for its mines in Brazil, Canada, Liberia and Mexico by 2025.   * The importance the Company places on R&D, as evidenced by its $245 million R&D investment in 2020, which supported the launch of 29 new products and solutions to accelerate sustainable lifestyles and 27 to support sustainable construction, infrastructure and energy generation.   * Our plans to continue to improve on diversity and inclusion, including our target to double the representation of women in management positions to 25% by 2030.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes 2020 integrated annual review","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) has today published its 2020 integrated annual review, ‘Inventing smarter steels for a better world’.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-publishes-2020-integrated-annual-review\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6559,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces the completion of its first XCarb™ innovation fund investment since launching the initiative in March 2021. The Company has invested an initial $10 million in Heliogen, a renewable energy technology company which focuses on ‘unlocking the power of sunlight to replace fossil fuels’.  Heliogen’s technology will harness solar energy by using a field of mirrors which will act as a multi-acre magnifying glass to concentrate and capture sunlight. The sunlight will then be subsequently converted into heat (HelioHeat™), electricity (HelioPower™) or clean fuels (HelioFuel™).  All three Heliogen products have the potential to be applicable to the steelmaking process and support the steel industry’s transition to carbon-neutrality. HelioHeat™, for example, could be used to increase the temperature of air blown into a blast furnace, offsetting the use of fossil fuel. The Heliogen technology will also be capable of creating 100 per cent green hydrogen, which Heliogen is working to develop as its first HelioFuel™. Hydrogen sits at the heart of ArcelorMittal’s Innovative-DRI technology pathway, which involves using hydrogen instead of natural gas as the reductant in the production of direct reduced iron.  In addition to the $10 million investment, ArcelorMittal and Heliogen have signed a Memorandum of Understanding which aims to evaluate the potential of Heliogen’s products in several of ArcelorMittal’s steel plants.  Commenting, Pinakin Chaubal, Chief Technology Officer, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Developing and deploying breakthrough technologies is at the heart of our climate action strategy. While our own efforts are progressing well, the objective of our XCarb™ Innovation fund is to extend our reach and support companies developing technologies which could assist us on our decarbonisation journey. The technology Heliogen is developing has the potential to do exactly that.  “Moreover, the partnership we have established with Heliogen goes beyond investment. The MoU we have signed means we are actively exploring working with them to deploy their technologies in our steel plants, enhancing our ongoing programme of decarbonisation initiatives. Establishing partnerships of this kind has an important role to play in ensuring we succeed in our ambition to lead our industry’s efforts to decarbonise, and reach carbon-neutrality by 2050.”  Bill Gross, CEO and Founder, Heliogen, added:  “The future of our planet and civilization hinges on the global economy’s ability to shift from its reliance on fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. We founded Heliogen to eliminate the need for fossil fuels in all sectors of the economy and to empower a sustainable future. We’re thrilled to welcome ArcelorMittal as an investor in the company.”  “We’re also excited to begin working with ArcelorMittal to explore how our technology can support its significant decarbonization efforts. Heliogen’s Sunlight Refinery™, which will cost-effectively deliver 24\/7 carbon-free energy in the form of heat, electricity, or hydrogen fuels at scale for the first time in history, was designed for use by a spectrum of industries, including steel. Together, ArcelorMittal and Heliogen can meaningfully help the world achieve carbon neutrality.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal makes first investment through its XCarb™ innovation fund ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Initial $10 million investment part of broader partnership established with Heliogen","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-makes-first-investment-through-its-xcarb-innovation-fund\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6570,"text":"ArcelorMittal today announces that its Sestao plant in Spain will become the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant.  The development is the result of a memorandum of understanding signed today with the Government of Spain that will see an investment of €1 billion in the construction of a green hydrogen direct reduced iron (DRI) plant at its plant in Gijón, as well as a new hybrid electric arc furnace (EAF).  By 2025, the Sestao plant – which manufactures a range of flat steel products for the automotive and construction sectors, and general industry - will produce 1.6 million tonnes of zero carbon-emissions steel by:    1. Changing the metallic input by increasing the proportion of circular, recycled scrap, and using green hydrogen-produced DRI from Gijón in its two existing EAFs.   2. Powering all steelmaking assets (EAFs, rolling mill, finishing lines) with renewable electricity.   3. Introducing several key emerging technologies that will replace the small, remaining use of fossil fuel in the steelmaking process with carbon-neutral energy inputs, such as sustainable biomass or green hydrogen.    Central to this development will be the construction of a 2.3 million-tonne green hydrogen DRI unit in Gijón. Around 1 million tonnes of DRI will be transported to Sestao to be used a feedstock for its two EAFs.  The national and the Basque government’s support in this project is crucial, firstly from a funding perspective, given the significant cost associated with the transition to carbon-neutral steelmaking. Secondly, because it will enable ArcelorMittal to have access to green hydrogen supplied through a consortium of companies that will cooperate in the construction of the infrastructure required in order to produce hydrogen in the Iberian Peninsula using solar‑powered electrolysis and to transport it directly through a network of pipelines. The initiative involves the construction of multiple large-scale solar farms, with hydrogen produced in situ and with the corresponding impact in terms of employment.  In addition to the investments in the DRI and EAF installations in Gijón, ArcelorMittal will invest €50 million in Sestao. This will fund the introduction of key emerging technologies required to bring the plant to zero carbon-emissions, supporting 1.6 million tonnes of production.  Looking further ahead, the company has also committed to achieving net zero[2] at the Sestao plant as soon as possible.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:  “It is widely understood that for the world to achieve net-zero by 2050, faster progress over the next decade is essential. Having announced a net-zero target for 2050, we therefore set ourselves the challenge to identify how we could take an existing steel plant to zero carbon-emissions within the next five years. Our teams have been working incredibly hard to turn this ambition into the plan that we have announced today. This is a hugely significant development and demonstrates the strength of innovation embedded in our people, our unparalleled technology leadership, and what can be achieved through investment in existing steelmaking infrastructure. It means ArcelorMittal will be the first company in the world to be in a position to offer its customers meaningful volumes of zero carbon-emissions steel.  “The ability of the Sestao plant to become the world’s first zero carbon-emissions steel plant would not be possible without the support and partnership of the Spanish government.

{"id":6571,"text":"ArcelorMittal has today signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Spanish Government that will see a €1 billion investment in decarbonisation technologies at ArcelorMittal Asturias’ plant in Gijón. The investments will reduce CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal’s Spanish operations by up to 4.8 million tonnes, which represents approximately 50% of emissions, within the next five years[2].  The MoU states the commitment of ArcelorMittal and the Government of Spain to transition towards a decarbonised steel industry. ArcelorMittal will introduce new manufacturing processes that contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions. It will also further intensify its R&D capabilities in Spain to support the new project and innovation requirements. The Government of Spain will promote reforms and investments to support the development and growth of a strong, more competitive and sustainable industrial sector, as well as endeavouring to provide maximum financial support for the project, in line with Spanish legislation and European Union regulations.  Given the significant cost associated with the transition, in terms of both capex and opex, it is ArcelorMittal’s expectation this support will cover at least half of the additional cost to enable its operations to remain competitive as it accelerates its decarbonisation program.  The MoU was signed at an event in ArcelorMittal Asturias’ plant in Gijón, which was attended by ArcelorMittal Executive Chairman, Lakshmi Mittal, CEO Aditya Mittal and the President of Spain, Pedro Sánchez as well as Raül Blanco, the Secretary General for Industry, and Adrián Barbón, President of the Asturias regional government.  At the heart of the plan is a 2.3 million-tonne green hydrogen direct reduced iron (DRI) unit, complemented by a 1.1 million-tonne hybrid electric arc furnace (EAF). This starts the transition of the Gijón plant away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the DRI-EAF production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint. The new DRI - which will be the first of its kind in Spain - and EAF will be in production before the end of 2025.   To maximize the emissions reduction potential, ultimately green hydrogen will be used to reduce the iron ore in the DRI, with the EAF powered by renewable electricity. The support of the national and regional governments in this project is crucial as it will enable ArcelorMittal to have access to green hydrogen supplied through a consortium of companies that will cooperate in the construction of the infrastructure required in order to produce hydrogen in the Iberian Peninsula using solar‑powered electrolysis and to transport it directly through a network of pipelines. The initiative involves the construction of multiple large-scale solar farms, with hydrogen produced in situ and with the corresponding impact in terms of employment.  The Gijón DRI will also feed the company’s Sestao plant, situated approximately 250km from Gijón, where production is already entirely from the electric arc furnace route. This means that by 2025 ArcelorMittal Sestao will produce 1.6 million tonnes of steel and be the world’s first full-scale steel plant to achieve zero carbon-emissions.   Speaking at the signing of the MoU in Gijón, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:   “It is widely understood that for the world to achieve net-zero by 2050, faster progress over the next decade is essential. The MoU we have signed today will play an important role in doing exactly that. The construction of the new green hydrogen DRI plant in Gijón will not only enable us to reduce emissions from our Spanish operations by half but will also result in the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant in Sestao.  “Clearly, this is a project that will require the support of many different partners to succeed; our plan hinges on the supply of affordable, mass-scale hydrogen, access to sustainable finance and a supportive legal framework that allows us to be competitive globally. The Spanish government has clearly defined plans to transition the country to a decarbonised economy and I have been impressed by the progress made in creating the energy infrastructure that this green economy will require.  “As a large emitter, the steel industry can make a vital contribution to achieving net zero by 2050. This project demonstrates what is achievable.”  Expressing their support for the plan, Spain’s Minister of Industry María Reyes Maroto said:   “The Government of Spain and the ArcelorMittal Group fully agree that the transition towards a decarbonised economy is an essential objective for Spain, and they both recognise the industrial, technological and regulatory challenges that this transition poses for Spanish industry, as well as the opportunities it offers, in terms of innovation and improved competitiveness. The Government of Spain, through the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, will strongly support a new framework of institutional relations between the Government and the ArcelorMittal Group, because the Government of Spain recognises the importance of the steel industry for the development of the Spanish economy, while also recognising that the industry needs a stable and predictable legal framework as the best tool to enable it to be competitive and attain the targets set in terms of energy transition and digitalisation, both at national and at European Union level. In this regard, the Government of Spain is exploring regulatory instruments to support the industry in the transition process, such as the compensation programmes for electricity-intensive industries, tools to promote improved energy efficiency, public financing for digitalisation, instruments to promote industrial investments, training programmes and strategies to promote the use of clean fuels.”  ArcelorMittal Europe has a target to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, and an ambition to be net-zero by 2050. The company is pursuing two pathways to achieve this: Innovative DRI and Smart Carbon.  ArcelorMittal Spain’s operations are already contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions from the company’s steelmaking operations. Earlier this year, ArcelorMittal Asturias completed its project to capture hydrogen-rich coke oven gas and re-inject it into the blast furnace, replacing some of the coke used in the blast furnace. Deploying this innovative technology will result in a reduction in CO2 emissions of 125,000 tonnes a year, equivalent to the emissions generated by the annual consumption of 84,000 Spanish households with individual natural gas-based heating systems. These CO2 savings have already generated XCarb™ green steel certificates, which were launched by the company in March 2021, allowing ArcelorMittal customers to report a reduction in their Scope 3 CO2 emissions.  [1] On a Scope 1 and 2 basis.  [2] Should green hydrogen not be available at affordable rates by the end of 2025, natural gas would be used to power the DRI furnace. This would still result in a very significant reduction in CO2 emissions, of 4 million tonnes, approximately 45%.

{"id":6573,"text":"In the project CO2, which would otherwise have been emitted, will be separated and recovered from carbon-rich waste gas from the steelmaking process. An innovative chemical process, developed by SEKISUI CHEMICAL in Japan, then converts the waste CO2 into carbon monoxide rich Synthesis Gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen). The Synthesis Gas is then returned to the steelmaking process as an alternative reduction agent for iron ore, thereby lowering the volume of fossil resources required in the steelmaking process.  Key to this work is SEKISUI CHEMICAL’s innovative technology that converts CO2 to carbon monoxide at high yield. To date, producing carbon monoxide in large volumes from CO2 has been very challenging. SEKISUI CHEMICAL aims to demonstrate the ability to scale up its new technology through this partnership with ArcelorMittal.  The technology will initially be trialled over a three-year period at one of ArcelorMittal’s research and development laboratories located in Asturias, Spain, commencing in the third quarter of 2021. The investment cost of the project is USD1.9 million.  Pinakin Chaubal, Chief Technology Officer at ArcelorMittal, said:  “This is an exciting albeit early stage technology which complements our existing carbon capture and re-use or storage technology (CCUS) initiatives. Successfully decarbonising steelmaking will involve multiple technologies and we expect CCUS technologies to have an important role to play. This view is shared by the International Energy Agency which said in its recent ‘Net Zero by 2050’ report that CCUS technologies will be attached to over 50% of steel production by 2050.”  Katsunori Mukai, Director of Corporate R&D at SEKISUI CHEMICAL said:  “SEKISUI CHEMICAL has been developing basic technologies for sustainable societies. One of them is focussed on giving ‘LIFE to CO2’ by enabling carbon recycling in manufacturing industries. In this inter-industry partnership with ArcelorMittal, we are aiming to help reduce the carbon emissions of the steel industry.”  ArcelorMittal has a target of reducing CO2 emissions in Europe by 30 per cent by 2030 and producing carbon-neutral steel group-wide by 2050. To this end, ArcelorMittal is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology pathways, Smart Carbon and Innovative-DRI. Within its Smart Carbon pathway, ArcelorMittal is already developing and deploying other carbon capture and re-use technologies including Carbalyst, a €165 million project in Ghent, Belgium, which converts carbon-rich steelmaking waste gases into bio-ethanol, and IGAR, an industrial-scale pilot project in Dunkirk, France, to capture waste CO2 and waste hydrogen from the steelmaking process and convert it into synthetic gas to replace the use of fossil fuel in steelmaking.

{"id":6574,"text":"The company’s steelmaking sites in ArcelorMittal Belgium (Geel, Genk, Gent and Liège), Luxembourg (Belval, Differdange and Rodange) and Germany (Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt) are the first steel plants globally to be independently audited and found to meet the standards required for ResponsibleSteel, the industry’s first global multi-stakeholder standard and certification initiative.  The ResponsibleSteel audit process enables each site to prove that its production processes meet rigorously defined standards across a broad range of social, environmental and governance criteria including:     * Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions   * Water stewardship and biodiversity   * Human rights and labour rights   * Community relations and business integrity    The standard is based on 12 principles with a variety of criteria and underlying requirements. To be awarded with ResponsibleSteel certification, each site has to undergo a detailed third-party audit, with an independent Certification Committee making the final certification decision. ArcelorMittal worked with international auditor AFNOR and its German subsidiary GUTcert, both specialist companies providing certification and assessment services.  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe said:   “Responsible production techniques and high ethical and business standards have become increasingly important to our customers and consumers. ResponsibleSteel certification gives our customers the reassurance that we meet expectations on setting carbon reduction targets, as well as meeting expectations on environmental and social standards at every stage of production. The certification process has involved many teams across ArcelorMittal, and I would like to congratulate them for their hard work in being the first sites to achieve ResponsibleSteel™ certification – this is a major achievement.”  Explaining what the business has learned from the ResponsibleSteel certification process, Mr Van Poelvoorde said:  “In particular, the ResponsibleSteel process has helped us to improve our social management approach towards our rights holders, including our local communities, our employees, and the contractors working in our sites. While social sustainability has always been an important topic for us, ResponsibleSteel has taught us to take a more management systems-based approach to areas such as human rights, diversity and labour rights. As a result, our aim is to now manage social topics with the same systematic rigour with which quality, environment and safety topics are handled.”  He added: “Given the considerable investments we have already made to achieve a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 2050, as well as our broader environmental investments across our sites, I’m confident that we will achieve our goal of securing certification in each of our Flat Products sites early in 2022.”   ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products is also targeting ResponsibleSteel certification, at more of its sites during 2022.  Speaking at an event at ArcelorMittal Gent to mark the first certifications at ArcelorMittal sites, Anne-Claire Howard, ResponsibleSteel CEO said:   “I am delighted that the first steel sites which have been assessed against the very stringent set of criteria required in the ResponsibleSteel Standard have been approved. The ResponsibleSteel Standard was created by the steel sector’s only truly global multi-stakeholder initiative – designed to ensure business and consumers can be confident that the steel they use has been sourced and produced responsibly at every stage.“  She added: “I would like to congratulate the teams at ArcelorMittal who have supported the development and now the implementation of the ResponsibleSteel Standard at these first sites in Europe. This is truly a ground-breaking moment for both ResponsibleSteel and the steel sector. I am excited to work with the growing number of ResponsibleSteel members and am confident that the pipeline of steel sites who are working to achieve certification will continue to grow over the coming months. This will send a clear and strong message to markets, finance and governments that the steel industry’s intent to not only decarbonise steel production but also to ensure responsible ESG practices in steelmaking has very much begun.”  After the initial phase in Europe, further ArcelorMittal sites around the world will be part of the programme.  In 2021, ResponsibleSteel will launch a standard for the certification of steel products, which will include stringent requirements for raw materials supply chain. ArcelorMittal will continue to play an active role in developing this aspect of the programme.   Steel is the world’s most widely used material and those who use it in the transport, automotive, infrastructure, packaging, construction, energy and white goods sectors have a growing expectation that the materials they work with are responsibly sourced and produced. ResponsibleSteel, which is the world’s first’s responsible sourcing certification scheme for steel, aims to meet these expectations.  ### Discover more  The world’s first ResponsibleSteel-certified steel sites – a case study from ArcelorMittal Belgium  To read the public summaries of the audit reports for each site, please visit https:\/\/www.responsiblesteel.org\/certification\/issued-certificates\/","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal celebrates industry-first with ResponsibleSteel™ site certifications","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announces that it has achieved ResponsibleSteel™ site certification in Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-celebrates-industry-first-with-responsiblesteel-site-certifications\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6577,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) has today published its second group climate action report, following the first group report published in May 2019 and the European climate action report published in May 2020.  In the new report, ArcelorMittal has for the first time announced a 2030 global carbon emissions intensity reduction target of 25%. It has also increased its European 2030 carbon emissions intensity reduction target to 35% from 30% previously announced. All targets are on a scope 1 and 2 basis. The Company had previously announced a net zero by 2050 ambition in September 2020.  The Company’s targets are underpinned by a set of assumptions:    * The cost of green hydrogen will become increasingly competitive over the next decade but will still require government support.   * Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) infrastructure will take time to be built at scale. While Europe is expected to take the lead, CCUS infrastructure has the potential to expand quickly in the US and Canada – providing some potential upside to our assumptions.   * Different regions of the world will continue to move at very different paces and the level of climate ambition will differ between jurisdictions at any given time.   * The introduction of climate-friendly policies in other regions will be 5–10 years behind Europe.    Reflecting these assumptions, each region in which the Company operates is designated as either ‘Accelerate’ (supported by the introduction of more ambitious climate change policy) or ‘Move’ (reflecting a policy environment not yet providing any meaningful support to accelerate steel industry decarbonization and where accelerating without supportive policy will render the asset uncompetitive versus national\/regional competition).  2030 target breakdown and capex  The new climate action report provides a roadmap that illustrates the Company’s current thinking on the journey to net zero steelmaking. Five key levers are identified as the stepping-stones to achieve net zero by 2050. These are:  A – Steelmaking transformation: In the course of the coming decades the steel industry will undergo a transformation of the assets used to make steel on a scale not seen for over 100 years. This includes in a first phase the transition from coal (in the blast furnace) to natural gas (in a DRI plant) as a precursor to green hydrogen DRI.  B – Energy transformation: The energy used to make steel in future years will undergo a further and more radical transition, from high-emitting fossil fuel-based energy to low and zero-carbon emissions forms of energy. This includes green hydrogen, circular forms of carbon and CCUS technologies.  C – Increased use of scrap: As well as using scrap in the EAF, we will increase the use of scrap in blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) steelmaking.  D – Sourcing clean electricity: We will focus on increasing the amount of low and zero-carbon emissions electricity we consume. We plan to do this by purchasing renewable energy certificates and by direct power purchase agreements (PPA) with suppliers from renewable projects.  E – Offsetting residual emissions: There are likely to remain residual emissions for which either there is no feasible technological solution or the solution involves excessively high economic or social costs. For these emissions ArcelorMittal will buy high-quality offsets or launch projects to generate high-quality carbon credits.   Further specific detail for the 2030 target is provided aligning with these five levers, as follows:  1-  |   Announced projects Innovative DRI-EAF  |   -7.5%  |   A, C      ---|---|---|---      2-  |   Announced projects Smart Carbon and gas injection  |   -1.6%   |   B      3-  |   Further projects in development in Europe   |   -5.1%   |   A, B, C      4-  |   Project in NAFTA to be announced  |   -1.5%   |   A, B, C      4-  |   Further projects in development ex-Europe  |   -7.4%   |   A, B, C      5-  |   Sourcing clean electricity  |   -2.1%  |   D      To achieve this reduction the Company has estimated it will require a gross investment of c. $10 billion of capital expenditure. The Company expects to deploy approximately 35% of this c. $10 billion investment by 2025 with the remainder in the second part of this decade.  Over time, and with the deployment of appropriate technologies, it is expected that low-carbon steel-making technologies will become more competitive than higher-carbon steel-making technologies. However, this is not the case today and therefore companies will need support through well-designed policy to help moderate the initial capital costs, which will not yield a reasonable EBITDA return in the short-to-medium term, as well as the higher opex costs in the transition period that could otherwise render them uncompetitive. ArcelorMittal believes support of approximately 50% of total costs will be needed to enable companies to remain competitive regionally and globally through the transition period.   In terms of our investment decision-making, each major capex project proposal is required to demonstrate its CO2 impact to our Investment Allocation Committee (IAC). The IAC considers both the potential future carbon cost as well as the capital cost of decarbonization, to maximize our chances of achieving our targets while ensuring each project is economically justifiable and earns its cost of capital.  The announced Innovative DRI-EAF projects include:    * Reducing emissions in Spain by 50% by constructing a 2.3 million tonne hydrogen-powered DRI unit at Gijon, as well as a new hybrid EAF. The construction of these units will transition the Gijon plant away from BF-BOF steelmaking to DRI-EAF production.   * Transforming ArcelorMittal Sestao to be the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant by 2025. 1 million tonnes of DRI will be transported by rail from Gijon to Sestao to be used as feedstock for its two EAFs. Sestao will also change its metallic input; power all steelmaking assets with renewable electricity; introduce new emerging technologies that will replace the remaining use of fossil fuels in the steelmaking process with carbon-neutral energy inputs.   * Plans to build a large-scale industrial plant for DRI and EAF-based steelmaking in Bremen, as well as an innovative DRI plant and EAF in Eisenhuttenstadt. CO2 savings of up to more than 5 million tonnes could be possible depending on the availability of green hydrogen.   * The construction of a DRI plant in Dunkirk to produce 2 million tonnes per year of hot metal, reducing CO2 emissions by 2.85 million tonnes by 2030.   * Testing of hydrogen injection at our DRI facility in Quebec. The test will start with a limited injection of 5% within the energy mix and further phases are planned in the future. Renewable sources – specifically hydroelectric – provide 99% of Quebec’s energy.    The announced Smart Carbon projects include:    * Torero and Carbalyst – two technologies to enable the use of circular carbon, which does not add carbon to the biosphere. Torero is a torrefaction process to make steel-specific bioenergy from waste wood and waste plastic. Carbalyst allows us to use steelmaking waste gases to produce basic chemicals such as bio-ethanol, which are the key building blocks of plastics.   * In Gent, we are constructing an industrial-scale demonstration plant that converts waste wood into bio-coal through torrefaction. Two reactors will each produce 40,000 tonnes of bio-coal annually that can be used in the blast furnace as a substitute for coal. Reactor 1 is expected to start production in 2022 and reactor 2 in 2024.   * In Gent we are also constructing an industrial scale Steelanol demonstration plant to capture carbon off-gases from the blast furnace and convert them into bioethanol using microbes. The plant is expected to be completed in 2022 and will produce 80 million litres of bioethanol annually.    ArcelorMittal continues to believe that both technology pathways (Innovative DRI and Smart Carbon) have an important role to play in helping the steel industry, and the global economy, achieve net zero by 2050. Furthermore, the Company continues to develop a third route, direct electrolysis, which is still in the research and development phase. Which specific routes will ultimately be adopted is likely to differ from region to region and depend on policy choices and the availability of government funding. The Company has been able to accelerate plans for the world’s first zero carbon-emission steel plant in Spain for example because of government policy to accelerate the availability of green hydrogen.  Policy   The Company has also outlined in the report the combination of policy instruments it believes will be required to address not just the significant capital expenditure to transition to the new zero carbon-emissions technologies, but also the considerably higher operating costs associated with these technologies at least in the short-medium term until low and zero carbon-emission technologies become competitive. Policy instruments such as contracts for difference, used so effectively in enabling the renewable energy industry to become competitive, will play an important role in ensuring a level playing field during the transition period.  ArcelorMittal intends to actively and directly engage with policymakers and organisations that advocate for the policies and conditions that will enable steel to accelerate and achieve its net-zero transition globally while remaining competitive.  Science based targets  The Company has also announced a new collaboration with the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) and a commitment to publish a science-based target within the next two years. The collaboration will support the SBTi to develop a new science-based methodology for the steel sector.   As part of the Net Zero Steel Pathway Methodology Project (NZSPMP), ArcelorMittal has, with other steelmakers, been working on a set of principles by which it believes the steel industry’s alignment with a net zero by 2050 outcome should be measured. These principles were published on 27 July.   Just transition  ArcelorMittal is aware of key stakeholder concerns around a just transition. We are seeking to employ best practice principles to understand the social impact of our decarbonization strategy and support engagement with our key stakeholders and collaborate with policy makers in addressing this issue.  TCFD and Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Benchmark Alignment   The Company has followed the TCFD guidelines and the Climate Action 100 Net Zero benchmark. While we have not yet achieved full disclosure according to either the TCFD or CA100 Net Zero benchmark, we believe this report marks a meaningful step forward, thereby demonstrating to stakeholders our commitment to adopting a leadership position in the decarbonization of the steel industry in terms of target-setting, performance and disclosure.  Executive remuneration  The Company now intends to link these targets to executive remuneration. Details will be published in due course.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal said:  “As the world’s most prolific material, steel can make a huge contribution to the decarbonization of the global economy. Steel is already the material of choice due to its lower carbon footprint and high recyclability. But we can and must go further as zero carbon-emissions steel has the potential to be the backbone of the buildings, infrastructure, industry and machinery, and transport systems that will enable governments, customers and investors to meet their net-zero commitments.  “ArcelorMittal has been working hard to be at the forefront of our sector in the net-zero transition, as we believe not only will this help decarbonize the global economy but will also generate opportunities in multiple aspects of our business.   “This is reflected in the new targets we have announced today. We have for the first time published a group target for 2030, alongside a more ambitious target for our European business. These targets we believe are aligned with our net zero 2050 ambition and we have also announced today a new collaboration with the Science Based Target initiative.  “These targets reflect the uneven pace of change that is the reality of the world’s decarbonization journey. In regions of the world like Europe, where we are observing an ‘Accelerate’ policy scenario, we can be more ambitious – with plans to reduce emissions by 35% within the next decade. In other markets we face a situation where being a first mover will result in us being uncompetitive in that market. For our target setting today we assume progress in other regions of the world will be at least five years behind Europe.   “With COP26 focused on addressing the acceleration that is critical in the next decade if the world is to reach its 2050 target, it may be that we will see a swifter evolution of this policy environment than is currently envisaged. Policymaking has a catalytic role to play. ArcelorMittal intends to step up our advocacy for policies that support the acceleration of this transition, addressing the fact that both capex and opex costs will be significantly higher, at least in the short to medium term.   “Ultimately the goal is to ensure that the technologies that will decarbonize the steel-making process are competitive. The good news is that we already have two technology routes - Innovative DRI and Smart Carbon - which can enable the decarbonization of the industry with a third, direct electrolysis, looking encouraging. Given our global profile we believe it is sensible to continue to develop both these technology routes which essentially encompass the clean energy routes of both green hydrogen and also bio-energy with carbon capture utilization and storage.  “In Europe our strategy is largely focused on the Innovative DRI pathway. This reflects the commitment in Europe to prioritize the availability of green hydrogen at competitive prices. Spain’s plan to accelerate the availability of renewable energy and green hydrogen underpins our recent announcement that ArcelorMittal Sestao will become the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant.   “In many respects the challenges confronting steelmaking today resemble those faced by renewable energy over a decade ago. The importance of solar and wind was widely acknowledged yet the technology remained economically prohibitive. Targeted, reliable and thoughtful policies supported innovation and investment that enabled both companies and their financing partners to make long-term planning decisions.  “We are optimistic that the same will happen in steel. It is too critical a material on so many levels for that not to be the case. And as developing economies continue to grow, the world will need more steel, not less, to give a better quality of life to billions of people.  “Over this past year, we have engaged with our stakeholders on climate more than ever before. I hope this report demonstrates how seriously we take your input, how closely we have listened to your questions, and how committed we are to providing solutions.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes second group climate action report","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"- Targeting 25% global carbon-emissions reduction by 2030  - Estimated cost of c. $10 billion  - Europe 2030 target increased to 35%  - ArcelorMittal Sestao to become world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions plant - New collaboration announced with Science Based Targets initiative - Targets to be linked to executive remuneration","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-publishes-second-group-climate-action-report\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6579,"text":"ArcelorMittal (the ‘Company’) has today announced with the Government of Canada its intention for a CAD$1.765 billion investment in decarbonization technologies at ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton. The intended investments will reduce annual CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal’s Hamilton, Ontario operations by approximately 3 million tonnes, which represents approximately 60% of emissions, within the next seven years. This means the Hamilton plant will transition away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) – Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint.  ArcelorMittal will introduce new manufacturing processes that contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions and deliver other positive environmental impacts including the elimination of emissions and flaring from coke making and ironmaking operations.  The investment is contingent on support from the governments of Canada and Ontario. Today the Government of Canada announced it will invest CAD$400 million in the project. The Company is in discussions with the Government of Ontario regarding its support.  The announcement was made at an event in ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton, which was attended by ArcelorMittal CEO Aditya Mittal, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard, Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne and Minister of Labour Filomena Tassi.  At the heart of the plan is a 2 million tonne capacity DRI facility and an EAF facility capable of producing 2.4 million tonnes of high-quality steel through its existing secondary metallurgy and secondary casting facilities. Modification of the existing EAF facility and continuous casters will also be undertaken to align productivity, quality and energy capabilities between all assets in the new footprint.  The new DRI and EAF will be in production before the end of 2028.  This project contributes to the sustainability of well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing and is also expected to support as many as 2,500 jobs during the engineering and construction phases. It will also support ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s customers decarbonization ambitions while further enhancing ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s capability to support the most demanding product segments including automotive exposed, advanced high strength steels, and consumer packing.  This new production route for ArcelorMittal Dofasco will provide a technically advanced manufacturing environment for operations, maintenance, and technology staff to work in, with improved health and safety. New positions, training, and development will be provided for employees moving from existing business units to new assets, with approximately 160,000 training hours required to transition our workforce to the new footprint.  Expressing Canada’s support for the plan, Deputy and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland said:  “Our government has been steadfast in defending and championing our steel workers. Today’s announcement, through the Net Zero Accelerator, is about investing in the low-carbon transformation of Canadian industry, taking serious action in the global fight against climate change, and supporting good middle-class jobs in Hamilton. We will continue to be there to support growth and a strong economic future for our steel workers and the broader Hamilton community.”  François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, said:  “We are supporting our steel workers and companies like ArcelorMittal Dofasco as they seize today’s opportunities in the low-carbon economy and they do their part in the fight against climate change. This investment will ensure that Canada’s largest producer of flat-rolled steel adopts innovative technologies, continues to provide economic opportunities for Canadian workers, and contributes meaningfully toward our climate targets. This investment will create good jobs in communities like Hamilton and clean Canadian-made products for the world for decades to come.”  Filomena Tassi, Minister of Labour, added:  “This $400 million investment by our government in reducing greenhouse gas emissions at ArcelorMittal Dofasco will transform Hamilton. It will position ArcelorMittal Dofasco to become a world leader in the development of advanced steels and make a significant contribution to achieving Canada’s carbon pollution reduction targets. We are proud to work with organizations like ArcelorMittal Dofasco that are committed to building a stronger, more competitive economy by innovating to fight climate change and creating 2,500 new jobs.”  Speaking at the announcement in Hamilton, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:  “The plans we have announced today represent a historic moment for ArcelorMittal in Canada and North America, marking the beginning of a new era of steelmaking in Hamilton, that will result in a 60% drop in CO2 emissions within the next seven years. We are very pleased to be in partnership with the Government of Canada - as partners, we all recognize that it is vital to accelerate our carbon emissions reduction and strengthen our climate action. Indeed progress in the next decade is vital if the world is to reach net zero by 2050.  “This project is part of ArcelorMittal’s new global 25% CO2 2030 emissions reduction target which was announced yesterday in our second climate action report. DRI-EAF technology, such as that being introduced in Dofasco, is at the heart of our new target although we do also continue to develop our smart carbon technology route. Transitioning from the blast furnace route to the DRI-route, offers an immediate significant reduction in emissions in the first phase through natural gas and then in a second phase, which we call innovative DRI, harnessing green hydrogen or other Smart Carbon technologies.  “This is the first significant decarbonization project we have announced outside Europe and again reflects ArcelorMittal’s determination to lead the decarbonization of the steel industry. Across the company our people are highly motivated to demonstrate that steel can reach net zero and will be the core material for a carbon-neutral world. This project in Dofasco is a very significant and important milestone in this journey.”  Highlighting the transformative impact of the announcement, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard said:  “The Government of Canada’s investment accelerates the realization of low carbon steelmaking in Canada. This significant total investment in Hamilton will transform our organization and deliver exceptional benefits to all our stakeholders including our customers, our employees and the community.  “The new steelmaking footprint will improve our capability to support the most demanding product segments with advanced high strength steels, including those used for the emerging electric vehicles in the automotive sector. The new steelmaking stream also sustains well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing in Ontario, with the opportunity for our highly skilled employees to work in the most technically advanced Steelmaking assets in North America. The company’s bayfront property has been re-imagined and we are well on the way to a significant and broad reduction in environmental impacts, contributing to the health and sustainability of our community, the environment and the economy.”  ArcelorMittal has an ambition to be net zero by 2050. Yesterday the Company published its second group Climate Action Report in which it set a new 2030 global carbon emissions intensity reduction target of 25%. It has also increased its European 2030 carbon emissions intensity target to 35%, from 30%. ArcelorMittal estimates the cost of achieving its global 2030 carbon reduction target is c. US$10 billion and believes government funding support of approximately 50% is required to enable the Company to remain competitive regionally and globally through the transition period given the capital investment required and higher operating costs of low-carbon steelmaking technologies. The Company has developed two technology pathways, Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI, both of which it believes will have an important role to play in helping the Company achieve net zero by 2050.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal and the Government of Canada announce investment of CAD$1.765 billion in decarbonisation technologies in Canada","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"New DRI and EAF installations at ArcelorMittal Dofasco in Hamilton, Ontario will reduce carbon emissions by approximately 60%","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-and-the-government-of-canada-announce-investment-of-cad-1-765-billion-in-decarbonization-technologies-in-canada\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6583,"text":"This demonstrator plant, which will use hydrogen exclusively as the chemical agent to reduce iron ore into DRI, is intended to lay the foundation for a steelmaking process that means steel can be produced with zero carbon-emissions[1], using electric arc furnaces fed with hydrogen reduced DRI and scrap metal, powered by renewable electricity.   The Federal Government has expressed its intention to provide €55 million of funding support towards the construction of the plant, which is half of the €110 million total capital expenditure required. The next step is for the European Commission to approve the Federal Government's intention to provide funding before the installation of the new plant can begin. Production is scheduled to start in 2025.  DRI is currently produced using natural gas to reduce iron ore. In a transition phase, the process of reducing iron ore with hydrogen will first be demonstrated using hydrogen generated by the separation of waste gas from the Hamburg plant. Once available in sufficient volumes and at an affordable price, green hydrogen - made from the electrolysis of water using renewable energy - will be used. By 2030, ArcelorMittal plans to produce more than one million tonnes of zero carbon-emissions steel a year in the Hamburg plant alone, thereby saving around 800,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.  The plant is an important component of ArcelorMittal Germany’s Steel4Future strategy, which involves the conversion of its four German plants - in Hamburg, Bremen, Duisburg and Eisenhüttenstadt - to zero carbon-emissions steel production in the coming years.  Commenting, Dr. Uwe Braun, CEO ArcelorMittal Hamburg, said:  “With the intended plant, for the first time we will be able to produce 100,000 tonnes of DRI for steel production using hydrogen - as early as 2025. Our project thus contributes to the goal of greenhouse gas reduction and a low-carbon economy. The technology is also directly transferrable and shows how other steelworks in our group – like Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt - can convert to zero carbon-emissions steel production processes. But one thing is clear - the production of low or zero carbon-emissions steel is significantly more expensive than traditional steelmaking methods. When it comes to these challenges, we continue to rely on political support to create the appropriate framework conditions. The German Government's intention to provide funding helps our project and we are very grateful for this. Now we need approval from the European Commission so that words can be followed up with action.”  Svenja Schulze, German Federal Environment Minister, said:  “Ever since mankind started producing steel, it has needed coal to do so. We are helping to ensure that this will be possible in the future with hydrogen from wind and solar power. The restructuring of the steel industry is a huge challenge. The German Government will not leave the steel industry alone in the transformation. My ministry is offering concrete support for investment in climate protection through the decarbonisation funding program. For industry, our ambitious climate targets are both a challenge and an opportunity. If companies invest now in greenhouse gas-neutral processes and products such as green steel, they will be able to survive on the market in the future, and jobs will be secure. The prerequisite for all this is the expansion of renewable energies. Anyone who says yes to steel production with a future must also say yes to the spirited expansion of wind and solar energy.”  Jens Kerstan, Senator for the Environment, Climate, Energy and Agriculture in Hamburg, said:  “Those who pursue climate protection invest in the future, invest in the location and secure jobs. By switching to low-CO2 and, in the long term, climate-neutral steel production, ArcelorMittal is seizing the opportunity to become a pioneer of an innovative climate protection technology. The production of green steel is a particular challenge, and as an environmental authority we have closely supported the H2H project from the outset. I am pleased that with this project Hamburg is further expanding its pioneering role in the decarbonisation of industry. We need such innovative strategies to achieve our climate targets.\"  Michael Westhagemann, Senator for Economics and Innovation in Hamburg, said:  “Decarbonising industry, especially the steel industry, is a socio-political task of the century. The aim is to achieve our climate protection targets within the set deadlines without jeopardizing Germany as an industrial and technology location. Thanks to the commitment of the German Environment Ministry, here in Hamburg we are a good step closer to achieving this goal. Our heartfelt thanks therefore goes to the Federal Environment Minister and her office for their far-sighted support.”   Press contact: Arne Langner, [email protected], +49 30 75445-556  [1] On a Scope 1 and 2 basis.

{"id":6584,"text":"With the MDA amendment coming into effect, the ArcelorMittal Liberia will significantly ramp up production of premium iron ore, generating significant new jobs and wider economic benefits for Liberia.  The expansion project - which encompasses processing, rail and port facilities - will be one of the largest mining projects in West Africa. The capital required to finalise the project is expected to be approximately $0.8 billion, as it is effectively a brownfield expansion.  The expansion project includes the construction of a new concentration plant and the substantial expansion of mining operations, with the first concentrate expected in late 2023, ramping up to 15 million tonnes per annum (‘mtpa’). Under the agreement the company will have reservation for expansion for at least up to 30mt. Other users may be allowed to invest for additional rail capacity.  Economic benefits  As the largest foreign investor in Liberia, ArcelorMittal Liberia has invested over $1.7 billion in the country over the past 15 years.  More than 2000 jobs are expected to be created during the construction phase, with Liberians envisaged to fill the majority of the roles created.  ArcelorMittal operates a Vocational Training Centre and provides two-year residential certificate training in mechanical and electrical trades.  As part of the expansion, ArcelorMittal Liberia has also launched a training and development program for high potential Liberian employees who will gain on the job experience and knowledge in ArcelorMittal Mining operations globally.  The employees will receive advanced training in the fields of mining production and operation optimisation, plant maintenance, planning and execution, plant electrical operation systems, and electrical maintenance. Other training areas include plant fitting and heavy-duty mobile equipment maintenance, as well as mine production and operations.  The investment in advanced skills training demonstrates ArcelorMittal Liberia’s commitment to providing employment and professional development opportunities to Liberians.  In addition, it is envisaged that the expansion will further boost the growth of small and medium sized businesses in Liberia which offer a range of services to ArcelorMittal Liberia.  Commenting on the agreement, his Excellency George Manneh Weah, President of the Republic of Liberia, said:  “We are delighted to have reached this important agreement with ArcelorMittal Liberia, our long-term partner in the development of the mining sector in Liberia. This agreement demonstrates to the world that Liberia welcomes foreign direct investment and is a key emerging destination for capital. It further supports the Government’s ’Pro Poor’ agenda, which is underpinned by the importance of creating jobs to lift Liberian citizens out of poverty. The further investment by ArcelorMittal in Liberia bears testament to the company’s confidence in the future of this country. We are confident that our constructive working relationship will go from strength to strength.”  Lakshmi Mittal, Executive Chairman, ArcelorMittal, said:  “The expansion underlines ArcelorMittal’s long-term commitment to Liberia and the importance of a continued productive partnership with the government which helped bring this project to fruition. I would like to thank President Weah and his administration for their invaluable commitment and support which has been critical in enabling us to sign today’s agreement.  “The expansion of mine, processing, rail and port facilities is the largest iron ore project in West Africa and will draw international attention to Liberia as an attractive country to invest in. The current planned expansion is part of a long-term commitment by ArcelorMittal to Liberia that includes undertaking planning for the further expansion of our iron ore asset to at least 30mtpa.”  Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, added:  “This project is an important component of our strategic growth programme, designed to ensure ArcelorMittal captures the best organic growth opportunities within our business. The Phase 2 expansion in Liberia is an excellent example of how we can leverage growth opportunities within our existing asset base to deliver sustainable, long-term value.

{"id":6585,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces it has become an anchor partner in Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst program, committing to an equity investment of $100 million over the next five years.  Founded by Bill Gates, Breakthrough Energy is committed to scaling the technologies the world needs to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Breakthrough Energy’s efforts include investment vehicles, philanthropic programs, policy advocacy, and other initiatives, including Catalyst.  Catalyst, launched earlier this year, is a new model for how companies, governments, and private philanthropy can finance, produce, and ensure widespread adoption of next-generation clean technologies. The program will initially focus on four decarbonisation technologies: direct air capture (DAC); green hydrogen; long-duration energy storage (LDS); and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).  ArcelorMittal’s investment will be made through its XCarb™ innovation fund which was launched earlier this year. The Company anticipates investing up to $100 million annually through the fund in companies developing technologies with the potential to support and accelerate the transition to zero-carbon emissions steelmaking. To date, ArcelorMittal has invested $10 million in Heliogen, a renewable energy company which focuses on unlocking the power of sunlight to replace fossil fuels, and $25 million in Form Energy, which is working on the development of its breakthrough energy storage technology.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal said:  “The Catalyst program is innovative and necessary. It brings together public and private finance with the objective of fast-tracking the deployment of projects which can deliver significant carbon reduction. For ArcelorMittal and the steel industry this kind of initiative is critically important. The steel industry knows how to decarbonise – essentially what is missing is the availability of clean energy at competitive prices that provides the foundation for us to really accelerate. That’s why, after discussing the purpose of Catalyst with Bill, we were very happy to join as an anchor partner. Achieving net zero by 2050 needs a coordinated global drive the likes of which the world has never seen before. ArcelorMittal has its own comprehensive plan to decarbonise – with the first step being to achieve our group target of reducing emissions intensity by 25% by 2030 – but partnerships to scale up and accelerate progress are vital. There are so many interesting new companies and technologies that will help the world decarbonise – through both our XCarb™ fund and now Breakthrough Energy Catalyst we look forward to helping these companies accelerate their contribution.”  Bill Gates, Founder, Breakthrough Energy added:  “Avoiding a climate disaster will require a new industrial revolution. We need to make the technologies and products that don’t cause emissions as cheap as those that do, so the whole world can afford them and reach our climate goals. Through Catalyst, leaders from across the private and public sectors are coming together to focus on supporting technologies that are vital to the world reaching net-zero emissions but are currently too expensive to be adopted at scale. By coordinating investments and directing them toward these critical technologies, we can reduce their Green Premiums and help them get to market faster, so we can all reach our climate goals.”  ArcelorMittal recently published its second group climate action report in which it announced a 2030 global CO2e intensity reduction target of 25% and increased its European 2030 CO2e intensity reduction target to 35%. The Company had previously, in September 2020, announced its ambition to reach net zero by 2050. The report outlined the five key levers – steelmaking transformation, energy transformation, increased use of scrap, sourcing clean electricity and offsetting residual emissions – identified as the stepping stones to achieving net zero by 2050. It also detailed several of the projects the Company is undertaking to reach its 2030 reduction target. These include plans to create the world’s first zero carbon emissions steel plant in Sestao, Spain and convert its Canadian flat steel operations to DRI-EAF steelmaking through a CAD$1.8 billion investment which will reduce CO2 emissions by 60%.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal joins Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst program as anchor partner","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"$100 million equity investment to be made over five years through XCarb™ innovation fund","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-joins-breakthrough-energy-s-catalyst-program-as-anchor-partner\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6588,"text":"ArcelorMittal announces that it has signed a letter of intent with the Governments of Belgium and Flanders, supporting a €1.1 billion project to build a 2.5 million-tonne direct reduced iron (DRI) plant at its site in Gent, as well as two new electric furnaces.  A DRI plant uses natural gas, and potentially hydrogen, instead of coal to reduce iron ore, resulting in a large reduction in CO2 emissions compared with blast furnace ironmaking. The two electric furnaces will melt the DRI and scrap steel, which will then be transformed in the steel shop into steel slabs and then further processed into finished products.  Once the DRI and electric furnaces are built, there will be a transition period during which production will move gradually from blast furnace A, to the DRI and electric furnaces, after which blast furnace A will be closed as it reaches the end of its life. By 2030, this will result in a reduction of around three million tonnes of CO2 emissions each year.  The support of both the national and the Flanders governments in this project is crucial given the significant cost associated with the transition to carbon-neutral steelmaking.  Approval from the European Commission for the funding support will also be required.  Smart Carbon and DRI synergies   The DRI plant will operate alongside Gent’s blast furnace B, which restarted production in March 2021 following a significant investment of €195 million.  Various decarbonisation initiatives, including the commissioning in 2022 of Gent’s Steelanol\/Carbalyst and Torero projects will see annual CO2 emissions reduction of 0.9 million tonnes by 2030.  The combination of the new DRI plant alongside a sustainable, state-of-the-art blast furnace enables the creation of unique synergies in ArcelorMittal Belgium’s roadmap to climate-neutral steelmaking.  Combined, the various initiatives will enable ArcelorMittal Belgium to reduce its CO2 emissions by 3.9 million tonnes per year by 2030 (on a scope 1 and 2 basis, compared with 2018), which is equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 848,172 cars being driven for a year[1]. As a result, ArcelorMittal Belgium will make a significant contribution to ArcelorMittal Europe’s ambition to reduce CO2e emissions intensity by 35% by 2030 and to become carbon neutral by 2050.  Roadmap to 2050  The hybrid model approach of Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI steelmaking in Gent fits into ArcelorMittal Belgium’s CO2 roadmap which consists of three axes:    * Further improvement of material and energy efficiency as well as increased scrap usage   * The implementation of Smart Carbon technologies:     1. Replacing fossil carbon with circular and waste carbon: 'Fresh' raw materials will increasingly be replaced with waste products, in an environmentally and economically feasible way. The Torero project will pre-treat waste wood from container parks to produce bio-coal suitable for the blast furnace process. ArcelorMittal Belgium also has demonstration projects running with plastic waste that could be injected into the blast furnaces in the form of powder or gas.   2. Reforming waste gas into useful chemical compounds: In 2022, ArcelorMittal Belgium will commission a plant (Steelanol\/Carbalyst) to biologically convert gas from the steelmaking process into bioethanol.   3. Separating CO2 for reuse or storage.     * Hydrogen: replacing carbon as a reductant, with hydrogen (ultimately green hydrogen, when it is available commercially).    Alexander De Croo, Prime Minister of Belgium, said:  “To tackle the climate crisis, we need ambitious action. European countries are leading the way, with clear targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. It is good to see that sectors with a large footprint are also joining the race by investing in innovation that reduces emissions and, in the long term, achieves carbon neutrality. This major investment in new technology by ArcelorMittal is important for the wider Ghent region, for reducing our country's footprint, and shows that decarbonising our economy is a joint effort.”  Jan Jambon, Flemish Minister-President, said:  “We believe that technological breakthroughs are key in delivering on the climate agenda. The ambitious roadmap brought forward by ArcelorMittal for its site in Ghent is in that sense an opportunity.”  Vincent Van Peteghem, Deputy Prime Minister of the Belgian Government and Belgian Minister of Finance, said:  “In order for us to enable climate transition for a better, healthier tomorrow it is crucial for government and industry to come together in this crucial pivoting point in time. ArcelorMittal is proving to be a leading example for this transition in our region. This joint effort is not only securing the presence of ArcelorMittal in our region but is also quintessential in lending the Ghent region healthy & clean air for all.”  Hilde Crevits, Deputy Prime Minister of the Flemish Government and Flemish Minister for Economy, Innovation, Work, Social Economy and Agriculture, said:  “ArcelorMittal has chosen a ground-breaking and innovative technology that will significantly reduce emissions from one of their blast furnaces, resulting in a 4% reduction of emissions in Flanders. This unique project will serve as an example to the rest of Europe on how to realise the goal of climate neutrality. Simultaneously, it ensures the sustainable creation of jobs and strengthens ArcelorMittal's competitiveness, to the benefit of Flanders’ welfare and prosperity.”  Tinne Van der Straeten, Belgian Minster of Energy, said:  “This ambitious project shows that industry is a crucial partner to achieve a climate neutral society by 2050. It will be one of the largest climate investments in Belgium that will anchor ArcelorMittal in the Ghent region, that guarantees employment and that will provide low carbon and ultimately carbon neutral steel. Green steels is needed in the switch to 100% renewable energy. What is good for the climate is good for the economy and for everyone.”  Matthias Diependaele, Flemish Minister of Finance and Budget, Housing and Immovable Heritage, said:  “This investment for ArcelorMittal's infrastructure is a sign of responsible Flemish policy. We are investing in a sustainable future for the country, both in terms of emissions and in securing employment in the port of Ghent.”  Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Today’s announcement is the third major decarbonisation project we have announced in the past two months, demonstrating how we are taking firm steps to decarbonise our operations and crucially, to accelerate progress in the decade ahead. None of these projects would be possible without government backing, so we are very grateful to the governments of Belgium and Flanders for their ongoing support as we transition to net-zero steelmaking. Today’s announcement of our project to build a 2.5 million-tonne DRI plant that will co-exist with and complement the Smart Carbon pathway in which we are already investing in Gent, is an example of the kind of transformational change we want and need to implement in order to accelerate ArcelorMittal’s journey to net-zero steelmaking.”  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO, ArcelorMittal Europe, said:   “ArcelorMittal Europe recently announced a more ambitious target for reducing CO2 emissions, from a 30% to a 35% decrease by 2030. We are able to reduce our environmental impact faster, thanks to projects such as this, which embody the cooperation and innovation that we need in order to succeed. ArcelorMittal Belgium has played a vital role in the European business’ decarbonisation strategy from the outset, and as a result of today’s announcement, we will continue to see it at the forefront as we move closer to net-zero steelmaking.”   Manfred Van Vlierberghe, CEO, ArcelorMittal Belgium, said:  “ArcelorMittal Belgium has a passion for sustainability and circularity. We continue to invest and launch new projects in order to remain at the forefront of energy and climate transition. This €1.1 billion project is a major milestone in our decarbonisation journey. The DRI plant and two electric furnaces will result in a sharp decrease of CO2 emissions while the relined blast furnace will contribute to recycling waste wood and end-of-life plastics. This approach contributes to strengthening our global leadership in terms of CO2 and energy efficiency in the steel sector.”  [1] Calculated using the US EPA greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator - https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/energy\/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal signs letter of intent with the governments of Belgium and Flanders, supporting €1.1 billion investment in decarbonisation technologies at its flagship Gent plant","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Belgium will reduce CO2 emissions by 3.9 million tonnes per year by 2030, by building a 2.5 million-tonne direct reduced iron (DRI) plant and two electric furnaces at its Gent site, to operate alongside its state-of-the-art blast furnace that is ready to take waste wood and plastics as a substitute for fossil carbon.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-signs-letter-of-intent-with-the-governments-of-belgium-and-flanders-supporting-1-1-billion-investment-in-decarbonisation-technologies-at-its-flagship-gent-plant\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6591,"text":"The floating solar farm has been installed on a former cooling pond belonging to ArcelorMittal Differdange, and consists of 25,000m2 of solar panels, with a surface area of 5.7 hectares. Eventually, the electricity produced will amount to 3 GWh\/year and will be able to power nearly 800 local homes, i.e. the annual electricity usage of 3,200 people*. The electricity produced on the floating solar farm will be fed into the local grid and contribute to Luxembourg’s energy self-sufficiency.  Genesis of the project   In 2019, as part of a call for projects launched by the Luxembourg government, for the production of electricity from solar energy, ArcelorMittal and Enovos decided to join forces to carry out the first project of its kind in the Grand Duchy. A contract was signed between the two partners, under the terms of which ArcelorMittal would make its Differdange industrial basin available to the energy operator, which owns, manages and operates the photovoltaic structure.  A first in Luxembourg   Following feasibility studies and the obtaining of the necessary administrative permits, construction started in March 2021 and the plant was commissioned on 21 October 2021. This unusual construction project involved around 30 people for more than six months. The floating solar structure and the transformer station were first installed, and then the electrical connection was made. The highlight of this phase of the project was the drilling under the rail network adjacent to the basin, which allowed the cables needed to connect the installation to the public network, to be laid.  Thomas Georges, CEO of ArcelorMittal Differdange, said: \"With this project, which is in line with ArcelorMittal's sustainable development strategy in Luxembourg, and in particular with our commitment to communities and citizens, we have made available the conversion of an industrial basin for sustainable energy production. The combined efforts of ArcelorMittal and Enovos have made it possible to develop an innovative solution for the benefit of Luxembourg households. This project is a first for our sites and serves as an inspiration for future projects, as part of our decarbonisation strategy.  For Enovos and the Encevo Group, the message is clear: \"Enovos is building on its growing expertise to develop and build large-scale green energy plants. We are working hard to develop new concepts that emphasise the value of space and allow for multiple use between biodiversity, industrial activities and energy production from renewable sources. The Differdange floating plant is a clear example of how, by joining forces with industry and the energy supplier, we can advance the energy transition. We are proud to have ArcelorMittal as a partner on our journey to carbon neutrality.  * based on a consumption per 4-person household of 3,668 KWh\/year.  # Click here to watch a film about the project:","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Differdange hosts Luxembourg’s first floating solar farm    ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"HRH Grand Duke Henri and Claude Turmes, Luxembourg’s Minister of Energy, attended today’s ceremony to celebrate Luxembourg’s first floating solar farm, which was officially inaugurated by Thomas Georges, CEO of ArcelorMittal Differdange, accompanied by Claude Seywert, CEO Encevo Group and Erik Von Scholz, CEO Enovos Luxembourg.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-differdange-hosts-luxembourg-s-first-floating-solar-farm\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

The investment further expands ArcelorMittal’s relationship with LanzaTech, which commenced in 2015 when the Company first announced plans to utilise LanzaTech’s carbon capture and re-use technology at its plant in Ghent, Belgium. The €180 million Carbalyst® plant – ArcelorMittal’s flagship carbon capture and re-use technology project - is currently under construction, with commissioning expected before the end of 2022. Also known as the Steelanol project, funding has been obtained from various sources, including from the European Union's Horizon 2020 program, the European Investment Bank and the Belgian and Flemish governments.  Using LanzaTech’s gas fermentation technology, which captures carbon-rich waste gases from the steelmaking process and converts them into sustainable fuels and chemicals, the plant will reduce ArcelorMittal Ghent’s CO2e emissions by 125,000 tonnes a year. It will also produce 80 million litres of bio-ethanol annually, which can be blended with traditional gasoline and used as a low-carbon alternative fuel for the transport sector.  LanzaTech is also developing technology to convert captured emissions into a range of other chemical building blocks to make useful materials, such as textiles, rubber, and packaging.  Commenting, Pinakin Chaubal, chief technology officer, ArcelorMittal said:  “We have worked with LanzaTech for several years, know their leadership team well and understand the potential of their technology and the role it can play in not only helping us to decarbonise, but also in producing valuable products from our carbon bearing gases which can help the decarbonisation of other sectors. Extending our relationship through this investment was therefore a natural next step and we are very pleased to now have an excellent CCU technology company within our XCarb™ innovation fund portfolio.”   Jennifer Holmgren, CEO, LanzaTech added:  “No longer can we simply extract more resources to make the things we need. ArcelorMittal has long been a champion of the circular economy and through their XCarb™ innovation fund they are helping create a new circular carbon economy. We are delighted to deepen our relationship with ArcelorMittal and look forward to this next chapter as we create a future where everything can be made from recycled carbon.”  Previous investments the Company has made through its XCarb™ innovation fund include: US$10 million in Heliogen, a renewable energy technology company that focuses on ‘unlocking the power of sunlight to replace fossil fuels’; US$25 million in Form Energy, which is developing a breakthrough low-cost iron-air battery storage technology; and a commitment of US$100 million over five years in Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst program, an initiative Bill Gates founded to scale the technologies the world needs to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal expands partnership with carbon capture and re-use specialist LanzaTech through US$30 million investment","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Investment is ArcelorMittal’s fourth via its XCarb™ innovation fund","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-expands-partnership-with-carbon-capture-and-re-use-specialist-lanzatech-through-us-30-million-investment\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6657,"text":"Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) said today it added 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved oil and gas reserves in 2015, replacing 67 percent of production, including a 219 percent replacement ratio for crude oil and other liquids.\n  * 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels added to reserves; replacement ratio 67 percent\n  * Liquids replaced at a ratio of 219 percent comprising 59 percent of total proved reserves\n  * Ten-year replacement ratio of 115 percent \nAt year-end 2015, ExxonMobil's proved reserves totaled 24.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels. Liquids represented 59 percent of proved reserves, up from 54 percent in 2014. ExxonMobil’s reserves life at current production rates is 16 years.  \nIn 2015, reserves were added in Abu Dhabi, Canada, Kazakhstan and Angola. Liquid additions during 2015 totaled 1.9 billion barrels. Natural gas proved reserves were reduced by 834 million oil-equivalent barrels primarily in the United States reflecting the change in natural gas prices. The company expects this gas to be developed and booked as proved reserves in the future.\nOver the past 10 years, ExxonMobil has replaced 115 percent of the reserves it produced, including the impact of asset sales.\n“ExxonMobil has a successful track record of proved reserves replacement over the long term, demonstrating the strength of our global strategy to identify, evaluate, capture and advance high-quality opportunities,” said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer.\n“Our proved reserves represent a diverse portfolio that positions us to create shareholder value as we supply long-term energy demand growth. We will continue to apply our disciplined, paced investing approach as we develop our industry-leading resource base.”\nReserves additions in 2015 reflect new developments as well as revisions and extensions of existing fields resulting from drilling, studies and analysis of reservoir performance. The annual reporting of proved reserves is the product of the corporation’s long-standing, rigorous process that ensures consistency and management accountability in all reserves bookings. Consistent with SEC requirements, ExxonMobil reports reserves based on the historic average market prices on the first day of each calendar month during the year.\nResource Base\nDuring 2015, ExxonMobil added 1.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its resource base through by-the-bit exploration discoveries, undeveloped resource additions and strategic acquisitions.\nExxonMobil’s by-the-bit exploration success in 2015 included a significant oil discovery offshore Guyana and additional discoveries in Iraq, Australia, Romania and Nigeria. Strategic unconventional resource additions were made in the Permian Basin in West Texas, Canada and Argentina.\nOverall, the corporation’s resource base totaled more than 91 billion oil-equivalent barrels at year-end 2015, taking into account field revisions, production and asset sales. The resource base includes proved reserves, plus other discovered resources that are expected to be ultimately recovered.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE: Proved reserve figures in this release are based on current SEC definitions. Reserves also include oil sands and equity company reserves for all periods, which were excluded from SEC reserves prior to 2009.\nThe reserves replacement ratio is calculated for a specified period utilizing the applicable proved oil-equivalent reserves additions divided by oil-equivalent production.\nThe terms “resources” and “resource base” include quantities of discovered oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves but that are expected to be ultimately recovered in the future. The term “resource base” is not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as “probable” or “possible” reserves.\nThe term “project” as used in this release does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2016-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil announces 2015 reserves additions","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) said today it added 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved oil and gas reserves in 2015, replacing 67 percent of production, including a 219 percent replacement ratio for crude oil and other liquids.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2016\/0219_ExxonMobil-Announces-2015-reserves-additions","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

The projects will center on solar and battery technologies, plasma physics, Arctic sea-ice modeling, and the impact of carbon dioxide absorption on the world’s oceans. \n  * Projects to focus on solar and battery technologies, plasma physics and Arctic sea-ice modeling\n  * ExxonMobil has committed $5 million toward Princeton partnership for new energy research\n  * ExxonMobil engaged in similar energy partnerships with MIT and University of Texas \nThis announcement follows ExxonMobil’s June 2015 commitment to contribute $5 million over five years to the Princeton E-ffiliates Partnership, a program administered by Princeton University’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment that fosters research in sustainable energy and environmental solutions. E-ffiliates promotes collaboration between industry and academia to search for energy and environmental breakthroughs. Over the past year, ExxonMobil scientists have collaborated with Princeton professors to identify areas with the most scientific potential, particularly ones that build on the university’s existing strengths and interests in emerging energy.  \n“Each of the five selected projects is a potential game-changer in terms of new energy development and better understanding of our natural environment,” said Eric Herbolzheimer, senior scientific advisor and section head of engineering physics at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. “For example, we will examine whether photovoltaic properties can be embedded directly into polymers that could be used as coatings on building materials. Such technologies could complement current roof-mounted solar technologies and build upon our leadership in the chemical industry.”\n“The collaboration with ExxonMobil is a win-win,” said Lynn Loo, director of Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. “ExxonMobil gains insight into new developments in emerging energy and the Princeton community benefits from industry’s view of the challenges of meeting global energy demands while being responsive to environmental impacts.”\nIn the coming months, Princeton’s professors will select graduate research students to be named ExxonMobil Emerging Technology Fellows. The five selected projects and the professors who will lead them are as follows:\nOrganic Photovoltaics: The objective is to study how new photovoltaic materials, particularly those polymeric in nature, can be applied in forms of coatings and building materials. The project will be led by Lynn Loo, director of the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, the Theodora D. '78 and William H. Walton III '74 Professor in Engineering, and professor of chemical and biological engineering.\nExtending Battery Lifetime and Cycle Efficiency: The project will use diagnostic tools recently developed at Princeton to study degradation pathways of electric-vehicle batteries, and how they might impact follow-on use in applications on the power grid, known as “second life” applications. Research will be led by Daniel Steingart, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment.\nArctic Sea-Ice Modeling: The focus of the project is to advance sea-ice models used for understanding the factors controlling Arctic sea-ice cycles and, consequently, the ability to make reliable seasonal and long-range forecasts for sea-ice formation and melting. Research will be conducted at Princeton’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, a premier institution that has been developing state-of-the-art sea-ice modeling tools for decades. The project will be led by Alistair Adcroft, research oceanographer, and Olga Sergienko, research glaciologist, at the Princeton University Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences Program\/NOAA-Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.\nRole of the Ocean in the Future of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Levels: The project’s objective is to gain insight into the future of carbon dioxide uptake by the ocean by reconstructing ocean carbon cycle changes during past periods of warming. Research will be led by Daniel Sigman, Dusenbury Professor of Geological and Geophysical Sciences.\nPlasma Physics: The project will take advantage of Princeton’s world-leading facilities for studying plasma physics. It will explore low-energy plasmas’ effectiveness in enhancing or controlling energy-related chemical processes, such as converting natural gas to larger molecules for producing liquid fuels or chemical feedstocks. Egemen Kolemen, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment and the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, is leading this research with Yiguang Ju, Robert Porter Patterson Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.\nPrinceton’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment is one of three university energy centers to partner with ExxonMobil to conduct fundamental research on technologies that can provide low-carbon energy solutions while meeting global energy demand, which is expected to rise by about 25 percent between now and 2040 as population and living standards rise. ExxonMobil’s $5 million contribution to Princeton E-ffiliates Partnership remains the program’s single largest financial commitment.\nLast month, ExxonMobil announced that it would invest $15 million to the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute to pursue technologies to help meet growing energy demand while reducing environmental impacts and the risk of climate change.\nIn 2014, ExxonMobil became a founding member of the MIT Energy Initiative, contributing $25 million over five years to support research and establish 10 graduate energy fellowship appointments each year.\nThese efforts are in addition to the more than 80 universities that ExxonMobil partners with on research programs to explore new energy solutions.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2016-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil and Princeton University announce new energy research projects","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas — ExxonMobil and Princeton University today announced the selection of five research projects associated with their partnership focused on energy technologies.

{"id":6711,"text":"HOUSTON — ExxonMobil announced today its development of cMISTTM technology, which dehydrates natural gas using a patented absorption system inside pipes and replaces the need for conventional dehydration tower technology. This “in-line” technology could be deployed at both land-based and offshore natural gas production operations.\n  * Represents a step-change in efficiency and significant reduction in operational footprint\n  * Size, weight and cost of natural gas dehydration reduced for land-based and offshore operations\n  * Technology licensed to Sulzer for commercial application across the industry \nThe new technology, developed and extensively field-tested by ExxonMobil, more efficiently removes water vapor present during the production of natural gas. Removing water vapor through the use of dehydration technology, typically accomplished using large and expensive dehydration towers, reduces corrosion and equipment interference helping to ensure the safe and efficient transport of natural gas through the supply infrastructure and ultimately to consumers.  \ncMIST reduces the size, weight and cost of dehydration, resulting in reductions of surface footprint by 70 percent and the overall dehydration system’s weight by half, which has significant added benefits on offshore applications.\n“By leveraging our industry-leading experience with upstream applications, our researchers were able to create this advanced natural gas dehydration technology, which represents a step-change in operational efficiency and a significant reduction in footprint,” said Tom Schuessler, president of ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company.\nExxonMobil’s cMIST technology relies on a proprietary droplet generator to break up conventional solvent into tiny droplets that become well dispersed in the gas flow thereby increasing the surface area for the absorption of water from the gas. This is followed by an inline separator that coalesces the water-rich glycol droplets and moves them to the outside wall of the pipe for effective separation from the dehydrated natural gas. The water-rich glycol is regenerated using a conventional system and is sent back to the droplet generator to be used again. The droplet generator uses the energy from the flowing natural gas to create droplets of the right size.\nExxonMobil has licensed cMIST technology to the Chemtech division of Sulzer, a leading player in separation technologies, to facilitate deployment across the oil and gas industry.\n“We are proud to have been selected as worldwide exclusive licensee of the cMIST technology, which includes our patented compact HiPer™ inline separator,” said Torsten Wintergerste, president of the Chemtech division. “We look forward to servicing the oil and gas industry with this unique technology, allowing for much needed reductions in capital expenditures for both greenfield projects and existing facilities seeking brownfield debottlenecking opportunities. cMIST technology complements the Sulzer line of compact multi-phase separation technologies and will maximize benefits available to oil & gas operating companies around the world.”\nExxonMobil’s Houston-based Upstream Research Company and New Jersey-based ExxonMobil Research and Engineering division develop a range of innovative technologies aimed at producing energy more efficiently. The two organizations employ more than 1,000 PhD scientists and engineers.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2017-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil develops efficient new technology to dehydrate natural gas","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"HOUSTON — ExxonMobil announced today its development of cMISTTM technology, which dehydrates natural gas using a patented absorption system inside pipes and replaces the need for conventional dehydration tower technology.

{"id":6723,"text":"IRVING, Texas — Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today proved reserves were 20 billion oil-equivalent barrels at year-end 2016, inclusive of a net reduction of 3.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels from 2015. \nReserves changes in 2016 reflect new developments as well as revisions and extensions to existing fields resulting from drilling, studies, analysis of reservoir performance and application of the methodology prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAs a result of very low prices during 2016, certain quantities of liquids and natural gas no longer qualified as proved reserves under SEC guidelines.\nThese amounts included the entire 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl in Alberta, Canada. Another 800 million oil-equivalent barrels in North America did not qualify as proved reserves, mainly due to the acceleration of the projected economic end-of-field life. These revisions are not expected to affect the operation of the underlying projects or to alter the company’s outlook for future production volumes. The reductions were partially offset by reserves additions of oil and natural gas totaling approximately 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the U.S., Kazakhstan, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Norway, which replaced 65 percent of production and were the result of acquisitions, improved asset performance and a decision to fund an expansion of the Tengiz project in Kazakhstan.\nConsistent with SEC requirements, ExxonMobil reports reserves based on the average of the applicable market price prevailing on the first day of each calendar month during the year. Prices to date in 2017 have been higher than the average first-of-month prices in 2016. Among the factors that would result in these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline in costs, and \/ or operating efficiencies.\nThe annual reporting of proved reserves is the product of the corporation’s long-standing, rigorous process that ensures consistency and management accountability in all reserves bookings. Over the past 10 years, ExxonMobil has added proved oil and gas reserves totaling approximately 13 billion oil-equivalent barrels, including the impact of asset sales, replacing 82 percent of produced volumes. ExxonMobil’s reserves life at current production rates is 13 years. Liquids account for 53 percent of proved reserves.\nResource Base\nDuring 2016, ExxonMobil added nearly 2.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its resource base through by-the-bit exploration discoveries, undeveloped resource additions and strategic acquisitions. The resource base includes proved reserves, plus other discovered resources that are expected to be ultimately recovered.\nExxonMobil’s by-the-bit exploration success in 2016 included significant oil discoveries in Nigeria and Guyana. Strategic unconventional resource additions were made in the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania, the Permian Basin in West Texas and Neuquén Province in Argentina.\nOverall, the corporation’s resource base totaled more than 91 billion oil-equivalent barrels at year-end 2016, taking into account field revisions, production and asset sales.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE: Proved reserve figures in this release are based on current SEC definitions. Reserves also include oil sands and equity company reserves for all periods, which were excluded from SEC reserves prior to 2009.\nThe terms “resources” and “resource base” include quantities of discovered oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves but that are expected to be ultimately recovered in the future. The term “resource base” is not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as “probable” or “possible” reserves.\nThe term “project” as used in this release does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2017-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil announces 2016 reserves","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas — Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today proved reserves were 20 billion oil-equivalent barrels at year-end 2016, inclusive of a net reduction of 3.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels from 2015. \n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2017\/0222_ExxonMobil-announces-2016-reserves","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6759,"text":"IRVING, Texas & LA JOLLA, Calif. — ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics Inc. today announced a breakthrough in joint research into advanced biofuels involving the modification of an algae strain that more than doubled its oil content without significantly inhibiting the strain’s growth.\n  * Algae strain developed and modified by Synthetic Genomics more than doubled oil production\n  * Additional research and testing required before commercial application\n  * Results published in peer-reviewed journal Nature Biotechnology\nUsing advanced cell engineering technologies at Synthetic Genomics, the ExxonMobil-Synthetic Genomics research team modified an algae strain to enhance the algae’s oil content from 20 percent to more than 40 percent. Results of the research were published today in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Biotechnology by lead authors Imad Ajjawi and Eric Moellering of Synthetic Genomics.  \nResearchers at Synthetic Genomics’ laboratory in La Jolla discovered a new process for increasing oil production by identifying a genetic switch that could be fine-tuned to regulate the conversion of carbon to oil in the algae species, Nannochloropsis gaditana. The team established a proof-of-concept approach that resulted in the algae doubling its lipid fraction of cellular carbon compared to the parent – while sustaining growth.\n“This key milestone in our advanced biofuels program confirms our belief that algae can be incredibly productive as a renewable energy source with a corresponding positive contribution to our environment,” said Vijay Swarup, vice president for research and development at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. “Our work with Synthetic Genomics continues to be an important part of our broader research into lower-emission technologies to reduce the risk of climate change.”\n“The major inputs for phototropic algae production are sunlight and carbon dioxide, two resources that are abundant, sustainable and free,” said Oliver Fetzer, Ph.D., chief executive officer at Synthetic Genomics. “Discoveries made through our partnership with ExxonMobil demonstrate how advanced cell engineering capabilities at Synthetic Genomics can unlock biology to optimize how we use these resources and create solutions for many of today’s sustainability challenges – from renewable energy to nutrition and human health.”\nAlgae has been regarded as a potential sustainable fuel option, but researchers have been hindered for the past decade in developing a strain that is high in oil content and grows quickly – two critical characteristics for scalable and cost-efficient oil production. Slower growth has been an adverse effect of previous attempts to increase algae oil production volume.\nA key objective of the ExxonMobil-Synthetic Genomics collaboration has been to increase the lipid content of algae while decreasing the starch and protein components without inhibiting the algae’s growth. Limiting availability of nutrients such as nitrogen is one way to increase oil production in algae, but it can also dramatically inhibit or even stop photosynthesis, stunting algae growth and ultimately the volume of oil produced.\nThe ability to sustain growth while increasing oil content is an important advance. Algae has other advantages over traditional biofuels because it can grow in salt water and thrive in harsh environmental conditions, therefore limiting stress on food and fresh water supplies.\nOil from algae can also potentially be processed in conventional refineries, producing fuels no different from convenient, energy-dense diesel. Oil produced from algae also holds promise as a potential feedstock for chemical manufacturing.\n“The SGI-ExxonMobil science teams have made significant advances over the last several years in efforts to optimize lipid production in algae. This important publication today is evidence of this work, and we remain convinced that synthetic biology holds crucial answers to unlocking the potential of algae as a renewable energy source,” said J. Craig Venter, Ph.D., Synthetic Genomics co-founder and chairman. “We look forward to continued work with ExxonMobil so that eventually we will indeed have a viable alternative energy source.”\nSince 2009, ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics have been partners in researching and developing oil from algae to be used as a renewable, lower-emission alternative to traditional transportation fuels. Swarup said that while the breakthrough is an important step, the technology is still many years from potentially reaching the commercial market.\n“Advancements as potentially important as this require significant time and effort, as is the case with any research and development project,” Swarup said. “Each phase of our algae research, or any other similar project in the area of advanced biofuels, requires testing and analysis to confirm that we’re proceeding down a path toward scale and commercial viability.”\nExxonMobil is engaged in a wide range of research on advanced biofuels, partnering with universities, government laboratories, and other companies. Global demand for transportation-related energy is projected to increase by about 25 percent through 2040, and accelerating the reduction in emissions from the transportation sector will play a critical role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.\nExxonMobil is also actively researching other emission-reducing technologies, including carbon capture and sequestration. In 2016, ExxonMobil announced its partnership with Connecticut-based FuelCell Energy, Inc. to advance the use of carbonate fuel cells to economically capture carbon emissions from power plants while generating hydrogen and additional electricity. Since 2000, ExxonMobil has spent about $8 billion to develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions across its operations.\nNote to editors: \nVijay Swarup, Craig Venter and Oliver Fetzer will discuss the research breakthrough and answer questions during a media briefing scheduled for 10 a.m. PDT today at the San Diego Convention Center, located at 111 W. Harbor Drive, in Room 32B on the upper level.

The increased support builds on $1 million in previous contributions to the American Red Cross and United Way of Greater Houston.\nExxonMobil is working to limit the disruption of fuel supplies in the region caused by shutdowns of refining and transportation infrastructure due to weather and flooding. Efforts are underway to transport refined products from unaffected regions to communities and customers in the most severely impacted markets. The company is working to reestablish normal operations and replenish fuel supplies as safely and quickly as possible. In the meantime, consumers are encouraged to be conservative with fuel use to help preserve supplies for first responders and other critical users.\n“Our thoughts and sympathies remain with our colleagues, families, friends and neighbors in communities suffering from the storm’s effects,” said Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our primary focus remains the safety and security of our employees, facilities and neighbors in Houston, Beaumont and other impacted areas.”\nThe company is assessing its Upstream, Downstream and Chemical facilities located along the Texas Gulf Coast.\n“We are continuously monitoring the status and effects of the storm and will determine when we can begin to restore our refining, chemical and oil production to pre-storm capacity safely,” Woods said. “We understand the impacts reduced production is generally having across the region, and we’re working as hard as possible to bring our facilities back online quickly and safely.”\nRefining, Supply and Chemical Operations\nImpact assessments are underway at ExxonMobil’s Baytown complex, which has safely shut down the majority of its operations. There have been no reports of oil or gasoline leakage from the complex. The nearby Mont Belvieu plastics plant is also shut down.\nThe company’s Beaumont refinery and chemical plants have completed safe and systematic shut down of their operations.\nExxonMobil’s Baton Rouge, La., refining and chemical facilities are operating as normal.\nThe company is actively monitoring emissions as a result of the storm and remains in close contact with neighboring communities regarding safety and environmental issues.\nOil and Natural Gas Production\nExxonMobil’s Hoover and Galveston 209 platforms in the Gulf of Mexico remain shut in, and crews are in the process of assessing those operations.

Health and counseling services are also being provided to those employees who wish to take advantage of these programs.\nExxonMobil’s disaster assistance zero-interest loan program is available for employees living in Texas counties designated as federal disasters who incurred damage to personal property due to the storm.\nVarious hotlines providing updated information are available to employees across different geographical locations, and the company has activated its automated employee tracking system to help ensure their safety and wellbeing.\nNon-essential staff have been encouraged to remain at home to avoid potentially dangerous road conditions, and all employees have been asked to maintain consistent communication with supervisors regarding their status, safety and any additional weather-related challenges they may be experiencing.\nExxonMobil is advising employees in impacted areas to stay tuned to news and government updates, as well as travel advisories to receive the most current information.\nVolunteerism and In-Kind Support\nExxonMobil has a proud history of employee volunteerism. Many employees are already contributing and making themselves available to support various relief and recovery efforts. The company continues to assess community needs in impacted areas and remains in contact with government authorities and disaster relief agencies.\nExxonMobil announced today that it is launching an employee and retiree donation match program to support relief and recovery. Employee and retiree contributions to the American Red Cross and Salvation Army will be matched on a one-to-one basis up to $25,000 per contribution and up to $3 million in total, which will generate up to $6 million for the disaster relief organizations.\nEmployees may also take advantage of the company’s volunteer involvement program. In the United States, the program provides qualified organizations a $500 donation on the employee’s behalf for every 20 hours volunteered, up to four times per volunteer per year.\nExxonMobil also has donated $2.3 million in advertising time to the Red Cross that will be dedicated to high-profile televised public service announcements.\nAnd crews from ExxonMobil’s proposed petrochemical project with SABIC in South Texas have begun cleaning up debris from Hurricane Harvey. The project, Gulf Coast Growth Ventures, diverted a project subcontractor from site preparation work to provide heavy equipment and local workers to Gregory, Portland, Ingleside and surrounding communities to assist with post-storm cleanup efforts.\nBay Ltd., subcontracted by Amec Foster Wheeler, will conduct civil and site maintenance work for the Gulf Coast Growth Ventures Project as it progresses.\nExxonMobil has more than 23,000 employees in Texas and Louisiana.

{"id":6783,"text":"IRVING, Texas — Exxon Mobil Corporation announced estimated third quarter 2017 earnings of $4 billion, or $0.93 per diluted share, compared with $2.7 billion a year earlier as commodity prices improved and performance in the Upstream and Downstream strengthened. Impacts related to Hurricane Harvey reduced earnings by an estimated 4 cents per share.\n  * Cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeds dividends and net investments1 for the fourth-consecutive quarter\n  * Company makes fifth Guyana discovery; captures 12 high-potential blocks offshore Brazil\n  * Hurricane Harvey reduces earnings by an estimated $160 million, or 4 cents per share\n“A 50 percent increase in earnings through solid business performance and higher commodity prices is a step forward in our plan to grow profitability,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “For the fourth-consecutive quarter, we generated cash flow from operations and asset sales that more than covered our dividends and net investments in the business.”\nUpstream earnings rose to $1.6 billion as commodity prices increased. Building on its recent success in deepwater exploration, such as the Turbot discovery in Guyana, ExxonMobil added 12 offshore blocks in Brazil, capturing acreage with high resource potential and competitive fiscal terms.\nDownstream results increased to $1.5 billion, despite Hurricane Harvey impacts and the absence of favorable asset management gains of $380 million in the prior year from the sale of Canadian retail assets. These results were achieved as the company worked quickly to safely bring refineries back online following the storm and to restore product supplies.\nChemical earnings were $1.1 billion, down slightly from a year ago on lower commodity margins and hurricane impacts, partially offset by volume growth. During the quarter the company enhanced its position to capture growing demand in Asia by completing the purchase of an aromatics plant in Singapore.\n1 Includes additions to property, plant and equipment and net investments \/ advances\n Third Quarter 2017 Highlights\n  * Earnings of $4 billion increased 50 percent from the third quarter of 2016.\n  * Earnings per share assuming dilution were $0.93.\n  * Cash flow from operations and asset sales increased 33 percent to $8.4 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $854 million.\n  * Capital and exploration expenditures were $6 billion, including an aromatics plant acquisition in Singapore.\n  * Oil-equivalent production was 3.9 million barrels per day, up 2 percent from the prior year. Excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil-equivalent production remained at 2 percent higher than the prior year.\n  * The corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to shareholders.\n  * Dividends per share of $0.77 increased 2.7 percent compared to the third quarter of 2016.\n  * The company acquired an interest in 12 blocks offshore Brazil during the last bid round completed during the quarter. The bid resulted in the addition of 2 million high-potential acres with competitive fiscal terms.\n  * The company completed the Turbot-1 exploration well offshore Guyana. The well encountered 75 feet (23 meters) of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone, and represents ExxonMobil’s fifth discovery to date in the country.\n  * ExxonMobil signed a production sharing contract for Block 59 located 190 miles (305 kilometers) offshore Suriname. The deepwater block has an area of 2.8 million acres and significantly expands the corporation’s operated acreage in the Guyana-Suriname basin.\n  * During the quarter, ExxonMobil announced it added 22,000 acres since May to its Permian Basin portfolio through a series of acquisitions and acreage trades. Located in the Delaware and Midland Basins, the new acreage adds over 400 million oil-equivalent barrels to the company’s existing Permian Basin resource base of 6 billion oil-equivalent barrels.\n  * ExxonMobil completed the acquisition of one of the world’s largest aromatics facilities, located in Singapore, from Jurong Aromatics Corporation Pte Ltd. The acquisition will provide operational and logistical synergies between the plant and ExxonMobil’s integrated refining and petrochemical complex, as well as increase ExxonMobil Singapore’s aromatics production to over 3.5 million metric tons per year.\n Third Quarter 2017 vs. Third Quarter 2016\nUpstream earnings were $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2017, up $947 million from the third quarter of 2016. Higher liquids and gas realizations increased earnings by $860 million. Higher volume and mix effects increased earnings by $20 million. All other items increased earnings by $70 million as lower expenses were partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects.\nOn an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 2 percent from the third quarter of 2016. Liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day, up 69,000 barrels per day as lower downtime and higher project volumes were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production was 9.6 billion cubic feet per day, down 16 million cubic feet per day from 2016 as field decline and lower demand were partly offset by project ramp-up, primarily in Australia, and work programs.\nU.S. Upstream results were a loss of $238 million in the third quarter of 2017, compared to a loss of $477 million in the third quarter of 2016. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $1.8 billion, up $708 million from the prior year.\nDownstream earnings were $1.5 billion, up $303 million from the third quarter of 2016. Higher refining margins increased earnings by $1 billion. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $160 million. All other items decreased earnings by $550 million, reflecting the absence of favorable asset management gains of $380 million in the prior year from the sale of Canadian retail assets and higher expenses related to Hurricane Harvey. Petroleum product sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 43,000 barrels per day lower than last year’s third quarter.\nEarnings from the U.S. Downstream were $391 million, up $166 million from the third quarter of 2016.

Higher realizations increased earnings by $4.1 billion. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $300 million. All other items increased earnings by $380 million, primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by unfavorable tax items in the current year.\nOn an oil-equivalent basis, production of 4 million barrels per day was down 1 percent compared to 2016. Liquids production of 2.3 million barrels per day decreased 65,000 barrels per day as field decline and lower entitlements were partly offset by increased project volumes and work programs. Natural gas production of 10.1 billion cubic feet per day increased 106 million cubic feet per day from 2016 as project ramp-up, primarily in Australia, was partly offset by field decline.\nU.S. Upstream results were a loss of $439 million in 2017, compared to a loss of $1.8 billion in 2016. Earnings outside the U.S. were $5.4 billion, up $2.8 billion from the prior year.\nDownstream earnings of $4 billion increased $1.1 billion from 2016. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $1.3 billion, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $110 million. All other items decreased earnings by $290 million, mainly reflecting the absence of the Canadian retail assets sale. Petroleum product sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 26,000 barrels per day higher than 2016.\nU.S. Downstream earnings were $1 billion, an increase of $206 million from 2016. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $3 billion, up $867 million from the prior year.\nChemical earnings of $3.2 billion decreased $495 million from 2016. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $320 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $70 million. All other items decreased earnings by $250 million, primarily due to higher expenses from increased turnaround activity and new business growth. Prime product sales of 18.6 million metric tons were up 22,000 metric tons from the first nine months of 2016.\nU.S. Chemical earnings were $1.4 billion, down $111 million from 2016. Non-U.S. Chemical earnings of $1.8 billion were $384 million lower than prior year.\nCorporate and financing expenses were $954 million in 2017 compared to $1.4 billion in 2016, with the decrease mainly due to favorable impacts from the resolution of long-standing tax items.\nDuring the first nine months of 2017, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 6 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $496 million. These shares were acquired to offset dilution in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. The corporation will continue to acquire shares to offset dilution in conjunction with its benefit plans and programs, but does not currently plan on making purchases to reduce shares outstanding. The company also issued a combined 96 million shares of common stock during the first quarter to complete the acquisition of InterOil Corporation and the acquisition of entities that own oil and gas properties located primarily in the Permian Basin.\n Forward-looking Statements\nAs part of its annual planning and budgeting cycle which is completed in the fourth quarter each year, the corporation develops crude and natural gas price outlooks as well as estimates of future costs and other factors necessary to complete its plan. Management’s price outlook and other factors, including factors such as operating costs, resource productivity, and capital efficiency, are re-assessed when facts and circumstances warrant but no less often than annually. To the extent any impairment testing may be required, management uses assumptions that are reasonable in relation to these factors in developing estimates of future cash flows. An asset group would be impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the asset’s carrying value, and impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. Development of future undiscounted cash flow estimates requires significant management judgment, particularly in cases where an asset’s life is expected to extend decades into the future, and an important component of the estimate is management’s outlook on prices and other factors as noted above.\nThe corporation has identified emerging trends such as increasing estimates of available natural gas supplies and ongoing reductions in costs of supply for natural gas. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the corporation will incorporate the impacts of these trends and the resulting lower price outlook in its annual planning and budgeting cycle. Once complete, the corporation expects to perform an impairment assessment for its North American natural gas asset groups utilizing the information developed as part of the planning and budgeting process. It is not practicable at this time to estimate the impact these trends would have on the undiscounted cash flows for individual asset groups or any resulting impairment charges. However these trends are likely to place the corporation’s North American natural gas asset groups at risk for potential impairment. The corporation will complete its analysis of relevant factors as discussed above and perform any necessary impairment testing in connection with the preparation of the corporation’s year-end financial statements for inclusion in its 2017 Form 10-K.\nExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters during a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on October 27, 2017.

{"id":6807,"text":"IRVING, Texas — Exxon Mobil Corporation announced estimated 2017 earnings of $19.7 billion, or $4.63 per share assuming dilution, compared with $7.8 billion in 2016. U.S. federal tax reform in the fourth quarter resulted in a non-cash earnings gain of $5.9 billion, due to revaluation of deferred income tax balances. Non-cash asset impairments of $1.5 billion were recorded during the year, mainly relating to assets in the Upstream.\n  * Net favorable non-cash impacts in the fourth quarter total $4.6 billion, including $5.9 billion relating to U.S. tax reform, partially offset by asset impairments of $1.3 billion\n  * Full year cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeds dividends and net investments1\n  * Company makes sixth discovery offshore Guyana, adds acreage in Brazil, closes acquisition in Mozambique\nFourth quarter 2017 earnings were $8.4 billion. Earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were $3.7 billion, or $0.88 per share assuming dilution, in the fourth quarter 2017, down 2 percent compared with the prior-year quarter.\n“The impact of tax reform on our earnings reflects the magnitude of our historic investment in the U.S. and strengthens our commitment to further grow our business here,” said Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “We’re planning to invest over $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years to increase production of profitable volumes and enhance our integrated portfolio, which is supported by the improved business climate created by tax reform.”\nExxonMobil is investing billions of dollars to increase oil production in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, expand existing operations, enhance infrastructure and build new manufacturing sites. These high-quality investments will create value for ExxonMobil shareholders while benefiting the economy, creating thousands of jobs and enhancing energy security.\nFourth quarter Upstream earnings were $8.4 billion, including $7.1 billion from U.S. tax reform and asset impairments of $1.3 billion. Fourth quarter earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments increased $1 billion, to $2.5 billion, driven by higher prices as liquids realizations increased more than $10 per barrel.\nDownstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion, including $618 million from U.S. tax reform. Earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments declined $289 million, to $952 million, as the absence of last year’s Canada retail divestment gain of $522 million was partially offset by higher margins and asset management gains in the current quarter.\nChemical earnings were $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding the $335 million impact from U.S. tax reform, Chemical earnings increased $63 million, or 7 percent, due to higher sales. Prime product sales of 6.8 million metric tons were the highest in a decade.\n1 Includes additions to property, plant and equipment and net investments \/ advances\n Fourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\n  * Earnings of $8.4 billion increased $6.7 billion from the fourth quarter of 2016.

The well encountered 230 feet (70 meters) of oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. Previous discoveries offshore Guyana are now estimated to total more than 3.2 billion recoverable oil-equivalent barrels, excluding Ranger.\n  * ExxonMobil completed an agreement with Statoil ASA to acquire an interest in the BM-S-8 block offshore Brazil, which contains part of the discovered pre-salt Carcara oil field. ExxonMobil and its partners were also the high bidder on the North Carcara block in round 2 of the pre-salt tender. The Carcara field contains an estimated recoverable resource of 2 billion barrels of high-quality oil. During the quarter, through bid rounds and announced farm-in agreements, ExxonMobil added 14 offshore blocks in Brazil comprising more than 1.25 million net acres.\n  * ExxonMobil announced the completion of a transaction to acquire a 25 percent indirect interest in Mozambique’s gas-rich Area 4 block from Eni S.p.A. and assume responsibility for midstream operations. ExxonMobil will lead the construction and operation of all future natural gas liquefaction and related facilities. The deepwater Area 4 block contains an estimated 85 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to support a world-class LNG development.\n  * During the quarter, ExxonMobil announced that the Hebron field started production safely and on schedule. The platform, located about 200 miles (350 kilometers) offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, is expected to produce up to 150,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak.\n  * The company started the Odoptu Stage 2 project safely and on schedule.

Under the agreement, ExxonMobil and INPEX Corporation have also been granted a 10 year extension for the Upper Zakum concession.\n  * During the quarter, ExxonMobil acquired a crude oil terminal in Wink, Texas, from Genesis Energy, L.P. The terminal is located in the rapidly growing Permian Basin and is strategically positioned to handle crude oil and condensate for transport to Gulf Coast refineries and marine export terminals.\n  * ExxonMobil signed production sharing contracts with the government of Mauritania for three deepwater offshore blocks. Together, the blocks comprise nearly 8.4 million acres and are located an average of 125 miles (200 kilometers) offshore Mauritania.\n  * The corporation announced that the Neuquén Province government in Argentina has approved the investment plan for the development of a 35-year unconventional exploitation concession in the Los Toldos I South block. The initial investment of about $200 million calls for a pilot project of up to seven production wells, the construction of production facilities and the development of export infrastructure.\n  * The corporation combined its refining and marketing operations into a single company, ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants Company, in the first quarter of 2018. The further integration will help the company to better respond to the needs of its customers and compete more effectively.\n  * ExxonMobil opened eight service stations in Mexico during the quarter, the first Mobil-branded service stations in the country. The new service stations will be operated by Grupo Orsan and supplied with gasoline and diesel produced by ExxonMobil’s refineries in Texas. The corporation plans to open more than 50 Mobil stations in Mexico during the first quarter of 2018.\n  * During the quarter, the company started producing on-spec product from the world’s largest hydrocarbon resin plant, located in Singapore. The new facility will produce 90,000 metric tons per year of Escorez adhesive resins to meet long-term demand growth in Asia Pacific and will double the company’s capacity to manufacture high-performance resins.\n Fourth Quarter 2017 vs. Fourth Quarter 2016\nUpstream earnings were $8.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, up $9 billion from the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher liquids and gas realizations increased earnings by $1.2 billion. Lower volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $110 million. All other items increased earnings by $7.9 billion driven by U.S. tax reform impacts of $7.1 billion, lower asset impairments of $847 million, and gains from asset management activity.\nOn an oil-equivalent basis, production was down 130,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day, down 133,000 barrels per day as field decline and lower entitlements were partly offset by higher volumes from work programs and projects. Natural gas production was 10.4 billion cubic feet per day, up 17 million cubic feet per day from 2016, as project ramp-up and work programs were partly offset by field decline and lower demand.\nU.S. Upstream earnings were $7.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, including $7.6 billion for tax reform and asset impairments of $481 million. U.S. Upstream earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were a loss of $60 million. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $1.3 billion, including asset impairments of $807 million and unfavorable impacts of $480 million from U.S. tax reform. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were $2.6 billion.\nDownstream earnings were $1.6 billion, up $323 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher margins increased earnings by $250 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $190 million. All other items increased earnings by $260 million, including favorable U.S. tax reform impacts of $618 million and gains from asset management activity, partially offset by the absence of asset management gains of $522 million in the prior year from the Canada retail divestment. Petroleum product sales of 5.6 million barrels per day were 118,000 barrels per day higher than last year’s fourth quarter.\nEarnings from the U.S. Downstream were $918 million. Excluding U.S. tax reform impacts of $618 million and asset impairments, earnings were up $36 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $646 million were $325 million lower than the prior year.\nChemical earnings of $1.3 billion were $398 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $30 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $100 million. All other items increased earnings by $330 million, driven by U.S. tax reform impacts of $335 million. Fourth quarter prime product sales of 6.8 million metric tons were 473,000 metric tons or 7 percent higher than the prior year.\nU.S. Chemical earnings were $777 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding U.S. tax reform impacts of $335 million, earnings were $90 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-U.S. Chemical earnings of $493 million were $27 million lower than prior year.\nCorporate and financing expenses were $2.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, up $3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2016 mainly due to unfavorable impacts of $2.1 billion from U.S. tax reform and the absence of favorable non-U.S. tax items in the prior-year quarter.\n Full Year 2017 Highlights\n  * Earnings of $19.7 billion increased 151 percent from $7.8 billion in 2016. Earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were $15.3 billion, up 52 percent from $10.1 billion in 2016. Hurricane Harvey reduced earnings by an estimated $250 million.\n  * Earnings per share assuming dilution were $4.63.\n  * Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $33.2 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $3.1 billion.\n  * Capital and exploration expenditures were $23.1 billion, up 20 percent from 2016.\n  * Oil-equivalent production was 4 million barrels per day, down 2 percent from the prior year. Excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil-equivalent production was flat with the prior year.\n  * The corporation distributed $13 billion in dividends to shareholders.\n Full Year 2017 vs. Full Year 2016\nUpstream earnings were $13.4 billion, up $13.2 billion from 2016. Higher realizations increased earnings by $5.3 billion. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $440 million. All other items increased earnings by $8.3 billion, primarily due to the $7.1 billion non-cash impact from U.S. tax reform, lower asset impairments of $659 million, lower expenses, and gains from asset management activity.\nOn an oil-equivalent basis, production of 4 million barrels per day was down 2 percent compared to 2016. Liquids production of 2.3 million barrels per day decreased 82,000 barrels per day as field decline and lower entitlements were partly offset by increased project volumes and work programs. Natural gas production of 10.2 billion cubic feet per day increased 84 million cubic feet per day from 2016 as project ramp-up, primarily in Australia, was partly offset by field decline and regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands.\nU.S. Upstream earnings were $6.6 billion in 2017, including $7.6 billion of tax reform benefits and asset impairments of $521 million. U.S. Upstream earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were a loss of $459 million. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $6.7 billion, including asset impairments of $983 million and unfavorable impacts of $480 million from U.S. tax reform. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were $8.2 billion.\nDownstream earnings of $5.6 billion increased $1.4 billion from 2016. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $1.5 billion, while volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $30 million. All other items decreased earnings by $40 million, driven by the absence of a $904 million gain from the Canadian retail assets sale, and Hurricane Harvey related expenses, which were mostly offset by $618 million of U.S. tax reform impacts and non-U.S. asset management gains in the current year. Petroleum product sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 48,000 barrels per day higher than 2016.\nEarnings from the U.S. Downstream were $1.9 billion. Excluding U.S. tax reform impacts of $618 million and asset impairments, earnings were up $179 million from 2016. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $3.6 billion, compared to $3.1 billion in the prior year.\nChemical earnings of $4.5 billion decreased $97 million from 2016. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $260 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $100 million. All other items increased earnings by $60 million, primarily due to U.S. tax reform of $335 million and improved inventory effects, partially offset by higher expenses from increased turnaround activity and new business growth. Prime product sales of 25.4 million metric tons were up 495,000 metric tons from 2016.\nU.S. Chemical earnings were $2.2 billion in 2017. Excluding U.S. tax reform impacts of $335 million, 2017 earnings were down $21 million from 2016. Non-U.S. Chemical earnings of $2.3 billion were $411 million lower than prior year.\nCorporate and financing expenses were $3.8 billion in 2017 compared to $1.2 billion in 2016, with the increase mainly due to unfavorable impacts of $2.1 billion from U.S. tax reform and the absence of favorable non-U.S. tax items.\nDuring 2017, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 6 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $496 million. These shares were acquired to offset dilution in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. The corporation will continue to acquire shares to offset dilution in conjunction with its benefit plans and programs, but does not currently plan on making purchases to reduce shares outstanding. The company also issued a combined 96 million shares of common stock during the first quarter to complete the acquisition of InterOil Corporation and the acquisition of entities that own oil and gas properties located primarily in the Permian Basin.\n U.S. Tax Reform\nFollowing the December 22, 2017, enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the corporation has included reasonable estimates of the income tax effects of the change in tax law and tax rate. These include amounts for the deferred income tax impact from the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and profits.\nExxonMobil’s significant historical investments in the U.S. have created large deferred income tax liabilities that have reduced previously reported earnings. Remeasurement of these deferred income tax liabilities from the 35 percent rate to 21 percent results in a one-time non-cash benefit to earnings. The corporation has paid taxes on non-U.S. earnings at tax rates on average above the U.S. rate of 35 percent. As a result, the deemed repatriation tax is not a significant item for ExxonMobil.\n Asset Impairments\nAs part of its 2017 annual planning and budgeting cycle, the corporation made a decision to cease development planning activities and further allocation of capital to certain non-producing assets outside the U.S. resulting in an after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of $807 million to reduce the carrying value of those assets. In addition, and in part due to a reduction to the corporation’s long-term natural gas price outlooks, certain asset groups were subject to an impairment assessment. As a result of that assessment, the carrying values for certain asset groups in the U.S. were reduced to fair value, resulting in an after-tax charge of $481 million. The asset groups subject to this impairment charge are primarily dry gas operations with little additional development potential.\nExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters during a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on February 2, 2018.

As part of its commitment, ExxonMobil will contribute $20 million in funding over five years to research and develop lower-carbon energy solutions.\nThe Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance builds on the success of the Global Climate and Energy Project (GCEP), also led by Stanford, which focused exclusively on low-emissions, high-efficiency energy technologies. ExxonMobil has sponsored GCEP since its inception in 2002 with a commitment of $100 million and additional contributions toward specific projects. In its 15 years of work, GCEP has evolved into a pioneering collaboration of scientists, engineers, researchers and students focused on identifying breakthrough low greenhouse gas emission energy technologies that could be developed and deployed on a large scale.\n“ExxonMobil has worked with Stanford to advance low-carbon technologies over the last 15 years, and we’re excited to be the first founding member of this new endeavor,” said Bruce March, president of the ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. “Identifying scalable solutions for addressing the dual challenge of supplying energy to meet global demand while minimizing the risk of climate change is one of our core missions. We are continuously looking for ways to improve existing supply options and manufacturing processes while managing carbon intensity.”\nSince its creation, GCEP has sponsored more than 100 research programs in the United States, Europe, Australia, China and Japan, and has resulted in over 900 papers in leading journals and more than 1,200 presentations at conferences. Building on fundamental science, significant advances have been made in the areas of photovoltaic energy, renewable and lower carbon fossil fuels, batteries and fuel cells. More than 60 technologies have also been developed and 15 patents have been issued. Multiple companies have also started up as a direct result of or inspiration from GCEP research.\nThe new Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance will pair industry alliance members and Stanford professors who share common research objectives across the spectrum of energy topics from science and engineering to policy and business. Managed by the Stanford Precourt Institute for Energy, the alliance will also fund some early-stage research at the direction of its faculty leadership.\nExxonMobil’s support for the Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance expands the company’s collaborative efforts with other academic and research institutions that are focused on developing an array of new energy technologies, improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The company currently works with about 80 universities in the United States, Europe and Asia to explore next-generation energy technologies, including founding members of MIT Energy Initiative, Princeton E-ffiliates Partnership and University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2018-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil to join Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas — Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today announced that it will become the first founding member of the \n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2018\/0301_ExxonMobil-to-join-Stanford-Strategic-Energy-Alliance","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

A final decision on the investment, anticipated to be several hundred million dollars, is expected later this year. Facility startup could come as early as 2021.\nThe new facility will be capable of producing advanced polypropylene products which can be used in high performance automotive, appliance, and packaging applications. The potential project will create more than 600 jobs during peak construction and more than 60 permanent jobs when production starts.\n“ExxonMobil is well positioned to take advantage of the growing global demand for higher-value products, in both North America and the high-growth Asia Pacific region,” said John Verity, president of ExxonMobil Chemical Company. “Abundant supplies of domestically produced oil and natural gas have reduced energy costs and created new sources of feedstock for U.S. chemical manufacturing. Most of our planned investment in the Gulf Coast region is focused on supplying emerging markets like Asia with high-demand products, which ultimately will spur new economic growth locally.”\nThese advanced polypropylene materials are key to reducing vehicle weight, which helps improve fuel efficiency and reduces carbon emissions. Modern plastics and polymer composites, which can replace steel in many applications, typically comprise about 50 percent of a new car’s volume but only 10 percent of its weight.\n“Polypropylene delivers performance and sustainability benefits to produce a wide variety of consumer products,” said Cindy Shulman, ExxonMobil’s vice president of plastics and resins. “It’s a versatile material providing high impact resistance and high stiffness to lightweight applications. It is safe, can be recycled and requires less energy to produce when compared with other plastics.”\nThis investment is one of 13 new facilities planned to grow ExxonMobil’s chemical manufacturing capacity in North America and Asia Pacific by about 40 percent. These investments, including two world-class steam crackers in the United States, will enable the company to meet increasing demand in Asia and other growing markets.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2018-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil considers polypropylene production expansion along U.S. Gulf Coast","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas — ExxonMobil said today it has started detailed engineering work on a potential U.S. Gulf Coast project to expand polypropylene manufacturing capacity by up to 450,000 tons a year to meet growing demand for high-performance, lightweight durable plastics.

Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation. “We will be a significant, long-term economic contributor to the state of New Mexico and will work hard to be a trusted member of the community.”\nThe state government will receive an estimated $62 billion in net fiscal benefits, $44 billion of which will come from new leases and royalties, according to the research. About $8.5 billion will come from state oil-and-gas severance taxes, said the study which was conducted for ExxonMobil by Impact Data Source. The research findings assume an oil price of $40 per barrel.\nFrom an employment perspective, ExxonMobil’s activities will generate an average of 4,100 direct job opportunities for New Mexicans per year for the next 40 years, the study estimates. Over the next 40 years, the company’s operations are expected to generate a total of approximately $29 billion in new wages, salaries and benefits.\nNew Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham said the industry is crucial for residents and expressed optimism about the projections.\n“The benefit to this state’s bottom line, as represented by investments from companies like ExxonMobil, has been enormous,” Gov.

Our industry has developed high-tech advances to curb emissions, and we also hope this framework will be helpful for governments as they develop new regulations,” said Woods.\nThe ExxonMobil model framework is based on its voluntary methane reduction program, which involves prioritized replacement of components with a high-leak potential at production sites, technology enhancements to infrastructure and substantial data gathering and research. More comprehensive than current federal rules, the proposed regulations would apply to new and existing sources. The company has reduced methane emissions from its U.S. unconventional operations by 20 percent since 2016 and remains on track to reach its target of 15 percent reductions across the company.\nTo achieve meaningful reductions in methane emissions, regulations should address and include four primary requirements:\n  * Leak detection and repair programs across oil and gas infrastructure \n  * Minimization of venting \n  * Operational equipment controls\n  * Record keeping and reporting to support agency enforcement\nExxonMobil has advocated in the United States for a cost-effective, federal regulatory standard to manage methane emissions from both new and existing oil and natural gas facilities. The company will continue to work constructively with state and federal regulators, industry and nongovernmental organizations to develop and implement cost-effective and reasonable methane-emission regulations.\nExxonMobil supports the Methane Guiding Principles for reducing methane emissions across the natural gas value chain, which were signed in 2017. The guiding principles are being implemented in collaboration with many stakeholders, including the Environmental Defense Fund, the International Energy Agency, the International Gas Union, the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative Climate Investment Fund, the Rocky Mountain Institute, the Sustainable Gas Institute, the Energy and Resources Institute and United Nations Environment. \n\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2020-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil proposes framework for industry-wide methane regulations","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil today released a \n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2020\/0303_ExxonMobil-proposes-framework-for-industry-wide-methane-regulations","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

We challenge ExxonMobil scientists to explore the fundamental scientific questions that underpin technology development in new ways, and they challenge our scientists to think about the practical considerations of scaling technologies,” said Yueh-Lin (Lynn) Loo, Andlinger Center director and the Theodora D. ’78 and William H. Walton ’74 Professor in Engineering. “It’s a win-win and ultimately helps us carry out a core tenet of our mission, which is to reduce emissions globally while improving access to energy around the world.”\nExxonMobil is the world-leader in carbon capture, sequestering more carbon in the last 20 years than any other company. Princeton University is advancing this technology with new research to better understand how stored CO2 flows within rocks and interacts with minerals, improving the understanding of underground storage capacity. Future CO2 storage projects can be more optimally planned and operated to achieve net emissions reductions.\nPrinceton University scientists are also working with ExxonMobil on the development of carbonate fuel cells. This is in addition to the company’s ongoing collaboration with FuelCell Energy to enhance technology for capturing CO2 from industrial facilities and electric power generation.\nOver the past five years, through the company’s participation in E-ffiliates, ExxonMobil scientists have collaborated with Princeton faculty and researchers to support early-stage research projects that are focused on identifying lower-emission technologies that can accelerate the energy transition. Results have been published in peer-reviewed journals including Nature Geoscience, Science, Applied Energy, Journal of the American Chemical Society, and Energy and Environmental Science.\nPrinceton University researchers also are working to better understand the barriers, technology needs and opportunities of the global energy transition. This research is taking a comprehensive look at potential pathways to achieve net-zero emissions in the United States by 2050, and the investments in technology, infrastructure, and skill development to achieve that goal. The fundamental approach and modeling tools developed in this pilot study will be available for global use. The effort is co-led by the Andlinger Center, along with other campus partners, and funded in part by ExxonMobil and other partners.\nPrinceton’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment is one of five university energy centers ExxonMobil has partnered with to undertake fundamental research to provide low-carbon energy solutions while meeting global energy demand.\nSince 2000, ExxonMobil has invested approximately $10 billion in projects to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions. The company also continues to expand collaborative efforts with more than 80 universities, five energy centers and multiple private sector partners around the world to explore next-generation energy technologies. \n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2020-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil renews collaboration with Princeton Energy Center to  advance low-emission research and energy solutions","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil and Princeton University’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment have renewed their collaboration to research lower-emission technologies and energy solutions.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2020\/0702_EM-renews-collaboration-with-Princeton-to--advance-low-emission-research-and-energy-solutions","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6999,"text":"IRVING, Texas – October 30, 2020 – Exxon Mobil Corporation today announced an estimated third quarter 2020 loss of $680 million, or $0.15 per share assuming dilution. Third quarter capital and exploration expenditures were $4.1 billion, bringing year-to-date spending to $16.6 billion, more than $6 billion lower than the prior year period.\n  * Third quarter results improved by $400 million from the second quarter, primarily driven by early stages of demand recovery; excluding identified items, results improved by $2.2 billion\n  * On track to exceed reduction targets for 2020 capital and cash expenses; further reductions anticipated in 2021\n  * Continued Guyana progress with third major deepwater development approval and two new discoveries\nOil-equivalent production was 3.7 million barrels per day, up 1 percent from the second quarter of 2020. Production continued to reflect COVID-19 demand impacts, including economic and government mandated curtailments. Excluding entitlement effects, divestments, and government mandates, liquids production increased 2 percent, while natural gas volumes decreased 1 percent.   \n  \n“We remain confident in our long-term strategy and the fundamentals of our business, and are taking the necessary actions to preserve value while protecting the balance sheet and dividend,” said Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “We are on pace to achieve our 2020 cost-reduction targets and are progressing additional savings next year as we manage through this unprecedented down cycle.”  \n  \nThe company’s preliminary 2021 capital program, which will be reviewed by the board of directors in the fourth quarter, is expected to be in the range of $16 billion to $19 billion, a reduction from the 2020 target of $23 billion announced in April. The company expects to identify further structural efficiencies as it continues previously announced country-by-country reviews.\n Third Quarter 2020 Business Highlights\n Upstream\n  * Average third quarter realizations for crude oil improved significantly, as market prices increased following the second quarter's challenging environment. Natural gas realizations declined, primarily due to a lag in crude-linked LNG contract pricing.\n  * Improved market conditions enabled full recovery of production impacted by economic curtailments. Government mandated curtailments negatively impacted third quarter results and are anticipated to continue in the fourth quarter.\n Downstream\n  * Supply chain optimization, higher product sales due to increased demand, and higher marketing margins more than offset lower industry fuels margins driven by market oversupply and high product inventory levels.\n  * Third quarter saw the best reliability and process performance in the last 10 years, while average refinery utilization increased about 6 percent from the second quarter on demand recovery. Refining capacity sparing decreased to about 25 percent.\n Chemical\n  * Chemical sales volumes were higher than second quarter, benefiting from resilient packaging demand and recovering automotive and construction markets. Chemical margins were negatively impacted by higher feed costs.\n  * The company's Corpus Christi chemical complex joint venture is approximately 80 percent complete, with start-up activities expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n Strengthening the Portfolio\n  * ExxonMobil announced that it has funded the Payara development offshore Guyana, following government and regulatory approvals. The third major project in the Stabroek Block will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day after expected startup in 2024. The company also made its 17th and 18th discoveries at the Yellowtail-2 and Redtail-1 wells, respectively, increasing the estimated recoverable resource to nearly 9 billion oil-equivalent barrels on the Stabroek block.\n  * During the quarter, production volumes in the Permian averaged 401,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day which included full recovery of volumes curtailed in the prior quarter. Full year 2020 production is anticipated to be approximately 360,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day. Focus remains on lowering overall development costs through efficiency gains and technology applications. Compared to 2019, drilling and completion costs decreased more than 20 percent, while drilling rates (lateral feet per day) and fracturing rates (stages per day) both increased more than 30 percent. Rig count reductions continue, with 10-15 rigs expected to be operating by year-end.\n  * ExxonMobil continues to improve its industry-leading development opportunities, as illustrated by the growth of the recoverable resource base in Guyana to nearly 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and other high-value assets in the U.S. Permian Basin, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Brazil. Given the high quality opportunities in ExxonMobil's portfolio and the constraints of the current market environment, the corporation is assessing its full portfolio to prioritize assets with the highest value potential within its broad range of available opportunities. This effort includes an ongoing re-assessment of North American dry gas assets currently included in the corporation’s development plan. Depending on the outcome of the planning process, including in particular any significant future changes to the corporation’s current development plans for its dry gas portfolio, long-lived assets with carrying values of approximately $25 billion to $30 billion could be at risk for significant impairment. If these assets remain in our long-term development plan, similar to previous years, it is unlikely the assets would be subject to material impairment. The company expects to complete this assessment in the fourth quarter.\n Disciplined Investing and Cost Management\n  * ExxonMobil made significant progress during the quarter on previously announced capital and cash operating expense reductions. Planned reductions to the 2020 capital spending program, from $33 billion to $23 billion, are ahead of schedule, reflecting increased efficiencies, lower market prices, and slower project pace. An expected decrease in cash operating expenses of about 15 percent is also ahead of schedule, capturing savings from increased efficiencies, reduced activity, and lower energy costs and volumes. \n Advancing Innovative Technologies and Products\n  * The company continued to progress work on scaling carbon-capture technologies aimed at reducing emissions. Following 12 months of technical evaluation, ExxonMobil and Global Thermostat announced an expanded joint development agreement to advance and bring to scale breakthrough technology that removes carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. ExxonMobil also announced, in collaboration with the University of California, Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the discovery of a new material that could capture more than 90 percent of carbon dioxide from industrial sources, such as natural gas-fired power plants. \n  * ExxonMobil built on the company's longstanding efforts to develop and deliver products that help meet society's energy needs while reducing environmental impacts. These efforts included an agreement with Global Clean Energy Holdings to purchase 2.5 million barrels of renewable diesel per year for five years from a Bakersfield, CA biorefinery starting in 2022. Based on analysis of California Air Resources Board (CARB) data, renewable diesel from various non-petroleum feedstocks can provide life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions of approximately 40 percent to 80 percent compared to petroleum-based diesel.\n First Nine Months 2020 Financial Updates\nDuring the first nine months of 2020, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 6 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $305 million. These shares were acquired to offset dilution in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. The corporation will continue to acquire shares to offset dilution in conjunction with its benefit plans and programs.  \n  \nExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters during a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on October 30, 2020.

{"id":7023,"text":"IRVING, Texas \/ STUTTGART, Germany – ExxonMobil and Porsche are testing advanced biofuels and renewable, lower-carbon eFuels, as part of a new agreement to find pathways toward potential future consumer adoption. \n  * Esso Renewable Racing Fuel to be tested in Porsche’s high-performance motorsports engines in the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup 2021\n  * Companies to advance eFuel development with potential for greenhouse gas reduction\n  * eFuels to be produced using hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide \n  * New agreement builds on 25-year relationship of developing and testing high-performance products \nThe first iteration of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel is a blend of primarily advanced biofuels and is specially formulated by ExxonMobil’s in-house team of scientists and engineers. Analysis indicates the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a liquid fuel. The fuel will be tested in race conditions with Porsche’s high-performance motorsports engines during the 2021 Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup race series.   \n  \nPorsche and ExxonMobil’s collaboration will also focus on eFuels, which are synthetic fuels made from hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide. As early as 2022, the companies plan to test the second iteration of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel, which will contain eFuel components. The eFuel is anticipated to achieve a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of up to 85 percent, when blended to current market fuel standards for today’s passenger vehicles.i  \n  \n“The electrification of our vehicles is of highest priority to us,” said Michael Steiner, Member of the Executive Board, Research and Development of Porsche. “eFuels are a good complement to our powertrain strategy. They allow our customers to drive cars with conventional combustion engines as well as plug-in hybrids with significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions. The collaboration with ExxonMobil enables us to test the eFuels under demanding conditions on the racing track. This is a further step towards making eFuels an affordable and lower greenhouse gas emission substitute to conventional fuels.”  \n  \nThe eFuel will be sourced from the Haru Oni pilot plant based in Chile that generates hydrogen, which is then combined with captured carbon dioxide drawn from the atmosphere to produce methanol. ExxonMobil is providing a license and support for the proprietary technology to convert the methanol to gasoline, which will result in a lower-carbon fuel.   \n  \nIn the pilot phase, around 35,000 gallons of eFuels will be produced in 2022. As the fuel’s primary user, Porsche will use the eFuels from Chile among others in the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup starting in the season of 2022.  \n  \n“Over the past quarter century, we have worked together with Porsche to develop high-performance products that support Porsche’s vehicle performance on the racetrack and on the road,” said Andy Madden, vice president of strategy and planning for ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants. “Our continued collaboration on renewable and eFuels is a critical step in assessing the technical capability and commercial viability of fuels that can significantly reduce emissions.”  \n  \nThe first on-track testing of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel is scheduled for March 30, 2021 in Zandvoort, Netherlands, and will continue throughout the 2021 and 2022 Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup race series.   \n  \nThe collaboration with Porsche builds on ExxonMobil’s continuing efforts to develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions, including high-efficiency fuels and lubricants, advanced plastics and other products that can enable cars and trucks to use less fuel. For example, the two companies have collaborated on a line of specially formulated lubricants for the electric vehicles market, Mobil EVTM range.  \n  \nIn January, ExxonMobil announced the creation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, to commercialize its extensive low-carbon technology portfolio and plans to invest $3 billion on lower emission energy solutions through 2025. Last year, ExxonMobil announced plans to distribute renewable diesel within California and potentially other domestic and international markets as soon as 2022.   \n  \nOver the past two decades, ExxonMobil has invested more than $10 billion to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions, resulting in highly efficient operations that have eliminated or avoided approximately 480 million tonnes of CO2 emissions - the equivalent of taking more than 100 million passenger vehicles off the road for a year.ii  \n  \nPorsche is committed to invest $17.9 billion in electromobility and digitalization by 2025. In 2030 the sports car manufacturer will offer more than 80 percent of its vehicles with electric engines. The company seeks carbon neutrality in its products and operations by 2030, investing around $1.2 billion in sustainable mobility.   \n  \n\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2021-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil and Porsche test lower-carbon fuel in race conditions","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas \/ STUTTGART, Germany – ExxonMobil and Porsche are testing advanced biofuels and renewable, lower-carbon eFuels, as part of a new agreement to find pathways toward potential future consumer adoption. \n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2021\/0330_ExxonMobil-and-Porsche-test-lower-carbon-fuel-in-race-conditions","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

First quarter capital and exploration expenditures were $3.1 billion, $4 billion lower than the first quarter of 2020.\nFirst Quarter 2021 Results and Management Perspectives \n  * Cash flow from operating activities of $9.3 billion fully funded dividend and capital expenditures, and drove debt reduction of over $4 billion \n  * Lowered cash operating expenses versus the first and fourth quarters of 2020; on pace to deliver additional structural cost savings \n  * Advanced several initiatives to reduce emissions and launched Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize extensive low-carbon technology portfolio \n  * Added three new directors to strengthen board experience in energy, capital allocation and complex business transitions\nOil-equivalent production was 3.8 million barrels per day, up 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding entitlement effects, government mandates and divestments, oil-equivalent production was up 2 percent. \n“The strong first quarter results reflect the benefits of higher commodity prices and our focus on structural cost reductions, while prioritizing investments in assets with a low cost of supply,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter fully covered the dividend and capital investments, and we strengthened the balance sheet by reducing debt. We also made progress on our energy transition strategy by launching our new ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business, which is initially working to develop innovative, large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) concepts, including the evaluation and advancement of more than 20 new opportunities, such as a multi-industry hub to reduce emissions from hard-to-decarbonize industries near the Houston Ship Channel. As the global leader in carbon capture, we are seeing growing public and private sector support for CCS as a critical enabling technology to reduce emissions and help meet society's net-zero ambitions.” \nDuring severe winter weather in Texas in February, ExxonMobil cogeneration facilities generated 400 megawatts of electricity, helping to power about 200,000 homes. The severe weather event reduced first quarter earnings by nearly $600 million across all businesses from decreased production and lower sales volumes, repair costs, and the net impact of energy purchases and sales. All affected facilities have resumed normal operations.\n First Quarter 2021 Results and Business Highlights\n Upstream\n  * Average realizations for crude oil increased 42 percent from the fourth quarter. Natural gas realizations rose by 33 percent in the quarter.\n  * Total production volumes increased 98,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day from the fourth quarter. Excluding entitlement effects, government mandates and divestments, liquids volumes were down 3 percent including impacts from higher maintenance and the winter storm. Natural gas volumes increased 12 percent driven by higher seasonal demand in Europe. \n  * During the quarter, production volumes in the Permian averaged 394,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 12 percent from the prior year. The focus remains on continuing to grow positive free cash flow by lowering overall development costs and increasing recovery through efficiency gains and technology applications.\n Downstream \n  * Industry fuels margins improved from the fourth quarter, but remained below 10-year-lows driven by market oversupply and high product inventory levels. Lubricants delivered strong performance, underpinned by lower costs and improved margins. \n  * Despite winter storm disruptions, overall refining throughput was essentially flat with the fourth quarter as the company managed refinery operations in line with fuel demand and integrated chemical manufacturing needs. \n Chemical \n  * Industry margins improved further in the quarter reflecting continued strong demand, global shipping constraints, and ongoing supply disruptions, particularly in North America, where the polyethylene and polypropylene markets were affected by severe winter weather in Texas. \n  * Strong first quarter Chemical earnings performance of $1.4 billion was supported by robust base operations capturing high margins and continued delivery of cost efficiencies. \n  * ExxonMobil announced it is pursuing three new advanced recycling initiatives in the U.S. and Europe that further advance our commitment to sustainability and capture value from plastic waste at scale. The company plans to begin marketing certified circular plastics products later this year. \n Strengthening the Portfolio\n  * ExxonMobil signed an agreement valued at more than $1 billion for the sale of most of its non-operated upstream assets in the United Kingdom central and northern North Sea. The sale price, subject to closing adjustments, has potential additional upside of up to $300 million based on contingent payments associated with future commodity price increases. The transaction is expected to close near mid-year 2021, subject to regulatory and third-party approvals. \n  * The company is progressing plans to convert both its Altona, Australia refinery, and Slagen refinery in Norway to fuel import terminals, ensuring ongoing, reliable fuel supply for their respective local markets. Final decisions were made following local consultation processes with employees and their representatives as part of extensive reviews of the long-term economic viability of both facilities. \n Capital Allocation and Structural Cost Improvement \n  * The company's long-term capital allocation priorities remain investing in advantaged projects to drive cash flow, strengthening the balance sheet and maintaining a reliable dividend. \n  * ExxonMobil’s 2021 capital program remains at $16 billion to $19 billion. If market conditions continue above the company's planning basis, additional cash will be used to accelerate deleveraging. \n  * In addition to $3 billion in structural cost reductions already achieved in 2020, the company is on pace to achieve $3 billion of further structural efficiencies through 2023 for a total of $6 billion relative to 2019. Efforts to identify additional structural savings resulting from the reorganizations completed in 2019 are continuing. \n Reducing Emissions and Advancing Low Carbon Solutions \n  * The company announced the creation of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, a new business to commercialize its extensive low-carbon technology portfolio, with an initial focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS), the process of sequestering industrial emissions and safely storing them permanently underground. CCS is considered one of the critical technologies required to achieve society’s net-zero ambitions and the climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. \n  * In April, ExxonMobil introduced the innovative concept of a multi-industry CCS hub along the Houston Ship Channel and surrounding industrial areas to capture CO2 emissions from area industry, including petrochemical, manufacturing and power generation facilities. The concept would require large-scale collaboration and policy advancements among governments, private industry, and local communities. \n  * ExxonMobil became the first company to file an application with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use new aerial technologies to detect methane emissions at oil and natural gas sites. \n  * ExxonMobil and Porsche are testing advanced biofuels and renewable, lower-carbon eFuels, as part of a new agreement to find pathways toward potential future consumer adoption of fuels that could significantly reduce emissions. \n Ongoing Board Refreshment\n  * During the quarter, ExxonMobil announced the elections of Michael Angelakis, Jeffrey Ubben, and Wan Zulkiflee to its board of directors. With the addition of the new members, the ExxonMobil board increased to 13 directors, 12 of whom are independent. The company has added six new independent directors since 2017 with specific experience in the areas of climate science, asset and risk management, capital allocation, energy and business transition, investor perspectives, and additional energy industry experience. \nExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters during a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on April 30, 2021.

{"id":7053,"text":"Today, ExxonMobil held an employee forum at its campus in Houston. Chairman and CEO Darren Woods discussed the current state of the industry, how the company managed through a difficult period, the leadership role the company intends to play in the energy transition, and his optimism for the future. Mr. Woods’ comments to ExxonMobil’s employees are summarized as follows:\n Unprecedented times\nI'd like to start by simply thanking you. You’ve shown tremendous resilience and professionalism over the past few years as we've dealt with the pandemic. These times have been truly unprecedented for the world, for our industry, and for our company.\nBeyond the pandemic, we've faced global concerns about climate change and tremendous turbulence in politics and society around the world. Today, I hope to convey to you why I'm so excited about the future. We can't forget that with unprecedented times comes unprecedented opportunity.\n Improving conditions\nBusiness conditions are improving as the pandemic's impact continues to subside. Global economies are rebounding as vaccination rates rise and infection rates fall. People are returning to work. Personal and business travel is resuming. \nThe rebound is stressing supplies of oil, gas and chemical products around the world. As a result, prices and margins are rising, improving revenue that we're using to strengthen our balance sheet, fund our capital program and pay the dividend. While the past two years were tough, they laid the groundwork for today's market and helped accelerate improvements in our businesses. Today, we're seeing the benefits of investments we made at the bottom of the commodity cycle, when many of our competitors pulled back.\n Meeting society’s needs\nOur focus, which I’ve been proud to be part of since joining ExxonMobil almost three decades ago, takes advantage of our company’s history, experience and capabilities. It is based on a noble, worthy contribution which we are uniquely suited for, and that is helping advance growth in global prosperity through innovative solutions that meet society’s greatest needs.\n Objectives of our strategy\nTo accomplish this mission, we've set three high-level objectives:\n  * Reliably supply the world with products essential for modern living;\n  * Grow earnings and cash flow faster than our competition; and\n  * Lead industry in helping fulfill society's ambition for a lower carbon future.\n Three strategic priorities\nTo meet these objectives, we focused on three key priorities:\n  * Fully leveraging our corporate competitive advantages;\n  * Delivering industry-leading financial and operating performance; and\n  * Leading industry in hard-to-decarbonize emissions reductions.\n Evolving our operating model\nA first step was better organizing our businesses to improve visibility and accountability across value chains in order to improve decision making, speed, and end-to-end ownership of results. \nThis led to the consolidation of our functional companies and created value chains: Upstream was organized along resource types; Chemicals along global product lines; Downstream along tributary fuels markets and integrated lubricants basestocks with finished products. Now, with the addition of the Low Carbon Solutions unit, we have three fundamental business groups — one to discover, develop and produce hydrocarbons; one to convert them into needed products; and one to manage emissions.\nWe're in a much stronger position now to realize the benefits of the economic recovery, capitalize on market improvements, and capture future opportunities. We're also better positioned to apply our corporate competitive advantages and the outstanding talents of our people.\n Reliably supplying the world\nOur businesses continue to lead the way in supplying the world with the products essential for modern living.\nOur Upstream business continues to improve the portfolio and is on track for the best cash flow performance in the industry by 2025. We've had outstanding success with discoveries in Guyana and increased the total estimated recoverable resource on the Stabroek block to approximately 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels. \nOur Downstream business is steadily improving with a slow return to pre-Covid markets. Our past efforts to increase efficiency are now helping improve our margins as the industry rebounds. We continue to lead the industry with the lowest GHG intensity and are increasing investments in low-emission fuels.\nAnd our Chemicals business is on pace for record earnings this year after contributing $2.3 billion in the second quarter alone. Our strategy to focus on performance products and lead in each product category continues to pay off.\nWe are delivering excellent progress and performance in each of our businesses, and we are stronger today than ever.\n Improving financial position – Growing earnings and cash flow\nAt our Investor Day earlier this year, we provided a roadmap for improved earnings and cash flow to 2025. Our plan called for improved margins, operating expenses, and other factors that could position us to significantly rebound and regain industry-leading financial performance.\nThrough the end of the second-quarter, our earnings and cash flow improvements were well on track. We'll report our third-quarter results next week, and, as indicated in our Sept. 30 8-K filing, we expect the market improvement to impact those results. We're in good shape to meet our 2021 plans, which also keeps us on the path to achieving the goals we laid out at Investor Day.\n Leading in a lower carbon future\nWe seek to be a leader when it comes to helping society achieve its lower-carbon ambitions. We started laying groundwork for this in 2017. We built up our R&D capabilities and expanded external collaborations on technology solutions.\nWe plan to succeed in this area by applying our technology, partnering with stakeholders across the world to scale and operationalize Low Carbon Solutions projects, and advocating for market-based policies that support a lower-carbon world.\nWe are making tremendous progress. The Houston carbon capture and storage (CCS) hub announced in April has gained widespread support. Eleven companies are now coming together to advance large-scale CCS technology in the Houston area, which is one of the most concentrated sources of CO2 in the U.S. These companies account for more than 70% of the emissions in that region, so it's a very important grouping of interested parties that could make a significant difference in that region.\nWe're making solid progress with our European CCS projects, and we're seeing real opportunities for new CCS projects in Asia, which we expect to announce in the near future. \n Advocating for effective policies\nWhile we prefer policymakers adopt a transparent, economy-wide price on carbon in the form of a carbon tax, we recognize it is politically challenged. However, we are seeing growing, positive interest for specific sectoral policies to reduce emissions and make CCS more economic including carbon-intensity based standards for transportation fuels and the power sector.\nBeyond CCS, we've been a leader in advocating for comprehensive federal methane regulations, and we are pleased that policymakers are increasingly making this a key part of their emission-reduction plans.\n The next 135 years\nOver our 135-year history, we’ve always demonstrated a way to evolve and adapt to meet the needs of society, and I've never been more excited about our opportunity to lead and grow. We have the core technology capabilities to discover, produce, convert and manage hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based solutions. \nWe’ve never been more prepared to deliver the products and solutions that society needs for modern living, in addition to supporting the desire for a lower-carbon future.\nI'm proud of the work that all of you have done to overcome the challenges of the past few years. \nWe still have work to do, though we have turned the corner and are on the right track to regain industry-leading performance. As we have done so many times before, we’ve found our path to leadership and created the opportunity for ExxonMobil to thrive for the next 135 years.\nThank you.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2021-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods hosts global employee forum","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"Today, ExxonMobil held an employee forum at its campus in Houston.

The net-zero aspiration applies to Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and builds on ExxonMobil’s 2030 emission-reduction plans, which include net-zero emissions for Permian Basin operations and ongoing investments in lower-emission solutions in which it has extensive experience, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels.\n“ExxonMobil is committed to playing a leading role in the energy transition, and Advancing Climate Solutions articulates our deliberate approach to helping society reach a lower-emissions future,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “We are developing comprehensive roadmaps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our operated assets around the world, and where we are not the operator, we are working with our partners to achieve similar emission-reduction results.” \nThe report provides details of how ExxonMobil’s business strategy is resilient when tested against a range of Paris-aligned net-zero scenarios, including the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2018 Special Report and the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero by 2050 scenario. \nExxonMobil’s Outlook for Energy, which is based on current policy and technology trends, continues to be the basis for the company’s business plans and investment decisions. In the Advancing Climate Solutions report, the company outlines how its short- and medium-term business plans are adjustable to developments in policy and technology and how it uses signposts and leading indicators to evaluate the need for any changes in future years.\nSound government policies will accelerate the deployment of key technologies at the pace and scale required to support a net-zero future. ExxonMobil continues to support an explicit price on carbon to establish market incentives and encourage investments in lower-emissions technologies.\nExxonMobil is also committed to helping customers reduce their greenhouse emissions by investing in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. Bio-based feed and plastic waste streams provide further opportunities for lowering greenhouse gas emissions.\n“As we invest in these important technologies, we will advocate for well-designed, high-impact policies that can accelerate the deployment of market-based, cost-effective solutions,” said Woods. “We believe our strategy is unique among industry and enables us to succeed across multiple scenarios. We will create shareholder value by adjusting investments between our existing low-cost portfolio and new lower-emission business opportunities to match the pace of the energy transition.”\nTo help reach net zero for operated assets by 2050, the company has identified more than 150 potential steps and modifications that can be applied to assets in its upstream, downstream and chemical operations. \nInitial actions already underway prioritize energy efficiency measures, methane mitigation, equipment upgrades and the elimination of venting and routine flaring. Further high-impact reduction opportunities include power and steam co-generation and electrification of operations, using renewable or lower-emission power. The company expects to finalize detailed roadmaps that address approximately 90% of operations-related greenhouse gas emissions by the end of this year, and the remainder will be completed in 2023.\nInitial steps to achieve net zero by 2050 are included in the company’s plans to invest more than $15 billion by 2027 on lower-emission initiatives. Policies further accelerating the development and deployment of lower-emission technologies could provide ExxonMobil with additional investment opportunities.\nAdvancing Climate Solutions - 2022 Progress Report is available online at exxonmobil.com. The report expands on the company’s 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, which are consistent with Paris-aligned pathways, the U.S. and European Union’s Global Methane Pledge and the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. Compared to emission levels in 2016, the time of the Paris Agreement, the 2030 plans include a 20-30% reduction in corporate-wide greenhouse gas intensity, which includes 40-50% reduction in upstream greenhouse gas intensity, 70-80% reduction in corporate-wide methane intensity, and 60-70% reduction in corporate-wide flaring intensity.\nThe 2030 emission-reduction plans are expected to achieve World Bank Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 and reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 30% for the company’s upstream business and 20% for the entire corporation. Similarly, absolute flaring and methane emissions are expected to decrease by 60% and 70%, respectively by 2030. \nExxonMobil has regularly updated emission-reduction plans as technologies and policies have evolved and will continue to do so. When final data is collected and analyzed, the company expects to report it achieved its 2025 emission-reduction plans as of year-end 2021, including a 15-20% reduction in greenhouse gas intensity for its upstream operations, compared to 2016 levels.\nExxonMobil’s strategy is outlined in Advancing Climate Solutions and leverages its advantages in scale, integration, technology and people to build globally competitive businesses that lead industry in earnings and cash flow growth across a broad range of future scenarios.\n\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2022-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil announces ambition for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil today announced its ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions for operated assets by 2050, backed by a comprehensive approach to develop detailed emission-reduction roadmaps for major facilities and assets.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2022\/0118_ExxonMobil-announces-ambition-for-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2050","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":7083,"text":"IRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil said today it is planning a hydrogen production plant and one of the world’s largest carbon capture and storage projects at its integrated refining and petrochemical site at Baytown, Texas, supporting efforts to reduce emissions from company operations and local industry.\n  * Hydrogen would fuel olefins plant, reduce integrated site emissions by up to 30% \n  * Carbon capture project would be one of world’s largest; double company’s industry-leading capacity \n  * Hydrogen and carbon capture capacity to help industry reduce emissions \n“Hydrogen has the potential to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in vital sectors of the economy and create valuable, lower-emissions products that support modern life,” said Joe Blommaert, president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. “By helping to activate new markets for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, this project can play an important part in achieving America’s lower-emissions aspirations.”\nThe proposed hydrogen facility would produce up to 1 billion cubic feet per day of “blue” hydrogen, which is an industry term for hydrogen produced from natural gas and supported by carbon capture and storage. The carbon capture infrastructure for this project would have the capacity to transport and store up to 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year, more than doubling ExxonMobil’s current capacity. \nUsing hydrogen as a fuel at the Baytown olefins plant could reduce the integrated complex’s Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions by up to 30%, supporting ExxonMobil’s ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions from its operated assets by 2050. It also would enable the site to manufacture lower-emissions products for its customers. Access to surplus hydrogen and CO2 storage capacity would be made available to nearby industry.\nThe project would form ExxonMobil’s initial contribution to a broad, cross-industry effort to establish a Houston carbon capture and storage hub with an initial target of about 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030, and 100 million metric tons by 2040. Evaluation and planning for the Baytown project are ongoing and, subject to stakeholder support, regulatory permitting and market conditions, a final investment decision is expected in two to three years.\nExxonMobil has extensive experience with hydrogen and already produces about 1.5 billion cubic feet per day. The company is uniquely positioned to participate in the growing hydrogen market and is evaluating strategic investments to increase the use of this important lower-emissions energy technology.\nEqually important is the company’s more than 30 years of experience capturing and permanently storing CO2. ExxonMobil has cumulatively captured more human-made CO2 than any other company and has an equity share of about one-fifth of the world’s carbon capture and storage capacity, which amounts to about 9 million metric tons per year.\nExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business was established to commercialize low-emission technologies and is focusing on carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels – technologies where the company can leverage its core competencies and competitive advantages. Over the next six years, the company plans to invest more than $15 billion on lower-emission initiatives and could increase investments with advancements in policy and technology.\nSound government policies will accelerate the deployment of key technologies at the pace and scale required to support a societal net-zero future. Predictable, stable, cost-effective policies are necessary to incentivize the development and scalability of a wide range of low-emission technologies, including hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. ExxonMobil continues to support an explicit price on carbon to establish consistent incentives and encourage investments.\nExxonMobil is committed to helping society reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the company’s emissions intensity and developing and deploying emission-reducing technologies and products. Increasing the supply of products with lower life cycle greenhouse gas emissions enables the transition from higher-emissions alternatives.\n\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2022-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil planning hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage at Baytown complex","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil said today it is planning a hydrogen production plant and one of the world’s largest carbon capture and storage projects at its integrated refining and petrochemical site at Baytown, Texas, supporting efforts to reduce emissions from company operations and local industry.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2022\/0301_ExxonMobil-planning-hydrogen-production-carbon-capture-and-storage-at-Baytown-complex","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":7095,"text":"IRVING, Texas – April 29, 2022 – Exxon Mobil Corporation today announced estimated first-quarter 2022 earnings of $5.5 billion, or $1.28 per share assuming dilution. First-quarter results included an unfavorable identified item of $3.4 billion associated with our planned exit from Russia Sakhalin-1, or $0.79 per share assuming dilution. First-quarter capital and exploration expenditures were $4.9 billion. \n  * Earned $5.5 billion in first quarter 2022; generated $14.8 billion of cash flow from operating activities, more than covering capital investment and shareholder distributions \n  * Earnings excluding identified items were $8.8 billion, an increase of more than $6 billion versus the first quarter of 2021, after adjusting for a $3.4 billion after-tax charge related to the company's Russia Sakhalin-1 operation\n  * Announced increase in share repurchase program up to a total of $30 billion through 2023\n  * Achieved first oil at the Liza Phase 2 development in Guyana; Payara FPSO construction approximately five months ahead of schedule with start-up likely before year-end 2023; announced five new discoveries, increasing the estimated recoverable resource base for the Stabroek block to nearly 11 billion oil-equivalent barrels\n  * Progressed significant lower-emission opportunities, including plans for a world-scale blue hydrogen plant supported by one of the world's largest carbon capture and storage projects in Baytown, Texas, and received top certification for methane emission management at Poker Lake in the Permian Basin\n  * Effective April 1, to further capture benefits of technology, scale, and integration, the corporation formed ExxonMobil Product Solutions, combining world-scale Downstream and Chemical businesses, and centralized Technology & Engineering and Operations & Sustainability groups\nOil-equivalent production was 3.7 million barrels per day, down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2021 due to weather-related unscheduled downtime, planned maintenance, lower entitlements associated with higher prices, and divestments. Excluding entitlement effects, government mandates, and divestments, oil-equivalent production was down 2%.  \n  \n“The quarter illustrated the strength of our underlying business and significant progress in further developing our competitively advantaged production portfolio,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “Earnings increased modestly, as strong margin improvement and underlying growth was offset by weather and timing impacts. The absence of these temporary impacts in March provides strong, positive momentum for the second quarter.”\n Financial Highlights\n  * First-quarter earnings of $5.5 billion compared with $8.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding identified items, earnings of $8.8 billion were slightly higher than the prior quarter, as higher industry prices and margins and reduced expenses were largely offset by a temporary reduction in volumes, unfavorable mark-to-market derivative effects, and price timing impacts. \n  * First-quarter cash increased by $4.3 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, as strong cash flow from operations more than funded capital investment, additional debt reduction, and shareholder distributions in the quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $11 billion.\n  * With the balance sheet well within the targeted debt-to-capital range of 20-25%, the company initiated its previously announced $10 billion buyback program, repurchasing shares totaling $2.1 billion during the quarter. The company has increased this program and now expects to repurchase up to a total of $30 billion through 2023.\n  * Effective April 1, to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to better serve our customers, the corporation formed ExxonMobil Product Solutions, combining world-scale Downstream and Chemical businesses, and centralized Technology & Engineering and Operations & Sustainability groups. This new integrated business will be focused on high-value products, improving portfolio value, and leading in sustainability. The new centralized organizations will fully leverage functional expertise and quickly deploy best practices across the globe.\n Leading the Drive to Net Zero\n  * In January, ExxonMobil announced its ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from operated assets by 2050. This ambition applies to Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions and builds on the company’s 2030 emission-reduction plans. \n  * The company reached a final investment decision to expand carbon capture capacity at its facility in LaBarge, Wyoming, adding up to 1.2 million metric tons to the nearly 7 million metric tons already captured at LaBarge each year. \n  * ExxonMobil announced plans for its first world-scale blue hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas. The proposed plant would produce up to 1 billion cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen and include one of the world’s largest carbon capture and storage projects, doubling the company’s industry-leading carbon capture capacity and providing a potential anchor for the ambitious Houston Industrial Hub emissions reduction project.\n  * The company advanced several renewable fuel initiatives, including planned renewable diesel production through an equity investment in Global Clean Energy Holdings. In partnership with Neste, the company also agreed to deliver sustainable aviation fuel to Virgin Atlantic and Singapore Airlines. \n  * Earlier this month, ExxonMobil began selling commercial volumes of certified natural gas after MiQ, an independent validator, certified the company’s assets in the Permian Basin with an \"A\" grade – the highest recognition possible – for its methane and emissions-reduction processes and technology applications. The company plans to expand the certification process to other operations in the United States.\n  * The company recently announced that Dan Ammann has been appointed president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, effective May 1. Ammann previously served as president and CEO of General Motors’ Cruise autonomous vehicle company\n Earnings and volume summary by segment\n  * First-quarter 2022 Upstream earnings of $4.5 billion compared with $6.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding identified items, earnings were $7.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from the previous quarter, primarily due to higher liquids prices and lower expenses, partly offset by lower volumes driven by weather-related impacts, fewer days in the quarter, price entitlement effects, and divestments. Average realizations for crude oil increased 28%. \n  * Oil-equivalent production in the first quarter was 3.7 million barrels per day. Excluding entitlement effects, divestments, and government mandates, oil-equivalent production decreased 2% versus the fourth quarter 2021. Liquids volumes were down 119,000 barrels per day, while natural gas volumes were down 132 million cubic feet per day. By the end of the quarter, production had fully recovered from weather-related impacts.\n  * Relative to the first quarter of 2021, earnings excluding identified items increased $5.2 billion, primarily due to higher industry prices, which were partly offset by lower volumes. Average realizations for crude oil increased 68%, while natural gas realizations increased 137%. Excluding entitlement effects, divestments, and government mandates, oil-equivalent production decreased 2%. Liquids volumes were up slightly, while natural gas volumes were down 721 million cubic feet per day.\n  * The company is discontinuing operations at the Sakhalin-1 venture (“Sakhalin”). As operator of Sakhalin, the company remains focused on the safety of people, protection of the environment, and integrity of operations. In the first quarter the company recorded a charge of $3.4 billion related to its investment in the project, which is reflected as an identified item and mainly impacts the Upstream segment.\n  * The Permian Basin continued to improve efficiency and grow production, reaching production of 560,000 barrels per day at the end of the quarter. The company remains on track to deliver a production increase of 25% this year versus full-year 2021, and to eliminate routine flaring by year end.\n  * In February, the company started production at its second major development offshore Guyana. The successful start-up of the Liza Phase 2 development brought total production capacity to more than 340,000 barrels per day. In early April, ExxonMobil announced it made a final investment decision for the Yellowtail development. Yellowtail will be the company’s fourth and largest development to date in Guyana with production capacity of 250,000 barrels of oil per day. It is expected to begin production in 2025. Additionally, Payara FPSO construction is running approximately five months ahead of schedule with start-up likely before year-end 2023.\n  * ExxonMobil continued to progress its global LNG growth strategy to meet growing worldwide demand for reliable gas supply. Commissioning of the Area 4 Coral South Floating LNG project in Mozambique is underway, with first production expected this year, and the company signed the P’nyang Gas Agreement in Papua New Guinea. Additionally, construction of the Golden Pass liquefaction facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast remains on schedule.\n  * First-quarter 2022 Downstream earnings of $0.3 billion compared with $1.5 billion in fourth quarter 2021. Improved industry fuels refining margins and lower expenses were partially offset by lower basestock margins and lower volumes, driven by higher turnaround activity. Results were also impacted by unfavorable mark-to-market impacts and price timing effects that are expected to reverse or unwind over time.\n  * Global refining margins improved from the fourth quarter despite softening seasonal demand, higher natural gas prices in Europe, and lagging jet demand recovery. By the end of the first quarter, industry margins improved to levels above the 10-year range, with the tight supply \/ demand balance expected to persist. While average basestock margins declined from the prior quarter, pricing in April is catching up to rising feedstock costs.\n  * Refining throughput was lower than in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased planned maintenance activity.\n  * Compared to the first quarter of 2021, earnings excluding identified items increased $0.7 billion, primarily due to higher industry refining margins, the absence of unfavorable one-time impacts, and improved reliability.\n  * The Permian Crude Venture remains on track for phased expansion in 2023 and 2024. The project will significantly expand pipeline capacity to transport Permian crude to both the Baytown and Beaumont, Texas refineries, and includes a 250,000 barrel per day light crude processing expansion at Beaumont. Transport fuels production is expected to increase by nearly 125,000 barrels per day in 2023.\n  * First-quarter 2022 Chemical earnings of $1.4 billion compared with $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter 2021. Excluding identified items, earnings of $1.4 billion in the first quarter 2022 compared with $1.3 billion in the previous quarter. The increase was driven by lower expenses and higher volumes on improved production mix, partly offset by lower margins. \n  * Compared to the first quarter of 2021, earnings excluding identified items were down slightly as increased project and planned maintenance spend offset higher volumes.\n  * While first-quarter global industry chemical margins declined, with bottom-of-cycle conditions in Asia Pacific, ExxonMobil’s advantaged portfolio continued to capture value from its ethane feed advantage to deliver strong results.\n  * The recently completed Corpus Christi Chemical Complex is already delivering positive cash and earnings results, despite still ramping up to full production capacity.\n  * The company is progressing plans to increase its global offer of certified circular polymer with capacity to process up to 500,000 metric tons of plastic waste per year by 2026. ExxonMobil is leveraging existing assets and proprietary advanced recycling technology to increase its capacity to process a wide range of plastic waste. Operations in Baytown will be among North America’s largest advanced plastic waste recycling facilities when its expansion is complete later this year, and will have an initial planned capacity to recycle 30,000 metric tons of plastic waste per year. The company is also evaluating and progressing other opportunities in France, the Netherlands, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada, and Singapore. In the first quarter of 2022, the company announced its first commercial sale of certified circular polymer using its Exxtend™ technology for advanced recycling of plastic waste.\n  * ExxonMobil is growing high-value, performance product capacity with competitively advantaged projects. The company's new polypropylene manufacturing unit in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is expected to start up by year-end 2022. Construction of the new Vistamaxx™ performance polymer and linear alpha olefins (LAO) manufacturing units in Baytown are progressing toward a mid-2023 start-up. ExxonMobil will manufacture 10 high-purity LAO products and market this new offering under the Elevexx™ brand name. LAOs are used in a broad range of applications, including plastic packaging, high-performing engine and industrial oils, surfactants and other specialty chemicals.\n  * Corporate and Financing reported net charges of $0.7 billion in the first quarter 2022, compared with $0.6 billion in the fourth quarter 2021. Excluding an identified items charge of $0.1 billion related to Russia, net charges were essentially flat. \n  * Net charges of $0.7 billion in the first quarter 2022 compared with $0.8 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding identified items, costs declined $0.2 billion, driven by lower pension-related corporate costs. \nExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters during a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on April 29, 2022.

EUR 3.5 billion\nOutlook for 2011\nSustained growth in Asia-Pacific and Africa-Mediterranean Basin and continuing recovery in North America and Europe\nFocus on increasing efficiency, reducing costs, and raising prices in order to offset increasing energy and raw material costs as well as rising inflation\nDebt reduction remains our top priority\nTargeted expansion of cement capacities in growing markets is continued\nHeidelbergCement well-positioned to benefit over-proportionally from a recovery of the global economy\nCost reduction measures successfully continued\nHeidelbergCement ended the 2010 financial year successfully in the face of a challenging global economic environment and gained the edge over its main competitors. This was mainly due to cost-cutting measures implemented at an early stage – in some cases even before outbreak of the crisis. Following the successful completion of the \"Fitness 2009\" programme with savings of more than EUR 550 million, we reached savings of more than EUR 300 million in the reporting year with the follow-up \"FitnessPlus 2010\" programme. The measures undertaken in the last two years to sustainably reduce administration and distribution costs as well as repair expenses in the cement business, the streamlining of our location portfolio, and our purchasing initiatives are reflected in the improved quality of profit and strengthened competitiveness.\n\"In 2010, the HeidelbergCement team successfully demonstrated implementation capabilities and cost efficiency once again\", said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. \"We increased our turnover, operating income, and profit for the financial year in a challenging environment. In addition, HeidelbergCement is one of the few companies in our industry that managed to improve its operating margin overall as well as in the two core business lines of cement and aggregates.\"\nIncreased turnover, operating margin and net profit\nGroup turnover increased by 5.8% to EUR 11,762 million (previous year: 11,117), supported by consistently good performance in the growing markets in Asia and Africa as well as advantageous exchange rate effects. Across the Group, sales volumes for cement and clinker, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete virtually remained constant.\nOperating income before depreciation (OIBD) rose by 6.5% to EUR 2,239 million (previous year: 2,102); operating income increased by 8.6% to EUR 1,430 million (previous year: 1,317). In North America, operating income more than doubled as a result of cost-saving measures and improved margins for cement and aggregates. In Africa, cement sales volumes increased by almost 13% to 5.2 million tonnes and operating income reached a new record. In Asia, operating income before depreciation margin was kept almost constant at 27.5%, a peak value even in comparison with the rest of the industry, thanks to the continuing high level of demand.\nDue to lower financing costs and significantly fewer goodwill impairment than in the previous year, the profit for the financial year more than tripled to EUR 511 million (previous year: 168). Earnings per share improved to EUR 1.83 (previous year: 0.30).\nIn view of the improved business development and the maintained focus on the reduction of net debt, the Managing Board and Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting that the dividend be increased to EUR 0.25 per share (previous year: 0.12).\nFurther improvement in financing structure and credit rating\nIn 2010, HeidelbergCement noticeably improved its financing structure through successful bond issues with a volume of more than EUR 2 billion and the arrangement of a new credit line of EUR 3 billion, comfortably ensuring liquidity until the end of 2013. As a result, it was possible to reduce credit margins by more than 50% and the number of participating financial institutions to 17 core banks. The rating agencies responded to the successful improvement of the financing structure by further upgrading HeidelbergCement’s credit rating.\nThanks to successful cost-saving measures and consistent cash management, HeidelbergCement reduced its net debt by a further EUR 0.3 billion to EUR 8.1 billion.\nAs a result, gearing improved to 62.9% (previous year: 76.5%). The liquidity reserve increased to around EUR 3.5 billion at the end of 2010.\nTargeted expansion of market position in growing markets\nIn 2010, HeidelbergCement was consistent and disciplined in continuing the targeted expansion of its market position in the cement business line in growing markets. Two new cement mills with a total capacity of 1.5 million tonnes were commissioned at the Cirebon plant in Indonesia. In September, HeidelbergCement signed an agreement with Forrest Group and now holds the majority share in its cement activities with a capacity of 500,000 tonnes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In autumn, we also acquired the majority share in CJSC \"Construction Materials\", which operates a modern cement plant with a capacity of 2 million tonnes in the Russian Republic of Bashkortostan, an attractive growth region in the Urals.\nConstruction work on the new Tula cement plant in Russia, with a capacity of 2 million tonnes, proceeded as planned. The start of production, to supply the Moscow market, is scheduled for the end of May 2011. The expansion of capacities at the Górazdze cement plant in Poland is also proceeding as planned, and is set to be completed in 2012.\nA cement mill with a capacity of 0.8 million tonnes is currently being constructed in Bangladesh. In addition, a project was started to expand the capacities in central India by 2.9 million tonnes. The complete expansion programme for growing markets, which started as early as 2008, involves capacity expansions of around 20 million tonnes by 2012. HeidelbergCement is thus creating potential for future growth.\nOutlook for 2011\nHeidelbergCement expects the global economy to continue its recovery, albeit at a somewhat weaker level than in 2010. The growth rates in the emerging countries of Asia and Africa will remain significantly above those of the mature markets in North America and Europe.\nIn the Western and Northern Europe Group area, we generally anticipate further recovery in demand and thus increasing sales volumes for cement and aggregates, which will be primarily driven by strong trends in Scandinavia and Germany. We expect varying trends in the Eastern Europe-Central Asia Group area: Development should remain weak in Hungary and Romania, while demand is set to rise in Poland and Central Asia in particular and, in the second half of 2011, in the Czech Republic. In North America, we anticipate a slight increase in cement and aggregates volumes because of ongoing investments in road construction in the United States and the continuing positive development of the commodity industry in Canada. We expect demand to continue developing positively in the Asia-Pacific and Africa-Mediterranean Basin Group areas.\nOn the cost side, HeidelbergCement anticipates an increase in energy and commodity prices as well as rising inflation, particularly in emerging countries. In the mature markets, we also expect an increase in personnel costs. HeidelbergCement's aim is to offset the rise in costs through cost-saving measures and targeted price increases as well as fuel surcharges in the individual markets.\nOn the basis of these assumptions, the Managing Board has set the objective of further increasing turnover and operating income in 2011.\n\"In view of the slow recovery in the mature markets and the rising costs and inflationary pressure, we are maintaining our focus on cash flow and stable margins in order to reduce our debt and further improve our key financial ratios\", explains Dr. Bernd Scheifele. \"With our \"FOX 2013\" programme launched in January 2011, we are continuing our efforts to consistently reduce costs and increase efficiency. In particular, we want to achieve our aim of making HeidelbergCement not only the largest manufacturer of aggregates in the world, but also the most profitable. At the same time we will continue to invest in a focussed way in cement capacities in growth markets. Thanks to our positioning in attractive markets both in emerging and industrialised countries, and our global market leadership in aggregates, HeidelbergCement is ideally positioned to benefit over-proportionally from the continued recovery of the global economy, supported by growth acceleration in North America.\"\nOverview of the HeidelbergCement Group\nEURm\n2009\n2010\ntotal\nl-f-l*\nProfit and Loss Accounts\n\n\n\n\nTurnover\n11,117\n11,762\n5.8%\n-0.5%\nOIBD\n2,102\n2,239\n6.5%\n-0.3%\nin % of turnover\n18.9%\n19.0%\n\n\nOperating Income\n1,317\n1,430\n8.6%\n0.6%\nNet Profit\n168\n511\n204.7%\n\nEarnings per share (IAS 33)**\n0.30\n1.83\n509.4%\n\nCash flow statement\n\n\n\n\nCash flow from operating activities\n1,164\n1,144\n-1.7%\n\nTotal investments\n-820\n-872\n6.3%\n\nBalance sheet\n\n\n\n\nNet debt***\n8,423\n8,146\n-3.3%\n\nGearing\n76.5%\n62.9%\n\n\n*    At constant scope, exchange rates, and stock level.\n**  Attributable to the parent entity.\n*** Excluding puttable minorities.\n10,070 characters","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2011-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","title":"HeidelbergCement reports Group annual results 2010","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Other","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/heidelbergcement-reports-group-annual-results-2010","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":7119,"text":"HeidelbergCement today celebrates the opening of a modernized kiln line at its Polish cement plant in Górazdze. The expansion of the clinker capacity to 6,000 tonnes per day had already been completed on schedule at the beginning of April and was commissioned shortly thereafter.\n\"Modernising the kiln line No 2 in our Górazdze cement plant has enabled us to successfully complete another project as part of our investment programme in attractive growth markets,\" explains Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. \"By deploying state-of-the-art technology, we reduce specific energy consumption and CO2 emissions per tonne of cement and create the premise for the increased use of alternative fuels. With this capacity expansion, we are able to better meet the increasing demand for building materials in Poland, while continuing to strengthen our position as market leader.\"\nGórazdze is HeidelbergCement's largest, most advanced cement plant in all of Europe. Already in 2003, the kiln line No 1 had been modernized and its clinker capacity extended. The current capacity expansion is realised in two phases. In the first phase, the clinker capacity of kiln line 2 was increased from 3,500 to 6,000 tonnes per day. In the second phase, the construction of a new cement mill is intended to expand the grinding capacity for cement in line with the new clinker capacity. This second phase is scheduled for completion in mid-2012. Once the project is fully implemented, cement capacity will increase by 1.2 million tonnes per year.\nEuroconstruct, the European construction business research group, anticipates in its latest forecast for Poland a rise in cement consumption of 15% and 5% for 2011 and 2012.

Operating margins for the full year declined as sales price increases could not fully offset a significant surge in energy prices. The positive contribution to OI from emission rights declined by about €130 million to less than €10 million in 2011. The reduction was due mainly to two effects: the collapse of prices for emission rights in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the consequential decision to save surplus emission rights for future periods. The “FOX 2013” programme exceeded expectations and resulted in cash savings of €384 million including cost savings of more than €100 million in 2011. In consideration of the demographic development, the company successfully renegotiated several pension schemes in North America and Western Europe in order to reduce balance sheet risks arising from the expected future increase of healthcare and pension costs. These efforts resulted in savings of about €130 million on top of the FOX 2013 program over the last three quarters of 2011.\nFull year 2011 revenue and results were negatively influenced by currency effects, in particular by the weakening of the US dollar compared to the euro. This mainly affected the Group areas North America and Africa-Mediterranean Basin. Adjusted for currency and consolidation effects, full year 2011 Group revenue, OIBD and OI increased by 10.7%, 4.0% and 3.2% respectively.\nSupported by a solid development in all Group areas and a late winter start in Europe and North America, revenue and sales volumes continued to improve in the fourth quarter 2011. Excluding effects from emission rights and pensions, OIBD of the underlying business improved by 19.4% and OIBD margin increased by 0.8 percentage points in the fourth quarter as a consequence of the warm weather and easing energy cost pressure. Currency effects did not play a role for the fourth quarter 2011 revenue and results.\nAt the end of December 2011, the number of employees in HeidelbergCement’s continuing operations was 52,526 (previous year 53,437). The reduction of 911 employees essentially results from two opposing developments: On the one hand, more than 1,200 job cuts were made in the North America Group area, the United Kingdom and some Eastern European countries as a result of overhead efficiency improvement programmes, location optimisations and capacity adjustments. On the other hand, we hired about 400 new employees in growth markets where we installed new capacities, for example in Indonesia and India.\nWestern and Northern Europe\nJanuary - December\nOctober - December\n€m\n2010\n2011\n%\n% l-f-l\n2010\n2011\n%\n% l-f-l\nRevenue\n3,811\n4,318\n13.3%\n13.5%\n906\n1,056\n16.5%\n17.7%\nOperating income before\ndepreciation (OIBD)\n683\n734\n7.4%\n7.0%\n225\n183\n-18.6%\n-19.2%\nin % of turnover\n17.9%\n17.0%\n24.9%\n17.4%\nOperating income\n407\n427\n4.9%\n4.1%\n151\n94\n-37.4%\n-38.1%\nSales volumes\nCement\/clinker\/GGBS (Mt)\n19.7\n22.1\n12.4%\n12.4%\n4.7\n5.5\n16.2%\n16.2%\nAggregates (Mt)\n68.8\n79.1\n14.9%\n14.9%\n16.1\n19.2\n19.3%\n19.3%\nRmc (Mm³)\n11.7\n13.8\n17.8%\n17.6%\n2.8\n3.4\n21.5%\n21.3%\nAsphalt (Mt)\n3.4\n3.6\n7.6%\n7.6%\n0.8\n0.8\n6.7%\n6.7%\nThe business development in Western and Northern Europe in 2011 was supported by the mild weather conditions at the beginning and at the end of the year that led to an extended construction season.

Fourth quarter sales volumes and revenue increased strongly due to the late winter start.

During 2011, HeidelbergCement benefited from its balanced geographical exposure in North America, especially from the demand driven by the commodity industry in Western Canada and Texas. Asphalt volumes, however, declined for the full year and in the fourth quarter compared to the same periods in 2010. Results improved significantly due to the strong focus on cost cutting and efficiency improvements and the change in pension schemes in the fourth quarter.

{"id":7137,"text":"on Thursday, 3 May 2012, at the Kongresshaus Stadthalle Heidelberg, Germany\nIn his speech to about 450 shareholders, CEO Dr. Bernd Scheifele offered a look back at HeidelbergCement’s successful development in 2011. Despite a massive surge in energy costs, HeidelbergCement was among the few companies in the building materials sector to achieve increases in revenue, operating income, and net income. The improvements were attributable to HeidelbergCement’s excellent geographical positioning in local growth markets, as well as the successful implementation of the programme for financial and operational excellence “FOX 2013”. Continued systematic debt reduction resulted in stronger key financial figures, which led to an upgrading of the company’s credit rating by the rating agencies. During the crisis, HeidelbergCement carried on investing in attractive growth markets. In 2011 alone, the company expanded cement production capacity by a further 3 million tonnes in Poland and Russia.\nThe shareholder structure of HeidelbergCement continued to diversify over the past 12 months along with an increase in the proportion of North American and European value-oriented investors in the shareholder pool. The shareprice of HeidelbergCement recovered significantly but lagged the development of the DAX after a phase of weakness in the middle of 2011, when the European debt crisis and uncertainties about the recovery of the US weighed on the stock. Since the start of 2012, HeidelbergCement shares outperformed the peers and indices.\nOutlook for 2012 confirmed\nDr. Scheifele also reported on the results and developments in the recently ended first quarter 2012, reconfirming HeidelbergCement’s outlook for the remainder of the year as presented at the press conference on 2011 results in March. HeidelbergCement will continue its efforts to increase efficiency and reduce debt, while maintaining its strategy of targeted investment in cement capacities in growth markets. Thanks to the company's global presence in attractive markets throughout both the emerging and industrialised world, and as market leader in aggregates, HeidelbergCement is ideally positioned to benefit over-proportionally from a further global economic recovery.\nDividend increased by 40%\nThe Annual General Meeting has approved the proposal of the administration to increase the dividend by 40% to €0.35 with a substantial majority of 99.97%. “The increase of the dividend is a clear signal to our retail shareholders that we are committed to reach an industry standard payout ratio of between 30% and 35% in the mid-term,” explained Dr. Bernd Scheifele.\nOf the company’s € 562.5 million in subscribed share capital, 73.41% were represented.\n2,760 characters","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2012-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","title":"HeidelbergCement – Annual General Meeting","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Other","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/heidelbergcement-annual-general-meeting-0","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":7143,"text":"HeidelbergCement has commissioned a new cement mill with an annual capacity of 1 million tonnes at its Tema cement grinding plant in Ghana. Capital expenditure amounted to €16 million. With around 300,000 inhabitants, Tema is one of the most important coastal cities of the country, located 25 kilometers to the east of the capital of Accra.\nHeidelbergCement’s subsidiary, Ghacem Ltd., operates two cement grinding plants in the coastal cities of Tema and Takoradi. With the commissioning of the new mill, the company increased its cement grinding capacity to 3.7 million tonnes.\n“The commissioning of the new cement mill is part of our strategy of focusing on expanding our clinker and cement capacities in attractive growth markets. In addition to Asia and Eastern Europe, these include, in particular, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa,” said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “Ghana’s stable democracy and dynamic economic growth lead to a quickly rising demand for high quality cement and other building materials for infrastructure and residential construction. We will continue our growth strategy in sub-Saharan Africa: in September, we already announced the construction of a new clinker plant and a new cement grinding installation in the neighbouring country of Togo.”\nAccording to the prognosis of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Ghana’s economy is expected to grow by more than 8% in 2012. In addition to gold, timber and cocoa, the traditional main exports of the country, oil production off Ghana’s coast has become another important driving force for the economy.\nAbout HeidelbergCement\nHeidelbergCement is one of the largest building materials manufacturers worldwide, as the global market leader in aggregates and with leading positions in cement, concrete, and other downstream activities.

{"id":7149,"text":"In Ghana, HeidelbergCement is constructing a new cement mill with an annual capacity of 0.8 million tonnes at its grinding plant in the port city of Takoradi. The investment of US$ 30 million also includes the construction of a new clinker and a new cement silo as well as the installation of new cement bag packing and dispatch facilities. In November 2012, HeidelbergCement inaugurated a new 1 million tonnes cement mill at its grinding plant in Tema some 25 km east of the capital city of Accra.\n“The construction of the new cement mill in Ghana is another project in the context of our strategy of expanding our clinker and cement capacities in growth markets. In particular the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have a very high growth potential due to their early stage of industrialisation and rich natural resources”, said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “We recently increased the mill capacity at our Tema plant. Together, the two cement grinding plants in Ghana constitute our largest capacities in West Africa. With the new mill, we want to expand our capacities in line with the rapidly growing cement consumption and maintain our dominant position in this key market.”\nBy setting up adequate capacity to better serve the growing market in the important coastal cities as well as throughout Ghana, HeidelbergCement aims at maintaining its competitive edge in West Africa.\nCommissioning of the new mill is scheduled for late 2014.

While construction activity in Europe and large parts of North America was hindered due to the long, cold winter, our building material deliveries benefited from the sustained growth in demand in our Asian and African markets as well as from the continued economic recovery in North America. Sales volumes were also negatively affected by the reduced number of working days compared with the previous year.\nThe Group’s cement and clinker sales volumes remained relatively stable with a slight decline of 0.7% to 18.1 million tonnes (previous year: 18.2). The growth in sales volumes in the North America, Asia-Pacific, and Africa-Mediterranean Basin Group areas almost completely compensated for losses in the European markets. Despite poor weather in eastern and northern USA, North America overall still achieved solid growth in sales volumes. In the Asia-Pacific and Africa-Mediterranean Basin Group areas, the expansion of our cement capacities in India and the high increase in volumes in Ghana and Togo contributed, among others, to a slight increase in sales volumes. Cement sales volumes in the Western and Northern Europe Group area declined significantly due to the poor weather conditions. The harsh winter, coupled with difficult market conditions in some countries, also resulted in a loss of sales volumes in Eastern Europe-Central Asia.\nAggregates sales volumes decreased Group wide by 10.8% to 41.9 million tonnes (previous year: 47.0). Ready-mixed concrete deliveries fell by 2.1% to 7.9 million cubic metres (previous year: 8.1). Asphalt sales volumes decreased by 8.6% to 1.3 million tonnes (previous year: 1.4).\nRevenue almost stable – operating income improved\nGroup revenue for the period from January to March 2013 decreased slightly by 1.4% to €2,761 million (previous year: 2,799). The prolonged winter put a strain on sales volumes and revenue primarily in the Western and Northern Europe and Eastern Europe-Central Asia Group areas. In operational terms, the other Group areas achieved an increase in revenue of more than 5%. Successful price increases in cement and aggregates in all Group areas had a positive impact on revenue development. The impact of changes in the consolidation scope and exchange rate effects almost completely offset each other.\nOperating income before depreciation rose by 3.5% to €219 million (previous year: 212). Operating income increased by 35% to €16 million (previous year: 12). Successful price increases and decreasing energy costs were decisive for the improvement of operating income compared to the previous year.\n“The improved operating income in Q1, despite declining sales volumes and revenue, shows that we are on the right track”, says Chairman of the Managing Board Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “The measures we introduced for improving the margins are showing results. The efficiency improvement programmes are going according to plan and we were already able to implement price increases in many of our markets.”\nThe additional ordinary result fell by €22 million to €-32 million (previous year: -10). This relates primarily to the addition to provisions totalling €32 million owing to the ruling of the Federal Court of Justice in the German antitrust proceedings. The financial result improved by €3 million to €-145 million (previous year: -148).\nProfit before tax from continuing operations fell by €15 million to €-162 million (previous year: -147). Expenses relating to taxes on income increased by €19 million to €23 million (previous year: 4). As in the previous year, the figure was primarily characterised by non-capitalised deferred taxes on losses carried forward in North America. Profit after tax from continuing operations amounts to €-184 million (previous year: -151).\nOverall, the loss for the period amounts to €-184 million (previous year: -159). The profit attributable to non-controlling interests rose by €2 million to €50 million (previous year: 48). The Group share therefore amounts to €-235 million (previous year: -208).\nAt the end of Q1 2013, the number of employees at HeidelbergCement stood at 52,613 (previous year: 53,230). The decrease of 617 employees essentially results from two opposing developments: on the one hand, around 1,800 jobs were cut in the North America Group area, in the United Kingdom, in Spain, and some Eastern European countries in connection with efficiency increases in sales and administration, location optimisations, and capacity adjustments. On the other hand, we have hired more than 900 new employees in growing markets such as India and Indonesia. In addition, the number of our employees in Australia has grown by around 250 following the increase in the stake in the proportionately consolidated cement company Cement Australia.\n“FOX 2013” programme further progressing according to plan\nThe three-year programme for financial and operational excellence (“FOX 2013”) led to an improvement in cash flow of €39 million in Q1 2013. It is thus well on the way to achieving the targeted improvement of €1,010 million over the three-year horizon. In 2011 and 2012, the programme already generated cash effective savings totalling €767 million.\nNet debt significantly reduced compared to previous year\nDue to its successful cost saving measures and consistent cash management, HeidelbergCement was able to further improve free cash flow and reduce net debt by €0.6 billion to €7.79 billion compared to the end of Q1 2012. Gearing improved to 56.2% (previous year: 63.5%).\nTargeted expansion of market position in growth markets\nIn mid-February, HeidelbergCement completed the expansion of its cement and clinker capacities in Central India. The plants, which have an annual capacity of 2.9 million tonnes, are located in the Damoh district (Narsingarh and Imlai) in the federal state of Madhya Pradesh and in Jhansi in the federal state of Uttar Pradesh. Test runs had already been conducted successfully between November 2012 and January 2013.\nAt the end of March, HeidelbergCement increased its stake in Australia’s largest cement producer, Cement Australia, from 25% to 50%, doubling the available annual cement capacity to more than 2 million tonnes. In the second half of 2013, a new grinding plant with an annual capacity of 1.1 million tonnes is scheduled to start operation in Port Kembla. The increase in the stake in Cement Australia is a good example for HeidelbergCement’s strategy of low risk bolt-on acquisitions. Following this strategy, HeidelbergCement also increased its stake in the Russian cement producer, CJSC Construction Materials in Bashkortostan, from 51% to 100% and in the British building materials producer, Midland Quarry Products (MQP), from 50% to 100%. The share of non-controlling interests in the Group share of profit decreases thereby in favour of HeidelbergCement shareholders.\nThe planned expansion of cement capacity thereby rose to just under 7 million tonnes in 2013.\nOutlook confirmed for 2013\nIn its latest forecast, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) slightly lowered the growth rates for the global economy and some key countries such as the USA, China, and Germany, but continues to expect a gentle acceleration in the global economy compared with the previous year. However, this remains subject to the industrial countries in North America and Europe continuing unabatedly with their efforts to resolve the debt crisis and to achieve budgetary consolidation. The euro debt crisis, the high level of debt in the USA, and the armed conflicts in the Middle East continue to pose political risks to the development of the global economy. As a result of automatic budget cuts, the North American Portland Cement Association reduced its estimate for US cement consumption in 2013 from 8.1% to 6.1% at the end of April; yet it simultaneously increased its estimates for the following years so that even a slight increase is projected for 2015.\nIn North America, HeidelbergCement expects a continuing economic recovery and consequently a further increasing demand for building materials, especially from residential construction and the raw materials industry. In Europe and Central Asia, HeidelbergCement anticipates a divided development: while markets in Germany, Northern Europe, Russia, and Central Asia should remain stable or continue growing, a weak development of the economy and demand for building materials is expected in all other regions. In Asia and Africa, the company expects a sustained positive demand.\nIn terms of costs, the company anticipates a light to moderate increase in the cost base for raw materials and personnel. Regarding the energy costs, the Group expects an overall stable development in 2013 following the slight decline in energy costs in the first quarter 2013 compared to the previous year. The objective is still to recover the margin loss that has arisen from the massively increasing energy costs in recent years. As a result, price increases have top priority. In 2012, the Group therefore started the two sales excellence programmes “PERFORM” for the cement business in the USA and Europe as well as “CLIMB Commercial” for the aggregates business line, in order to achieve margin improvements totalling €350 million by 2015. The Group wants to realise a further €240 million of cash savings in 2013 as part of the “FOX 2013” programme, in comparison with the base year 2010. Furthermore, HeidelbergCement is pursuing the “LEO” programme for optimising supply chains, which has the goal of achieving cost reductions of €150 million over the coming years.\nOn the basis of these assumptions, the Managing Board is continuing with the objective of further increasing revenue and operating income in 2013 and significantly improving profit before tax.\n“Business development in the first quarter has strengthened our conviction in our prospects for the 2013 financial year,” says Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “We will continue to focus our efforts on increasing sales prices. For this purpose, we will implement the sales excellence programmes “PERFORM” and “CLIMB Commercial” with high priority. At the same time, we will continue to drive our efforts to lower costs and increase efficiency with the “FOX 2013” and “LEO” programmes. The consistent reduction of net debt is still a top priority for us, with the aim of improving the relevant financial key figures to an investment grade level. We will also remain on course with our successful strategy of targeted investments to expand cement capacity in emerging countries. With our global market leadership in aggregates and our advantageous geographical positioning in attractive markets, we will do our utmost to benefit over-proportionally from the continued economic growth.”\n13,076 characters","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2013-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"HeidelbergCement reports Q1 2013 results","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Other","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/heidelbergcement-reports-q1-2013-results","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

The North America Group area experienced the strongest growth in sales volumes, followed by Asia-Pacific and Africa-Mediterranean Basin. Cement sales volumes in Western and Northern Europe as well as Eastern Europe-Central Asia increased also slightly. Deliveries in the United Kingdom were more than 10% above those of the previous year due to the recovery in private residential construction and current infrastructure projects in the area of London. Following the drop in demand in the first half of the year, cement sales volumes stabilised in Eastern Europe. Adjusted for consolidation effects, cement sales volumes increased by 2.9%. Deliveries of aggregates rose significantly by 6.3% to 73.1 million tonnes (previous year: 68.8); adjusted for consolidation effects, the increase amounted to 5.5%. Especially in North America, aggregates sales volumes increased considerably. Deliveries of ready-mixed concrete rose by 4.5% to 11.0 million cubic metres (previous year: 10.5). Key growth drivers were the markets in Asia, especially in Indonesia. Asphalt sales volumes fell slightly by 0.6% to 2.8 million tonnes (previous year: 2.9).\nIn the first nine months of the year, cement and clinker sales volumes increased slightly by 1.0% to 67.7 million tonnes (previous year: 67.0). While deliveries of aggregates fell marginally by 1.2% to 180.6 million tonnes (previous year: 182.9), deliveries of ready-mixed concrete rose by 2.6% to 29.8 million cubic metres (previous year: 29.0); asphalt sales volumes declined by 2.5% to 6.4 million tonnes (previous year: 6.5).\nDevelopment of revenue and results\nGroup revenue remained almost stable at €3.891 million (previous year: 3.944). The increase in sales volumes and successful cement and aggregates price increases in principal markets could not fully offset negative currency effects in the Group areas. Excluding exchange rate and consolidation effects, revenue grew by 4.9%, with all Group areas recording an increase, except for Eastern Europe-Central Asia.\nOperating income before depreciation (OIBD) declined by 7.0% to €811 million (previous year: 872), operating income decreased by 6.8% to €603 million (previous year: 647). Although the increase in sales volumes, successful price increases, and declining energy and raw material costs contributed positively to the development in results, they could not fully compensate for negative currency effects. Excluding exchange rate and consolidation effects as well as a €48 million gain from the sale of a depleted quarry in the third quarter 2012, operating income before depreciation increased by 4.2% and operating income by 7.1%.\n“The positive development of sales volumes, prices, and costs shows, that we continue to be operationally well on track”, says Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board. “Thanks to the cost savings measures implemented at an early stage, we see a significant increase in results in North America and the United Kingdom. On Group level, however, we had to face growing headwind in revenue and operating income in the third quarter, due to the significant strengthening of the euro. Our efficiency improvement programmes continue to progress according to plan.”\nAdditional ordinary result of the third quarter improved by €295.3 million to €236.3 million (previous year: -59.0), mainly due to a non-cash effective profit from the unwinding of an obsolete corporate structure of Hanson in the UK. Furthermore, the same quarter of the previous year included a loss of €43.8 million from the disposal of business units in North America. Financial result rose significantly by €48.0 million to €-135.0 million (previous year: -183.0) mainly due to a decrease in net interest expenses by 14% to €123 million.\nProfit before tax from continuing operations improved considerably by 70.5% to €720.5 million (previous year: 422.5). Tax expenses in the third quarter of 2013 amounted to €92.4 million (previous year: 98.7). Net income from continuing operations rose to €628.1 million (previous year: 323.8).\nOverall, profit for the period rose notably by 97.6% to €627.4 million (previous year: 317.6) in the third quarter. The share of profit attributable to non-controlling interests fell by €16.3 million to €47.7 million (previous year: 64.0). This was mainly the result of currency effects and the increase in the stake in the Russian cement producer CJSC Construction Materials in the Republic of Bashkortostan from 51% to 100%. Group share of profit increased by 128.6% to €579.8 million (previous year: 253.6). Accordingly, earnings per share improved considerably to €3.10 (previous year: 1.36).\nIn the first nine months of the year, Group revenue remained almost at previous year’s level with €10,450 million (previous year: 10,525). Operating income before depreciation (OIBD) fell by 0.9% to €1,764 million (previous year: 1,779); operating income declined also slightly by 0.7% to €1,143 million (previous year: 1,152). Profit for the first nine months of the financial year rose significantly to €912 million (previous year: 403). Profit attributable to non-controlling interests decreased to €157 million (previous year: 177). Group share of profit, therefore, improved considerably to €755 million (previous year: 226).\nAt the end of September 2013, the number of employees at HeidelbergCement stood at 53,621 (previous year: 53,729). The decrease of 108 employees results essentially from two opposing developments: on the one hand, the number of jobs in the North America Group area, in Benelux, Spain, and some Eastern European countries declined by more than 1,100 as a result of efficiency improvements in sales and administration, location optimisations, and capacity adjustments. On the other hand, more than 700 new employees were hired in growth markets such as Indonesia and central Asia. Furthermore, the number of employees rose by around 300 due to the increase of our stake in the proportionately consolidated cement company Cement Australia and the acquisition of the remaining 50% in the hitherto proportionately consolidated Midland Quarry Products, United Kingdom.\nNet debt increased slightly compared to the previous year – financing structure improved\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2013, HeidelbergCement’s net debt amounted to €8.0 billion, which is €0.2 billion higher compared with the end of the third quarter of 2012. Thereby, gearing rose to 61.5% (previous year: 55.0%).\nDevelopment of net debt was influenced by the complete payment of €161 million for the cartel fine confirmed by the Federal Court of Justice in Germany in April, negative currency effects, and higher investments in the first half of the year compared with the previous year. The higher amount of investments in the first half of 2013 results from the increase in HeidelbergCement’s stake in Cement Australia and in the British building materials producer Midland Quarry Products. In the first nine months of 2013, cash flow investments amounted to €930.1 million (previous year: 511.2). The overall restrictive investment policy remains unchanged.\nHeidelbergCement further improved its financing structure. In October, HeidelbergCement issued a 7 year Eurobond with an issuance volume of €300 million and a yield to maturity of 3.375%. Compared with the last Eurobond issued in spring 2012, the terms have improved once again despite longer maturity. This is a clear proof of the improved credit quality of HeidelbergCement.\n“FOX 2013” programme already achieves full-year target after 9 months – margin improvement programmes “PERFORM”, “CLIMB Commercial”, and “LEO” progress according to plan\nAfter only nine months, the three-year programme for financial and operational excellence “FOX 2013” exceeded the 2013 savings target of €240 million and generated cash savings of €253 million. The reduction of working capital as well as savings achieved in procurement and the “OPEX” project exceeded expectations. The projects that were launched to improve margins – “PERFORM” for cement, “CLIMB Commercial” for aggregates, and “LEO” for reduction of logistics costs – continue to progress according to plan.\nOutlook for 2013\nIn its latest forecast, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has further reduced growth rates for the world economy. The on-going slower growth in China and the possible ending of the extremely relaxed monetary policy in the USA have negatively impacted the growth potential and exchange rates of emerging countries. For 2013, the IMF expects a growth rate of 2.9% only, compared to 3.2% in the previous year. However, this remains subject to the industrial countries in North America and Europe continuing unabatedly with their efforts to resolve the debt crisis and to achieve budgetary consolidation. The euro debt crisis, the high level of debt in the USA, and the armed conflicts in the Middle East continue to pose political risks to the development of the world economy.\nIn North America, HeidelbergCement continues to expect an on-going economic recovery and consequently a further increasing demand for building materials, especially from residential construction and the raw materials industry. A three-layered economic development is anticipated in Europe and central Asia: The markets in Germany, Northern Europe, and the United Kingdom should continue to develop positively. Markets in central Asia should stabilise, and in Benelux and Eastern Europe a continuing weak development of the economy and demand for building materials is anticipated. In Asia and Africa, HeidelbergCement expects no changes in the sustained growth in demand.\nIn terms of costs, the Group anticipates a light to moderate increase in the cost base for raw materials and personnel. For energy costs, HeidelbergCement expects a stable or slightly declining development overall for 2013, following the slight decline in the first nine months of the year. The objective remains to recover the margin loss that has arisen from the massively increasing energy costs in recent years. Price increases have top priority. To this end, the Group started two sales excellence programmes in 2012 – “PERFORM” for the cement business in the USA and Europe as well as “CLIMB Commercial” for the aggregates business line – with the objective of achieving a margin improvement of €350 million by 2015. The Group wants to realise a further €240 million of cash-relevant savings in 2013 as part of the “FOX 2013” programme, in comparison with the base year 2010. Furthermore, HeidelbergCement is continuing the “LEO” programme for optimising supply chains, which should reduce costs by €150 million over the coming years.\nOn the basis of these assumptions, the Managing Board is continuing with the objective of further increasing revenue and operating income in 2013 and significantly improving profit before tax.\nBased on the increase in the stake of Cement Australia, Midland Quarry Products, and CJSC “Construction Materials”, the Group will probably exceed its target of €1.1 billion for cash flow investments and reach a level of about €1.35 billion. HeidelbergCement nevertheless sticks to the original target and will continue with its disciplined investment policy.\n“Despite the growing headwind, we confirm our earnings outlook for 2013, even though reaching our targets is much more challenging than assumed at the end of the first half of the year”, says Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “In view of the weakening economic development and exchange rates in some emerging countries, we will continue unabatedly with our measures to improve margins. We will maintain our focus on increasing sales prices. For this purpose, we will intensify our implementation efforts for the “PERFORM” and “CLIMB Commercial” sales excellence programmes. At the same time, we will continue to drive our efforts to lower costs and increase efficiency with the “FOX 2013” and “LEO” programmes. Deleveraging with the aim to improve the decisive key financial ratios is still a top priority for us, in order to qualify for an investment grade rating. We will also remain on course with our successful strategy of targeted investments to expand cement capacities in emerging countries. With our global market leadership in the aggregates business line and our advantageous geographical positioning in attractive markets, we will do all we can to benefit over-proportionally from the continued economic growth.”\n14,721 characters","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2013-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"HeidelbergCement reports Q3 2013 results","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Other","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/heidelbergcement-reports-q3-2013-results","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":7185,"text":"### HeidelbergCement inaugurates new greenfield clinker and cement capacities in Togo and Burkina Faso  HeidelbergCement has inaugurated the new greenfield Scantogo clinker plant in Togo on 6 March 2015. The new US$ 250 million plant possesses an annual capacity of 1.5 million tonnes (5,000 tpd) and is located at Tabligbo, some 80 kilometres north east of the capital city Lomé. More than 2,000 guests attended the ceremony, among them the president of the Republic of Togo, the president of the National Assembly and the German ambassador in Togo. With the Scantogo investment, HeidelbergCement has become the largest German foreign investor in Togo.   A day earlier, on 5 March 2015, HeidelbergCement has furthermore inaugurated the new Cimburkina cement grinding plant in Burkina Faso, the neighbouring country of Togo to the north. The new US$ 50 million plant has an annual capacity of 0.8 million tonnes and is located near the capital city Ouagadougou. More than 400 guests attended the ceremony, including the minister of Industry and Commerce, the representative of the minister of Economy and Finance, the local representative of the Emperor of the Mossi people as well as a number of traditional chiefs and religious leaders.  “The new greenfield facilities are part of our strategy of expanding our cement capacities in growth markets. In addition to Asia these include, in particular, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa”, said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement who attended both inauguration ceremonies together with Mr. Daniel Gauthier, member of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement responsible for Africa, and the General Management of the HeidelbergCement Africa team, including the respective country managers. “The new clinker plant in Togo will greatly improve our competitiveness by enabling us to replace expensive clinker imports by local sourcing. The clinker from Togo will also be used in our new grinding plant close to Ouagadougou to produce cement for the local construction industry in Burkina Faso. Our new plants are strengthening our position in both countries as well as in the whole region.”  Scantogo will supply clinker to HeidelbergCement’s West African cement grinding mills in Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, and Ghana, partly replacing expensive clinker that has previously been imported from overseas, and thereby strengthen HeidelbergCement’s competitiveness in the region.  HeidelbergCement has been present in Togo since 1984 with the Cimtogo grinder in Lomé. Scantogo represents a major industrial development and directly employs some 200 people. The new operation will also create around 1,000 additional jobs locally. It will significantly contribute to domestic cement production and local infrastructure development. Exports from Scantogo will provide Togo with important currency inflows. HeidelbergCement has also recently started to build a 0.25 million tonnes cement capacity greenfield grinder in the Kara region in the northern part of Togo, which will be ready by 2017.  IFC, a branch of the World Bank, is partially funding Scantogo. The Togolese Government will hold 10% of Scantogo.  Cimburkina will stimulate the improvement of local infrastructure and housing by providing quality cement, and is expected to create around 100 jobs at the plant, and more than 300 indirect jobs.  With the inauguration of the new capacities, HeidelbergCement further extends its footprint in the growing markets of sub-Saharan Africa.

{"id":7191,"text":"Four strategic levers to drive earnings growth: significant operating leverage, cost leadership, vertical integration and a superior geographic footprint\nAmbition to achieve more than €17 billion in Group revenue and more than €4 billion in Operating EBITDA by 2019\nTarget solid investment grade as foundation for future returns\nShift capital allocation towards enhanced shareholder returns and disciplined growth in attractive markets\nCommitment to progressive dividends with a targeted pay-out ratio of 40% to 45% by the end of 2019 – potential additional return of cash through share buy-backs\nIn advance of today’s Capital Markets Day 2015 in London, HeidelbergCement announces new mid-term strategic priorities and financial targets for the five-year period until 2019. On the back of the positive outlook for the current fiscal year and a strong asset base, the Group aims to increase Group revenue from €12.6 billion in 2014 to more than €17 billion by 2019. Over the same period, Operating EBITDA is expected to grow from €2.3 billion to more than €4 billion.\nFollowing the successful deleveraging over the past years, the company also intends to further shift its priorities for capital allocation towards disciplined growth and increased shareholder returns. The Group projects cumulative free cash flow of about €8.8 billion for the period from 2015 to 2019. Of this amount, it intends to invest approximately €2.5 billion in organic growth while using approximately €1 billion to keep leverage in a range which supports a solid investment grade rating. More than €2 billion shall be allocated to shareholders through progressive dividend payments. In this context, HeidelbergCement intends to raise the pay-out ratio from 29% for fiscal year 2014 to between 40% and 45% for fiscal year 2019. Further available cash may be allocated to acquisitions or returned to shareholders through share buy-backs.\nDr Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Management Board, commented: “We have delivered on our strategy of growth and deleveraging which we announced in 2010. As we enter the next phase of our corporate development, HeidelbergCement is in an excellent position to capitalise on its considerable strengths and drive future growth and value creation. We have a compelling strategy in place which clearly differentiates us from our competitors and we remain the industry leader in business excellence and cost efficiency. Over the next five years, we intend to achieve continuous growth and significantly increase our free cash flow with the clear commitment to building shareholder value.”\nDr Lorenz Näger, Chief Financial Officer, added: “We are focused on being the first major building materials company to earn our cost of capital in 2015. On this solid financial base, we will allocate our strong free cash flow to carefully selected growth initiatives and increasing shareholder returns. We intend to significantly raise our dividend pay-out ratio and offer our shareholders progressive dividends based on affordability and sustainability.”\nFour strategic levers to enhance growth and profitability\nHeidelbergCement further improved its position as a global leader in heavy building materials during the past five years. The Group achieved leading market positions in Cement, Aggregates, Ready Mix and Asphalt and expanded its geographic footprint in mature and fast growing emerging markets. With its highly efficient business organisation and successfully implemented margin improvement programmes, the Group has established itself as the cost leader within the industry.\nOn this strong foundation, HeidelbergCement is setting out for the next phase of accelerated growth. Its mid-term strategic priorities will focus on four levers: benefit from significant operating leverage, sustain cost leadership, leverage operational strength through vertical integration and integrated management of the businesses, and capitalise on growth opportunities in attractive markets to further expand the geographic footprint.\nAs important markets improve, the Group anticipates to benefit from its considerable operating leverage which should drive further earnings growth. In order to bolster its position as an industry leader in cost management, HeidelbergCement will continue to realise efficiency improvements through the enhanced digitalisation of the value chain and by promoting a culture of entrepreneurship across the entire Group.\nIn addition, HeidelbergCement will deepen vertical integration in urban centres as a key driver of future growth and value creation. The Group has already made considerable progress in implementing an integrated management model across its asset base. By further integrating processes across business lines and sites, HeidelbergCement will be able to leverage its operational excellence on a larger scale. This will result in better customer service and improved delivery capabilities and will support a shift towards customer solutions and cross-selling. It will also enable a further reduction of operating costs. Going forward, the Group intends to further expand and develop vertically integrated positions in urban centres around the globe.\nHeidelbergCement is furthermore optimally positioned to capture the growth potential in important mature and emerging markets. The Group will carefully deploy capital for selected growth opportunities in existing geographies and expand its footprint to new markets through a targeted and disciplined M&A approach.\nCapital Markets Day 2015\nHeidelbergCement will present further information on its mid-term strategic priorities and financial targets at its Capital Markets Day scheduled for today, 1.30pm GMT \/ 2.30pm CET, in London.\nAudio webcast of the event\nAbout HeidelbergCement\nHeidelbergCement is the global market leader in aggregates and a prominent player in the fields of cement, concrete, and other downstream activities, making it one of the world’s leading integrated manufacturers of building materials.

{"id":7197,"text":"Disposal of lime business in Germany completed\nBridge financing for the acquisition of Italcementi successfully syndicated\nFinancing volume of bridge financing reduced by €600 million\nHeidelbergCement has taken further important steps to strengthen its financing. On 31 August , HeidelbergCement completed the disposal of its lime business in Germany to the Belgian Lhoist Group. Both companies agreed not to disclose any details about the transaction. In addition, HeidelbergCement successfully syndicated the bridge financing for the acquisition of Italcementi. All core banks of HeidelbergCement participated in equal shares in the syndication of the credit line originally provided by Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley. At the same time, the financing volume could be reduced by €600 million from €4.4 billion to €3.8 billion, because the initial risk of a mandatory offer to minority shareholders in Morocco could be excluded.\n“The disposal of the lime business in Germany and the syndication of the bridge loan with a reduced volume are futher important steps on our way to strengthen our financing,” said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “With the syndication of the bridge loan, we have laid a solid funding base for the acquisition of Italcementi. The fact that all our core banks participated in the syndication is a clear proof of the high reputation of HeidelbergCement in the banking sector and the strength of our relationships with the banks and clearly reflects that the banks are convinced of the transaction.”\nHeidelbergCement used to operate two lime plants in Germany – Walhalla Kalkwerk in Regensburg and Kalkwerk Istein close to Basel. Both lime plants were modernized in the past years with state of the art kiln technology and generated a turnover of about € 45 million in 2014 with approximately 180 employees.\nThe following banks participated in the syndication of the bridge loan: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Bayern LB, BNP Paribas, Citibank, Commerzbank, Danske Bank A\/S, Deutsche Bank, Helaba, ING Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, LBBW, Mediobanca, Nordea, RBI, RBS, SEB, Standard Chartered, Svenska Handelsbanken, and Morgan Stanley.","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2015-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Further important steps taken to strengthen financing ","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Other","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/further-important-steps-taken-to-strengthen-financing","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
