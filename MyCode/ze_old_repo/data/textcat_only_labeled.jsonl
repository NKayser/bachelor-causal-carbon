Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “ArcelorMittal’s generally excellent performance in 2008 was overshadowed by the considerable slowdown in the world economy in the last quarter of the year. Our scale, strength and market leadership, however, allowed us to swiftly and decisively implement a number of operational and financial measures to adapt to the changing environment. These measures have already started to yield results. The reduction of net debt is particularly pleasing, enabled by our ability to continue to generate strong free cash flow.

However, he will continue with ArcelorMittal in an advisory capacity, so that the company's Brazilian operations will continue to benefit from his skills and experience.  Mr. Campos began his tenure with the organization in 1992, leaving the Brazilian mining firm CVRD to join Companhia Siderúrgica de Tubarão (CST) as it was being privatized. He became President and CEO of CST in 1997. He has held the same positions at ArcelorMittal Brasil since its formation – through the integration of CST, Vega do Sul, and BelgoMineira – in 2005. He has been a member of the Brazilian Steel Institute (IBS) and was its President from 2002 to 2005. He has also been a member of the Brazilian Metallurgy and Materials Society since 1972 and is on the Board of Directors of the Brazilian Business Council for Sustainable Development (CEBDS).  Benjamin Baptista, who has been appointed to the position of Vice President and CEO, Flat Carbon South America (FCSA), will succeed José Armando Campos.  Mr. Baptista currently serves as Vice President, Commercial for FCSA. An engineer, he has had a broad range of executive experience since joining the company in 1983, including extensive project and operational responsibilities. His knowledge and experience managing commercial coordination and critical customer relationships for FCSA will contribute substantially to the realization of ArcelorMittal's strategic growth objectives in this important region.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, Chief Financial Officer and member of ArcelorMittal's Group Management Board responsible for Flat Carbon Americas said:  \"José Armando has provided exceptional service to ArcelorMittal and to the employees of FCSA. Based in large part on his personal integrity and commitment to people development, FCSA has become one of the most well respected operations in our Group as well as in the entire Brazilian economy. His leadership during the integration of Arcelor and Mittal was invaluable, and we are pleased that our Brazilian operations will continue to benefit from his counsel. We are also very confident and excited that Benjamin will provide the executive leadership and vision required to carry FCSA through this challenging economic period and on to the next generation of success for ArcelorMittal's operations in the region.\"","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2009-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Announces Leadership Transition for Flat Carbon South America Operations","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announces that as part of his original retirement plan, José Armando Campos has stepped down.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-announces-leadership-transition\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

The company will maintain all equipment during the suspension period to ensure that production can be re-started as swiftly as possible when market conditions improve.  The EWC and ArcelorMittal agreed that there will now be strong and transparent social dialogue about the production suspensions at local site level with the relevant Works Councils and employees.  Commenting, Bernard Fontana, Executive Vice President and Management Committee Member of ArcelorMittal with responsibility for Human Resources, said: \"We had a constructive meeting today with the European Works Council and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their co-operation during what is a very challenging period for the global economy. The steel industry, like many global companies, is suffering the very real repercussions of the global economic slowdown. We have moved swiftly to adapt ourselves to the new economic reality but despite the good progress made market conditions remain harsh. It is therefore only sensible to continue with our plans to suspend and optimize production at our sites on a temporary basis, until we are confident that real demand is beginning to improve. Our primary goal is to proceed in a socially responsible way with respect for those affected. These decisions are not taken lightly, but by taking the right initiatives now we are protecting the company and its employees for the longer term.\"  Jacques Laplanche, Secretary of the European Works Council, added: \"It is essential to deal with this exceptional economic environment by having a strong and consistent social dialogue at all levels including EMF, EWC, countries and sites and to ensure that all affected sites are well maintained to safeguard ArcelorMittal's production capability in Europe\".","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2009-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Joint statement from ArcelorMittal and its European Works Council regarding meeting held today in Luxembourg","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal met today with its European Works Council to provide an update on the temporary suspension of production at sites in Europe.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/joint-statement-from-arcelormittal-and-its-european-works\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

In connection with the offering, the Company intends to grant the underwriters a 30 day option to purchase up to an additional $75 million of convertible senior notes.

Total aggregate proceeds from the offerings are approximately $3.5 billion (exclusive of any proceeds attributable to the underwriters' possible exercise of their over-allotment options described below) or $4 billion (assuming full exercise of those options), in each case before deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions.  The Company has agreed to sell 125,143,915 common shares at a public offering price of 17.10 EUR (US$22.77 at a $\/EUR conversion rate of 1.3318) per common share. In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 15,738,719 common shares in the 30 day period following the date hereof.

Interest on the convertible senior notes will be paid semi-annually at a rate of 5 percent per year, and the convertible senior notes will mature on May 15, 2014, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The convertible senior notes will be convertible at the holder's option into shares of ArcelorMittal common stock (or, at the option of ArcelorMittal, into cash or a combination of cash or common stock) at an initial conversion ratio of 33.1675 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $30.15 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. This initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 32.4 percent relative to the public offering price of ArcelorMittal's common stock of 17.10 EUR (US$22.77 at a $\/EUR conversion rate of 1.3318) per share in the common stock offering.

{"id":6032,"text":"ArcelorMittal is working on advanced technologies to redefine the steel making process and contribute positively to the global challenge of climate change. It is using its expertise in steel to find ways to operate more efficiently, to develop pioneering new processes and more sustainable practices, and to work in partnership with its customers and suppliers to help them achieve their environmental goals.  Some of ArcelorMittal's operations are already outstanding examples of industry leading best practice in social and environmental performance. Indeed some, like those in Brazil, have a long and proud track record in this area, and are regularly cited as role models for others. Likewise, its plants in Europe and the US have set the pace for the whole steel industry in carbon emission reductions. Reaching these high standards across the business is a priority for ArcelorMittal.  Other highlights in this year's report include:    * Communities – Habitat for Humanity: In 2008, the ArcelorMittal Foundation set up a partnership with Habitat for Humanity that involved financial support, volunteering opportunities for our employees and a design scheme to use our expertise in steel construction to develop new, sustainable, low-cost approaches to building family homes. The first steel frame homes are being constructed in Romania, using light steel frames designed by our R&D team in Liege, Belgium. The goal is to build more durable homes using steel frames and roofing in countries that are prone to natural disasters, as well as training communities to adopt safer construction practices.    * South Africa Schools: Formed a partnership with the South African Department of Education to build ten schools throughout the country using new steel technology. The first school, Mamelodi Primary, is scheduled for completion by the end of 2009. This investment not only ensures that we have a pool of skilled resources for our own operations, but also contributes towards addressing the skills shortage in the country in general.    * Workplace:   * $20 million dollars invested by ArcelorMittal University in training programmes for employees   * 17,751 participants from 23 countries in its academies and induction programmes, representing almost 40,000 training days   * Group lost time injury frequency rate was reduced to 2.3 per million hours worked (from 3.3 in 2007).","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2009-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal releases 2008 Corporate Responsibility Report \"How will we achieve Safe Sustainable Steel?\"","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal is pleased to announce the publication of its 'Corporate Responsibility Report 2008: How will we achieve safe sustainable steel?'

Through a series of video episodes and a blog section, the season looks at how the company was affected by the unexpected economic crisis, how it adapted to this unprecedented shock and how as the recovery progresses the focus it puts on maintaining its leadership position.  Exploring the values and its commitment to its stakeholders, the Web TV takes a transparent approach to tell the story of the global economic downturn and its consequences on the business.  The new season starts with an episode that encapsulates the essence of the last 18 months, from the sudden downturn to the realization of what this meant for the company. With insightful and personal reflections from members of the senior management including the Chairman and CEO, Lakshmi Mittal, as well as from shop floor employees, the first episode highlights the various ways that the company was affected and the challenges it faced.  Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, said: \"2009 was a very difficult year for us as well as for many other companies. In order to adapt to a very challenging environment we had to look hard at how the company operated and make whatever changes were necessary in order to be resilient in the face of the worst economic downturn since the Second World War. Whilst we would all have preferred not to have lived through that period, nevertheless the business has learned some valuable lessons which will make us a stronger company in the long-term. The Web TV is a perfect platform to explore and explain this by sharing our experiences in a very transparent way with all our stakeholders.\"  Nicola Davidson, Vice President Corporate Communications, said: \"People often focus on the financial impact that an economic crisis has on a company, but there are many other aspects of the company that can be affected, for example relationships with customers and suppliers, and the motivation and morale of employees. We wanted to utilize the Web TV to examine all these aspects in closer detail, as well as exploring the decisions that helped us through the crisis, such as cost competitiveness, and the projects and opportunities that will lead us back to growth and maintain our competitive edge.\"  Launched in 2007, the two previous award winning series had pioneered the concept of Web TVs and given stakeholders a transparent view inside ArcelorMittal. With almost 3 million unique visitors in the two previous seasons, the ArcelorMittal Web TV has become an essential tool in the group's internal and external communication.  In parallel to the episodes, the site has been developed as a rich community-oriented space where visitors are encouraged to get involved with the content, react to the stories, and take active part in '2010: The Road to Recovery'.

With operations in 60 countries and over 250,000 employees around the world, ArcelorMittal is perfectly positioned to become a sponsor of the world's greatest international sporting event.  Speaking at today's unveiling of The ArcelorMittal Orbit at London's City Hall, Lakshmi Mittal, in the presence of Mayor Boris Johnson and Anish Kapoor, revealed the design chosen to act as an iconic and permanent symbol of the 2012 games. Moreover, it will embody both the artistic and functional versatility of steel as a construction material.  Lakshmi Mittal commented: \"The Olympic Games are one of the few truly iconic global events. I was immediately excited by the prospect of ArcelorMittal becoming involved because ArcelorMittal is a global company with operations in more than 60 countries. And as someone who lives in this great city, I remember the great excitement felt when it was announced that London had been selected to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. We set out to create a transformational piece of art that will be an iconic symbol for the Olympics and also a new landmark that will endure long after the Games themselves. Everyone at ArcelorMittal is delighted with the outcome of the ArcelorMittal Orbit. London will have a bold, beautiful and magnificent sculpture that also showcases the great versatility of steel.\"  ArcelorMittal, led by Chairman and CEO Lakshmi Mittal, will fund £16 million of the £19.1 million project, with the outstanding £3.1 million provided by the London Development Agency. As such, the sculpture not only represents a significant cultural investment – the largest single artwork ever commissioned for any Olympiad – but will also make a significant financial contribution to the long-term regeneration of East London.  The ArcelorMittal Orbit, the largest artistic commission in the world, will harness state-of-the-art engineering and architectural techniques. Constructed with steel provided by ArcelorMittal, the sculpture will consist of a continuous looping lattice of tubular steel and offer unparalleled view of the entire Olympic Park and London's skyline from a special viewing platform.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2010-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal confirmed as sponsor for London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"The Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal, today unveiled the artist and design chosen to create a spectacular new visitor attraction in the Olympic Park.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-confirmed-as-sponsor-for-london-2012\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

While Baffinland considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may prove to be incorrect. Forward looking-information is subject to certain factors, including risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is currently expected. These factors include risks inherent in the exploration for and development of mineral deposits, risks relating to changes in iron ore prices and changes in the worldwide demand for and supply of iron ore, uncertainties inherent in the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, risks relating to the remoteness of the Mary River Property including access and supply risks, reliance on key personnel, construction and operational risks inherent in the conduct of mining activities, regulatory risks, including risks relating to the acquisition of necessary licenses and permits, financing, capitalization and liquidity risks, including the risk that the financing required to fund all currently planned exploration and related activities may not be available on satisfactory terms, or at all, environmental risks and insurance risks. You should not place undue importance on forward-looking information and should not rely upon this information as of any other date.

{"id":6075,"text":"Based on this assessment, the Board has decided to proceed with the spin-off of the stainless steel business which it believes will maximise value for shareholders. Subject to shareholder approval, shares in the stainless steel business will be distributed to shareholders in the first quarter of 2011. Shareholders will receive one stainless steel business share for every twenty ArcelorMittal shares held on the record date. Stainless steel business shares will be listed on Euronext Paris, Amsterdam and in Luxembourg. In the United States, they will trade on the over-the-counter market in the form of NY Registry Shares. A prospectus describing the stainless steel business and transaction will be published later this month.  The spinoff is expected to result in a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $ 800 million as the stainless steel business will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 applicable to assets held for distribution. The final impairment charge will be assessed by ArcelorMittal and reviewed by its auditors as at year end. Currency fluctuations and change in working capital are the main factors that between now and year end may influence the final impairment amount. No such impairment charge would be expected had the stainless steel segment remained in the scope of activities of ArcelorMittal.  Following the spin-off, the stainless steel business will have approximately $1bn of net financial debt which will comprise a combination of existing ArcelorMittal debt transferring with the stainless steel business and new debt raised by this business. As a result, the transaction is expected to be broadly neutral to ArcelorMittal's net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio.

{"id":6081,"text":"The ArcelorMittal Offer is made for 100% of Baffinland's shares as compared to Nunavut's offer, which is a coercive partial bid for only 50.1% of Baffinland's common shares including those shares already owned by Nunavut.  The current offer by Nunavut is coercive because it forces Baffinland shareholders to decide whether to accept or reject such offer without knowing the price at which the shares not taken up would trade should the current offer by Nunavut be completed. Nunavut's offer leaves shareholders with the prospect of being left with thinly traded minority common shares that would unlikely reflect the full value of Baffinland's assets. In addition, Nunavut's offer provides Baffinland's shareholders with no certainty as to how many shares will be taken-up due to the pro rationing of tendered shares. Further, the fact that Nunavut already owns approximately 10.3% of the common shares means it is effectively bidding for only approximately 39.8%.  Assuming all of Baffinland's common shares, other than those locked-up with ArcelorMittal and those owned by Nunavut, are tendered to Nunavut's offer, Baffinland's shareholders would receive C$1.35 in cash for approximately 62% of their holdings and would end up continuing to hold the remaining 38% of their tendered shares. For Baffinland shareholders to realize the equivalent value offered by the C$1.25 ArcelorMittal Offer, the remaining minority common shares held by tendering shareholders would have to trade at or above C$1.09 per share, versus an unaffected price for Baffinland's common shares of C$0.56 prior to the initial unsolicited offer by Nunavut on 22 September 2010. The economic value of the coercive partial offer by Nunavut is substantially less than the ArcelorMittal Offer and is highly uncertain as it is dependent on an unspecified royalty structure and project development plan.  Under the current offer by Nunavut, Baffinland shareholders face continued execution and financing risk with the potential for significant equity dilution. If the Nunavut offer were successful, these risks could materially and adversely affect the value of the remaining minority common shares.  Baffinland has agreed to adopt a new shareholder rights plan in order to protect Baffinland's shareholders from being coerced into tendering into Nunavut's inferior partial offer and in order to guard against tactics by Nunavut that seek to coerce shareholders. Adopting a new rights plan ensures that Baffinland shareholders can take advantage of the superior ArcelorMittal Offer.  The increased break fee payable under the ArcelorMittal Offer reflects Baffinland's board of directors' support for the certainty and value that the ArcelorMittal Offer provides to Baffinland shareholders. ArcelorMittal's Offer for all common shares represents an increase of $0.15 per share, or almost $60 million, more than its original bid.  ArcelorMittal has received all of the required regulatory approvals for its offer and is uniquely positioned to provide the technical expertise and financial capacity to evaluate, manage and overcome the infrastructure challenges associated with the Mary River project, a project vital to Baffinland's future success.

{"id":6082,"text":"In light of this, the OSC had requested that ArcelorMittal and Nunavut extend their bids until mid January pending such hearing. Given that ArcelorMittal is not prepared to hold its offer open beyond December 29, ArcelorMittal has requested, in accordance with the Support Agreement between ArcelorMittal and Baffinland, that Baffinland waive the Rights Plan by no later than 4:59 p.m. (Toronto time) on December 29, 2010. Unless waived with respect to all bids prior to that time by Baffinland, the OSC has ordered that the Rights Plan be cease traded at 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on December 29, 2010. Accordingly, the expiry time of ArcelorMittal's offer remains 11:59 pm (Toronto time) on December 29, 2010.  ArcelorMittal's offer for 100% of Baffinland's shares is clearly superior to Nunavut's coercive partial offer for less than half of Baffinland's outstanding shares. Therefore, ArcelorMittal believes that its bid will be successful on December 29, 2010 and has no intention of extending its offer beyond that date.  Shareholders should be aware that if ArcelorMittal's minimum tender condition is not met and its offer expires, the Support Agreement between ArcelorMittal and Baffinland would be terminated and Resource Capital Funds (RCF) would then be released from its Lock-Up Agreement with ArcelorMittal, leaving RCF free to tender to Nunavut's partial offer. In such case, if all outstanding Baffinland shares were to be tendered to Nunavut's offer, the pro rata take-up under that offer would be reduced from 62% to 44% of shares tendered and Baffinland's remaining minority shares would need to trade at $1.17 per share after completion of that offer in order for the value of Nunavut's offer to equal the $1.25 value of ArcelorMittal's offer for all outstanding shares, more than double the $0.56 per share unaffected price of Baffinland's shares prior to the announcement of Nunavut's unsolicited offer in September 2010.  ArcelorMittal has received all required regulatory approvals for its offer and is in a position to take up all shares tendered if its 50% plus one common share minimum tender condition is met on December 29, 2010. ArcelorMittal has improved its offer by almost $60 million since its original offer on November 12, 2010, whereas Nunavut's current partial offer provides $83 million less cash to Baffinland shareholders than Nunavut's original $0.80 per share offer.

{"id":6085,"text":"This re-affirmation follows a settlement agreement between Nunavut and Staff of the Ontario Securities Commission (\"OSC\"), the major terms of which were that Nunavut must either extend the expiry date of its bid for a minimum of 10 days without offering the exchange rights and warrants previously proposed by Nunavut, or amend their offer to provide for the issuance of the exchange rights while also extending the offer for a minimum 10 days. Under no circumstances can Nunavut on January 10, 2011 take up any shares tendered to its offer.  Nunavut's agreement with the OSC allowed it to avoid a public hearing to examine the adequacy of its disclosure and its compliance with securities laws, and the risk of a cease trade order against its bid.  \"Nunavut's partial offer is highly conditional and discretionary, and continues to be so,\" Peter Kukielski, Head of Mining and Member of the Group Management Board at ArcelorMittal, said. \"Nunavut provides Baffinland shareholders no certainty as to what Nunavut is offering under its bid. Nunavut's coercive partial offer will leave shareholders with the prospect of holding thinly traded shares subject to further financing and execution risks. It is also important for Baffinland shareholders to understand that the Nunavut offer does not currently include any exchange rights or warrants, and will not unless and until such time as the Nunavut offer is amended and the timing extended, both of which are uncertain.\"  He added that the Baffinland shares would be subject to further dilution under the Nunavut offer, as a result of the proposed issuance of warrants, if implemented, and as Nunavut sought financing to move the project forward\".  As disclosed by Baffinland earlier today, estimated capital costs under the Road Haulage feasibility study currently being finalized are expected to be higher than research analyst estimates, creating further uncertainty about the likely trading value of Baffinland shares not taken up under the Nunavut partial offer.  From the perspective of Baffinland shareholders, the ArcelorMittal offer for 100% of Baffinland shares eliminates all uncertainty with respect to future financing and costs of the Mary River project, dilution arising from the financing of the project, and the future trading value of Baffinland shares.

{"id":6108,"text":"World's leading steel company reiterates commitment to energy-efficiency and safety and wellbeing in the workplace and beyond as economic recovery gathers pace  Issued as part of the company's Annual General Meeting at its Luxembourg headquarters, this report underlines ArcelorMittal's commitment to improving its safety and sustainability performance in line with growing product demand from the recovering global economy. The report has been externally assured by Bureau Veritas and adheres to the Global Reporting Initiative G3 guidelines and United Nations Global Compact principles.  Key highlights of this year's CR report include the launch of a dedicated Human Rights Policy, which is implemented across its operations as well as through its supply chain.  ArcelorMittal's investments in energy-saving and environmental projects in 2010 increased to $347 million, from $224 million the previous year. Furthermore, ArcelorMittal's commitment to research and development, spending $322 million in 2010, is helping it to reach its goal of reducing emissions by 8% or 170kg per tonne of steel produced by 2020, against a 2007 baseline.  ArcelorMittal's health and safety performance also improved, with the Group's Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) falling from 1.9 per million hours worked in 2009 to 1.8 per million hours in 2010. Moving forward, the company is firmly committed to its 'Journey to Zero', and has set a new ambitious Group-wide target to reduce LTIFR to 1.0 per million hours worked by 2013.  Other key Corporate Responsibility highlights for the 2010 financial year included the following:    * Supply chain: In 2010, ArcelorMittal published its Code for Responsible Sourcing, which sets out the minimum environmental and social standards its suppliers must meet, and how the company will work actively with them to achieve this.   * ArcelorMittal University: Training at the ArcelorMittal University increased by 28% to over 403,000 hours.   * Community investment: The ArcelorMittal Foundation invested $37.7 million across more than 585 local community projects in 2010. This included a $1 million donation in cash and in kind to support the earthquake relief work in Haiti, offering assistance in new housing projects.   * Anti-corruption training: 94 per cent of employees in relevant roles were trained on ArcelorMittal's new anti-corruption guidelines in 2010.   * Community engagement: In addition to adhering to ArcelorMittal's Community Engagement Standard, many units have begun to produce local corporate responsibility reports to strengthen disclosure with stakeholders, this includes Argentina, Brazil, India, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the USA.   * External recognition: ArcelorMittal has been a member of the FTSE4Good index since 2007 and in 2010 the company was accepted into the Dow Jones Sustainability World and Europe indices, evidencing the progress made in areas of governance, social and environmental management. It was also named as a SAM &#xu2;018Sector Mover' – an award given to the company that achieved the biggest proportional improvement in its sustainability performance compared with the previous year.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2011-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes 2010 Corporate Responsibility Report: Safe Sustainable Steel","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal, the world's leading steel company, today published its Corporate Responsibility (CR) report for the 2010 financial year: Safe Sustainable Steel.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-publishes-2010-corporate-responsibility\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6123,"text":"ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel and mining company, today commenced commercial iron ore production from its mining operations in Liberia. A launch event was held in Buchanan which was attended by Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Minister of Lands, Mines and Energy, Mr. Roosevelt G. Jayjay, Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, as well as ArcelorMittal's senior management team.  The launch of commercial mining operations represents an important milestone in the recovery of Liberia's economy, which was devastated by 14 years of civil war.ArcelorMittal first entered this market in 2005, realising the potential of the country's rich mineral resources to facilitate repair of the country's industrial and social infrastructure.  Working in partnership with the Liberian government and civil society, ArcelorMittal has demonstrated how the needs of industry can be reconciled with those of a developing economy, delivering mutual benefit to all stakeholders. From the outset, the company has focused on creating a sustainable operation that can ultimately be run by Liberian nationals, ensuring maximum employment opportunities for local citizens.  \"It gives me great pleasure to announce the formal launch of our mining operations in Liberia,\" comments Lakshmi N. Mittal.\"Quite apart from the significant impact this will have on the local economy, I'm also proud that our approach to this exciting new market represents best practice in terms of responsible business.\"  Developing a sustainable mining operation in Liberia has necessitated finding solutions to a number of challenges. To date, ArcelorMittal invested 800 million USD in repairing roads and infrastructure, whilst also supporting the need for education and healthcare amongst the local population, through projects including the reconstruction of a 240 km railway, port, hospital and school facilities – developments that will serve local communities as well as enabling the iron ore mining operation to operate efficiently. By 2012, ArcelorMittal aims to ship four million tonnes of iron ore from Liberia each year. A first test shipment successfully took place last week.  Another key element of the company's investment in Liberia was the launch, in January 2010, of the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Forum.Created in partnership with the German international development body Deutsche Gesellschaft Fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the role of the CR Forum is to promote effective corporate citizenship and good business practice amongst both domestic Liberian companies and other multinationals planning to invest in the country. The creation of this body, which is also chaired by ArcelorMittal, has received credit from campaign groups including the UK-based corporate watchdog Global Witness, underlining the credibility and transparency of the company's strategy.  As part of its wider commitment to minimising the industry's environmental impact, ArcelorMittal also commissioned a team of local and international experts and NGOs to conduct a full biodiversity study in Liberia's Nimba mountain range. It has been the most comprehensive environmental study ever undertaken in Liberia, ensuring that iron ore mining operations do not come at an unacceptable cost to the local ecosystem.  ArcelorMittal also became a member of Multi-Stakeholders Steering Group of the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2009, having supported this initiative since 2007.  Attending the launch ceremony for ArcelorMittal's mining operation, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf commented:\"ArcelorMittal was one of the first major companies to enter Liberia after decades of instability. Their coming – for which Liberians will always be grateful – signalled a major vote of confidence by investors in the leadership and future of our country. ArcelorMittal honored its 2006 commitment to launch mining operations by the third quarter of 2011. This is a promise the company has kept, despite the global financial crisis that threatened to bring the project to a halt. ArcelorMittal's work has improved the lives of many Liberians today and for many years to come. We welcome this excellent partnership. We look forward to an even brighter and prosperous future for ArcelorMittal and for Liberia.\"    * For further information on our operations in Liberia and live updates please visit: http:\/\/allafrica.com\/infocenter\/ArcelorMittal\/news-and-media\/press-releases\/   * For high resolution images of our Liberia operations please click here","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2011-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal formally commences iron ore production in Liberia","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Important milestone in Liberia's economic recovery achieved","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-formally-commences-iron-ore-production\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6128,"text":"ArcelorMittal will remain a shareholder in PEAMCoal until the termination arrangements are completed which is expected to be in approximately 90 days' time. In taking this decision, ArcelorMittal has determined that it would no longer be appropriate to allocate substantial capital to the acquisition of a non-controlling, minority business interest. This is in accordance with the rights that ArcelorMittal originally negotiated with Peabody at the time the Co-operation and Contribution Agreement was concluded.  Given the unanticipated level of acceptances into the offer, ArcelorMittal believes that it is more appropriate to focus its capital elsewhere in its business.

{"id":6131,"text":"The increased all cash offer represents a premium of approximately 27% to ArcelorMittal's original Offer price of C$1.10 per Common Share, and a premium of 150% to the trading price of the Common Shares prior to Nunavut's original unsolicited offer in September 2010.  Peter Kukielski, Head of Mining and Member of the Group Management Board of ArcelorMittal said: \"ArcelorMittal's increased Offer of C$1.40 per share for all Common Shares provides demonstrably superior value and certainty for Baffinland shareholders, compared to Nunavut Iron Ore Acquisition Inc.'s revised coercive partial offer. Our Offer ensures shareholders receive 100% cash for all of their shares, rather than cash for just some shares and diluted value for the shares not taken up under the Nunavut offer.\"  If Nunavut Iron Ore Acquisition Inc.'s (\"Nunavut\") revised offer were successful, Baffinland shareholders would face the prospect of being left with thinly traded minority Common Shares that would be unlikely to reflect the full value of Baffinland's assets. Furthermore, if Nunavut's partial offer was successful and Baffinland were to issue the approximately 157.4 million warrants contemplated in their partial offer, a substantial overhang would exist, which would lead to significant equity dilution, both of which would likely have a negative impact on the trading value of the remaining minority held Common Shares of Baffinland.  Since Nunavut already owns approximately 10.5% of the Common Shares, it is effectively bidding for only approximately 49.5%, or approximately 55.4% of the 89.5% of Common Shares it does not currently own.  In order for the value of Nunavut's revised coercive partial offer to equal the C$1.40 per Common Share offered by ArcelorMittal's increased Offer (assuming a 55.4% pro rata take-up under Nunavut's offer), the remaining minority held Common Shares would need to trade at C$1.18 per share (which assumes a warrant value of C$0.23 per full warrant using Nunavut's volatility and risk free rate assumptions as set out in its December 29 announcement), which is more than double the C$0.56 trading value of the Common Shares prior to Nunavut's original offer for all of the Common Shares in September 2010. Assuming Common Shares tendered to the Offer under lock-up agreements with ArcelorMittal do not tender and there is a 76.6% take-up under the Nunavut revised coercive partial offer, the remaining minority held Common Shares would need to trade at C$1.06 per share for the value of Nunavut's revised coercive partial offer to equal the C$1.40 per Common Share offered by ArcelorMittal's increased Offer.  Nunavut's revised coercive partial offer leaves Baffinland shareholders uncertain about:    * How many of their shares will be taken-up due to the pro rationing of tendered shares;    * the price at which shares not taken up by Nunavut would trade should the current partial offer by Nunavut be completed;   * the timing of any amendment to its offer to provide for exchange rights;   * whether warrants would be issued in the future and the value such warrants represent; and   * Nunavut's project development plan for Baffinland.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2011-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Increases Its Offer Price for all Common Shares of Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation to C$1.40 per Common Share","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announced that it has increased its offer (the \"Offer\") for all outstanding common shares (\"Common Shares\") of Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation (\"Baffinland\") and all outstanding common share purchase warrants issued pursuant to a warrant indenture dated 31 January 2007 (the \"2007 Warrants\") to C$1.40 per Common Share.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-increases-its-offer-price-for-all-common\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6136,"text":"Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “The progressive recovery that we have been experiencing was impacted in the second half of the year by the growing uncertainty over the economic situation in Europe, which particularly affected sentiment and performance in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, against this backdrop ArcelorMittal delivered an improved underlying performance compared with 2010 and met our expectation of a higher EBITDA in the second half compared with the previous year. The Company continues to benefit from its diverse geographic presence and growing mining business, which delivered on its targets to increase iron-ore and coal production by 10% and 20% respectively. I must also remark on our health and safety performance, which showed an improvement in the injury frequency rate to 1.2x in the fourth quarter.  Looking ahead to 2012, the situation in Europe remains a live concern. Despite the continued uncertainty in this market, however, we are seeing an improvement in sentiment compared with the fourth quarter. Steel shipment volumes for the first six months are expected to be similar to the first half of 2011 and we are again targeting increased production from our mining business.”  ### Fourth quarter 2011 earnings analyst conference call  Additionally, ArcelorMittal management will host a conference call for members of the investment community to discuss the fourth quarter 2011 financial performance at:  ###   Date | New York | London | Luxembourg   ---|---|---|---   Tuesday February 7, 2012 | 9.30am | 2.30pm | 3.30pm   The dial in numbers: |  |    Location | Dial in numbers | Replay numbers | Participant   UK local: | +44 (0)207 970 0006 | +44 (0)20 7111 1244 | 696578#   UK toll free | 0800 169 3059 |  | 696578#   USA local: | +1 215 599 1757 | +1 347 366 9565 | 696578#   USA free phone: | 1800 814 6417 |  | 696578#   A replay of the conference call will be available for one week by dialing   Language | English   +49 (0) 1805 2043 089 | Access code | 421168# |       The conference call will include a brief question and answer session with senior management.

{"id":6149,"text":"“ArcelorMittal’s status as the world’s leading steel and mining company is a source of intense pride, both personally and for our employees,” comments Lakshmi N. Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal. “With industry leadership comes responsibility, however – responsibility to our employees and contractors; to our shareholders and customers; to the environment; and, not least, to the communities in which we operate. I hope the 2011 CR Report demonstrates that we are delivering against this responsibility by making tangible progress against key targets, particularly in the all-important area of health and safety,” he adds.   Other key elements of ArcelorMittal’s CR performance in 2011 include commissioning Deloitte to provide assurance over the report and conduct the first-ever external verification of the Group’s CO2 footprint, providing a benchmark against which to measure emissions performance in future years. 98 per cent of the company’s steel operations have now been certified against the ISO 14001 international standard for environmental management systems, up from 95 per cent in 2010.  This year also saw ArcelorMittal’s CR reporting improve to level B+ in the application of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3.1 guidelines, due to increased disclosures.   2011 is also the year that ArcelorMittal Orbit rose from the ground at the heart of the London 2012 Olympic Park. This striking 114.5 metre ‘living sculpture’ that will be formally unveiled this week, is a demonstration of the strength and versatility of steel. The steel is sourced from ArcelorMittal plants from around the world with 57 per cent coming from recycled sources. Steel is the world’s most recycled and recyclable material and, as the world’s largest steel producer, in 2011 ArcelorMittal saved approximately 40 million tonnes of CO2 through the re-use of more than 30 million tonnes of scrap.

The joint venture is expected to become operational in the first half of 2014.  In addition ArcelorMittal could potentially recalibrate its share-holding in Hunan Valin Steel. The two companies have finalized a share swap arrangement based upon a Put Option mechanism, which enables ArcelorMittal to exercise the Put Options granted by Valin Group over the next two years. Under this arrangement, ArcelorMittal could sell up to 19.9% of the equity (600 million shares) it holds in Hunan Valin Steel to Valin Group. The exercise period of the Put Options is equally spaced with a gap of 6 months and linked to the key development milestones of VAMA. Following the exercise of the Put Options, ArcelorMittal would retain a 10.07% shareholding in Valin Steel as a long term strategic cooperation.  Mr Sudhir Maheshwari, ArcelorMittal’s Group Management Board member responsible for China, said: “We have agreed with Valin Group to recalibrate our shareholdings in Valin Steel to focus on China’s fast growing automotive steel market.

{"id":6156,"text":"The segment recorded an operating loss of €340 million which includes restructuring costs but excludes interest and tax costs. This follows a loss of €499 million in the second half of 2011 reflecting the continued difficult operating environment in Europe.       Compared to the same period of 2011, the segment’s crude steel production fell 8% from 15,501 Mt to 14,325 Mt as output was adjusted to weak demand levels.      Steel shipments for Q2 2012 fell to 6,771 Mt, a decrease of 9.2% as compared to 7,461 Mt for 1Q 2012. This was due to lower demand in Europe, following the end of restocking, as well as lower exports.      Sales were €5,634 million for 2Q 2012, a decrease of 4.3% as compared to €5,887 million for 1Q 2012. Sales decreased primarily due to lower steel shipment volumes offset in part by higher average steel selling prices (+4.8%).      Capital expenditure in the segment in the first half of 2012 was €375 million, slightly higher than the €356 million spent in the same period of the previous year.  Steel demand in the developed world has been impacted globally as a result of the severe problems experienced in the economy since the onset of the financial crisis at the end of 2008. Developed world demand remains far below its peak, at only 410 million tonnes in 2011 compared with 492 million tonnes in 2007.

{"id":6160,"text":"\\- Commits to maintain and invest in high-quality finishing operations   \\- Accepts request from the French government to find a buyer for the liquid phase  Given the continued economic difficulties affecting the French and European economies, the company wishes to propose to permanently close the liquid phase and concentrate efforts and investment on the high-quality finishing operation, which employs more than 2,000 employees.  To date the company had implemented a strategy of temporary idling the Florange furnaces whilst waiting to see if the economic situation would improve. However after four years of challenging conditions, it is clear that there will be no swift return to pre-crisis levels. Today European demand is still approximately 25% below 2007 levels.  This proposal has not been made lightly but it is a reality that the Florange liquid phase and the slab it produces is not competitive in today’s difficult economic context. This is due to a combination of factors, including crucially its location 400 kilometres from the nearest harbour as well as the small production output that negatively impacts fixed costs.  Although there is significant overcapacity in the European steel industry, the company has accepted the French government’s request for the government to find a buyer for the liquid phase within the next 60 days. Although the coke plant would not be part of the proposed closure, ArcelorMittal has agreed to include in the sale.  In parallel, ArcelorMittal would like to begin an exemplary social dialogue for the proposed closure of the liquid phase. Some 629 people would be affected by the project. The company understands that this information is very difficult for those employees who are affected. However the company believes that it can avoid any compulsory lay-offs by utilising a number of social mechanisms, such as mobility and the age profile of the plants, which will be agreed as part of the social dialogue in order to find a solution for each person.  The company is proposing that in the future, slab for the Florange site will continue to be transported from Dunkerque, a world class site, thereby maintaining the industrial chain in France.   ArcelorMittal will then focus on enhancing Florange’s position as a centre of excellence for developing high-quality value-added products for its customers, most notably in the automotive industry. Florange’s geographic location close to important customers in the industry; its expertise and capacity in producing high-tech steels, the group’s patents and its proximity to the Maizieres-les-Metz research and development centre, all support this strategy. For example the recent € 7.2 million investment in the existing galvanizing line will see Florange being able to produce the highest width Usibor®, in the world. ArcelorMittal is committed to continue to invest the appropriate amount to ensure a sustainable future for the finishing operations in Lorraine.   Impact of the economic crisis  ArcelorMittal’s Flat Carbon Europe segment, which includes ArcelorMittal Atlantique and Lorraine and therefore Florange, produces steel for three main sectors: automotive, industry and packaging, all of which have been significantly impacted by the economic situation and recession. The result of this has had a very negative impact on demand for steel in Europe. Today European demand is still approximately 25% below 2007 levels and any recovery is expected to be slow in the coming years.   This has in turn had a significant impact on the financial performance of FCE. Operating loss for the six month period ended June 30 2012 was EUR340 million, following a loss of EUR499 million in the second half 2011. Even in challenging economic times, steel remains a capital intensive industry. FCE capital expenditure reached US$1 billion in 2011.  Despite these significant challenges, ArcelorMittal remains very committed to its presence in France, where the company runs over 50 industrial activities across 150 operations and employs approximately 20,000 people. 35% of our flat products European production is located in France, even though the country only consumes 10% of the EU flat products market.   Commenting, Robrecht Himpe, CEO Flat Carbon Europe and member of the ArcelorMittal Management Committee, said:  \"ArcelorMittal’s operating performance has been significantly impacted by the economic situation and recession in Europe. After four years of this very difficult environment, we have regrettably concluded that given steel demand is still significantly below pre-crisis levels, we need to reconfigure our operating profile in order to strengthen the company in France and Europe to meet the ongoing challenges. ArcelorMittal fully recognises that this is a difficult announcement for those who work at the liquid phase. However it is important to emphasise that this does not represent the end of the steel industry in Lorraine. On the contrary, we will continue to invest and focus in Florange as an important centre in the transformation of slab into value-added high-quality steels for the automotive, industry and packaging sectors. Overall France remains a very important country for ArcelorMittal with 35% of our European flat products production located here, as well as one of our most important centres for research and development.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2012-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Atlantique and Lorraine announces intention to permanently close the liquid phase in Florange","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Atlantique and Lorraine met today with its central works council to discuss its intention to present a proposal for the future of its Florange plant.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-atlantique-and-lorraine-announces-intention\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6169,"text":"This follows the completion of its yearly goodwill impairment test, as required by IFRS accounting standards.  The write down will take the form of a non-cash impairment charge that will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. The impairment is due to a weaker macro economic and market environment in Europe where apparent steel demand has fallen by approximately 8% this year, bringing the cumulative demand decline to approximately 29% since 2007. This weaker demand environment, and expectations that it will persist over the near and medium term, led to a downward revision of cash flow expectations underlying the valuation of the European businesses to which goodwill has been allocated. This is in contrast to the US, where apparent steel consumption is up almost 8% this year and is now approximately 10% lower than it was in 2007.  Key metrics such as net debt and ebitda, as well as compliance with debt covenants, are unaffected by this impairment.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal to record non-cash impairment charge in Q4 2012","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announced it expects to write down the goodwill in its European businesses by approximately US$4.3bn.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-to-record-non-cash-impairment-charge\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6173,"text":"ArcelorMittal Liege today with regret informed the local works council of its intention to permanently close a number of additional assets due to a further weakening of the European economy and the resultant low demand for its products.  On 14th October 2011, ArcelorMittal Liege announced its intention to permanently idle the liquid phase due to structural over-capacity in Northern Europe. It was envisaged that in the future Liege would focus on its downstream activities, operating five core lines and seven flexible lines.      Under the flexible model, which was rejected by unions, these lines would have operated at between 0 and 100% depending on market demand. Regrettably, since October 2011, the economic outlook has further deteriorated. Demand for steel in Europe dropped by a further 8 - 9% in 2012 and is now 29% below pre-crisis levels. A number of key customers in the automotive sector have announced major restructuring projects at their plants. As a result there is insufficient demand to support the running of these flexible facilities and no improvement is seen over the medium term.      Despite the closure of the blast furnaces, the Liege facility reported an EBIT loss of more than €200million for the 9 first months of 2012 and no improvement is foreseen in 2013 due to the continued weakness of the European market. This is unsustainable on an on-going basis.      The company is therefore proposing that in order to respond to these structural market changes and further adapt to the reality of demand in Europe, the following six flexible lines need to be closed:      \\- The hot strip mill in Chertal   \\- One of the two cold rolling flows in Tilleur   \\- Galvanisation lines 4 and 5 in Flémalle   \\- Electrogalvanizing lines HP3 and 4 in Marchin  Separately organic coating line 2 in Ramet will be maintained only as a repairing line for the Combiline products.  Additionally, the company is proposing that the coke plant, which is no longer viable due to the excess supply of coke in Europe, also be permanently closed.      The company plans to continue to operate the five core lines which employ approximately 800 people. These five lines are strategic due to their dedicated high quality products, specialized processes and technological innovation.      The company recognises that this proposal will be very difficult for the local community as it affects approximately 1,300 people. It is committed to finding a socially acceptable solution for all those affected. This will include discussions on all means to reduce social impact with Trade Union representatives, including the possibility of reallocation to other sites within the Group.      Bernard Dehut, CEO, ArcelorMittal Liege, said:      “We deeply regret that the economic situation has further deteriorated to the extent that the proposal of further closures at Liege has become necessary. We recognise that this is a very difficult announcement for the employees at Liege, particularly coming so soon after the closure of the primary phase. We had hoped that that closure would be adequate in terms of adapting to the reduced demand but given the continued lack of orders and overall weakness in the European economy, it has become increasingly apparent that further action is required if we are to stem the continued losses that the plant is reporting and return it to a sustainable basis. We would ask the unions to please agree to enter into a constructive dialogue with us to secure the future of the remaining facilities in Liege.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2013-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Liege announces intention to permanently close coke plant and six finishing lines","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Liege today with regret informed the local works council of its intention to permanently close a number of additional assets due to a further weakening of the European economy and the resultant low demand for its products.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-liege-announces-intention-to-permanently\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

During the year we took a number of important steps to address the challenges we face, including concentrating our operational footprint on our more competitive assets and reducing net debt. Although we expect the challenges to continue in 2013, largely due to the fragility of the European economy, we have recently seen some more positive indicators, which combined with the measures we have implemented to strengthen the business, are expected to support an improvement in the profitability of our steel business this year.

{"id":6182,"text":"Presentations will be given by Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO; Aditya Mittal, Chief Financial Officer; Gonzalo Urquijo, GMB member with responsibility for Asia, Africa and the CIS (excluding China and India); Lou Schorsch, GMB member with responsibility for Flat Carbon Americas; Peter Kukielski, GMB member and Chief Executive Mining; Simon Wandke, Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer Mining; and Brian Aranha, Vice President of worldwide automotive.      Full copies of the presentations can be found on the Company’s website, www.arcelormittal.com.      In his presentation, Mr Mittal, Chairman and Chief Executive, will introduce the concept of what ArcelorMittal refers to as its “franchise” businesses; businesses in attractive markets where the Company has a competitive edge. Automotive, sheet piles, mechanical tubing, wide and heavy hot-rolled for high-strength applications are all examples of franchise businesses. The Company is committed to invest to grow and expand these businesses.       Automotive is a key franchise business. ArcelorMittal is the number one supplier to all the major automotive manufacturers and will continue to make the necessary investments in intellectual capital, plant and equipment in order to maintain this. The global automotive market is forecast to grow by 24% from about 80 million units in 2012 to over 100 million in 2017.[3] ArcelorMittal is well positioned to serve the automotive market with production facilities in the NAFTA region, EU27, Turkey and South America. Additionally the Company’s commercial organisation covers all regions where its global customers have a presence.       ArcelorMittal is the leader in high strength steels, which are vital to ensure steel can maintain its position as the material of choice for the auto sector. Brian Aranha, Vice President of worldwide automotive, will explain how the Company is consistently expanding its Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) offering. The S-in-motion program has developed a catalogue of solutions for achieving up to 20% of weight reduction with existing products, designed to satisfy the needs of vehicles produced up to 2020. The R&D program is already working to develop the next generation of AHSS which will be required beyond 2020, for example simulating steel solutions that will be required to meet the fuel economy targets of 54mpg in the USA and 95g\/km co2 in Europe.       Peter Kukielski will provide an update on the mining segment - another important franchise business. The Company has been steadily growing iron-ore shipments since 2008 with an emphasis on growing marketable tonnes. There are two significant steps remaining to reach its production capacity target of 84Mt by 2015 – expansion of ArcelorMittal Mines Canada and Liberia Phase 2.      The expansion at ArcelorMittal Mines Canada to a production capacity of 24MTPA is expected to be completed in the first half of 2013. This required a $1.4 billion capex investment. The existing infrastructure has the potential to support further expansion to 30 to 32Mtpa without significant additional capex. This is currently under study.       Phase 2 in Liberia has now been approved by the Board of Directors. This expansion will result in production capacity reaching 15MT pa in 2015 and will require approximately $1.5 billion of capex. The result will be a higher quality concentrate (66% Fe) compared to the current DSO (60% Fe). Major site works have already begun at the port in Buchanan, including the installation of a high speed ship loader.      In addition, the Company will provide an update on its Baffinland project. The Early Revenue Phase, which requires less capital investment than the full project, is now underway with a goal to reach a 3.5MT per annum production rate by 2015. The budget for the ERP is approximately US$700 million and will require the upgrading of the road that connects to the existing port in Milne Inlet to the mine site as well modifications to existing permits that are expected to be granted in 2013 and in the first half of 2014. Baffinland is a high grade, 66% Fe direct shipping pellet and fine ore which requires no processing or pelletization.       Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, said:      “Going forward we will protect and leverage our ‘franchise’ businesses as well as maintain a constant and rigorous focus on our costs and achievement of best internal practice. These focal points, combined with our leading market position in developed and emerging markets, our diverse mix of products, as well as our world class customer service will enable us to be successful in this new operating environment.”   ____________________________________      [1] EBITDA is defined as operating income plus depreciation, impairment expenses and exceptional items.

The online report is supplemented by a printed summary that includes the company’s CR highlights for 2012. The summary will be issued at the company’s Annual General Meeting in Luxembourg on 8 May.  The report has been externally assured by Deloitte LLP. The company has maintained the Global Reporting Initiative G3 Guidelines at level ‘B+’ in preparing the full online report.  The report focuses on how product innovation is helping to support the development of a low carbon economy, with steel playing a vital role in the transport, automotive, construction and manufacturing markets.  “The success of our business is directly linked to the advancement of society – steel is the fabric of modern life. We are supporting transport infrastructure, making cars lighter and more fuel efficient through innovative solutions such as S-in motion and iCAReTM for electric cars” said Lakshmi N. Mittal, chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal.  In addition, the report reinforces ArcelorMittal’s priorities of employee health and safety – the company’s number one priority - and responsible sourcing.  Focusing on safety, the report details the company’s progress in its safety programme ‘Journey to Zero’, most notably in its 2012 lost time injury frequency rate of 1.0 – reaching the 2013 target one year early. However, it also acknowledges that there is still much to be done to reach the target of zero injuries and fatalities and emphasises the proactive steps being taken to achieve this goal.  Other 2012 highlights include:    * Research and development: ArcelorMittal invested $285m in research and development into product and process innovation. This was supplemented by a capital expenditure of more than $321m, dedicated to environment and energy-related investments.   * Energy consumption – In 2012 the average energy used per tonne of liquid steel decreased to 23.5GJ compared to 23.8GJ in 2011.   * Responsible sourcing – ArcelorMittal assessed 295 major suppliers against its responsible sourcing criteria during the year and launched an online training module for buyers, which was completed by 400 buyers.   * Human rights – 85% of the workforce have now completed human rights training which is more than 200,000 employees.   * Community investment: The ArcelorMittal Foundation invested $41.1m in more than 725 local community projects.   * External recognition:   * Named the leading steel producer by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and ranked on main list for the third year in succession.   * Ranked fourth by Transparency International (out of 105 listed companies surveyed) for standards of reporting, in recognition of the progress made in external disclosures related to anti-corruption and bribery.   * Rated number one globally by every automotive R&D customer.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2013-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Steel: the fabric of sustainable growth - ArcelorMittal publishes Corporate Responsibility Report for 2012","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal, the world’s leading steel and mining company, today published its 2012 Corporate Responsibility (CR) Report, Steel: the fabric of sustainable growth.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/steel-the-fabric-of-sustainable-growth\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6190,"text":"Using steels and technology currently available, ArcelorMittal’s global research and development (R&D) automotive team has demonstrated that a 27 percent weight and cost saving can be achieved without compromising safety and structural requirements. By looking ahead to new advanced high strength steels and technology that will come to market over the next few years, the team has identified additional solutions that will deliver even greater weight savings – up to 34 percent compared to existing steel car door solutions.  Opening the door to weight savings  Carmakers need to reduce the weight of their vehicles in order to meet future regulations; currently-enacted regulations in Europe (tailpipe emissions) come into full force in 2015 and those for the USA (tailpipe emissions and fuel economy) come into full force in 2021. With even tougher standards being considered for the years ahead to 2025 in both regions, every part of the vehicle is being studied to determine where weight can be reduced. By reducing the weight of the vehicle by around 12 kg (26 lbs), one gram of CO2-equivalent emissions per kilometre (1.6 g\/mile) is saved.  Brian Aranha, vice president automotive worldwide said: “As the leading supplier of steels to the global automotive industry, we have worked with all carmakers for many years to help them reduce the weight of their vehicles. ArcelorMittal’s S-in motion study launched in November 2010 has already identified a whole range of innovative steel solutions that are significantly reducing the weight of the body-in-white (BIW) of current and future production vehicles, including hang-on parts such as doors. This is the next step for us in continuing to offer weight saving solutions and subsequently cost savings to our customers. Automotive is one of our franchise businesses and we are discussing with all the major OEMs to work with them to integrate these new solutions into the design of future cars.”  ### Short-term weight savings with existing steel grades  Using a combination of existing advanced high strength steels (AHSS) and ultra high strength steels (UHSS) it is now possible to reduce the weight of the baseline C-segment door from 18.3 kg (40.3 lbs) to just 13.3 kg (29.3 lbs) while meeting standard structural and safety requirements. This is truly a momentous weight reduction for one automotive application, especially considering automotive weight savings is typically measured in grams. This short-term solution uses UHSS grades such as MS 1500 and Usibor® for structural parts, and Dual Phase steels such as FF280DP for the outer panel. These steels are available now and are already being utilised in production vehicles today.  In the redesigned outer panel of the short-term front door solution, a 0.6 mm FF280DP grade is used and local reinforcements (patches) are added to improve stiffness. This solution also includes a new laser welded blank (LWB) inner panel concept with a very thin gauge.  Part of the weight savings in both the short- and medium-term solutions is achieved by using thinner steel for the outer door panel. Known as down-gauging, this technique is only possible with steels that exhibit increased yield strength while ensuring the doors will pass industry standards for dent resistance.  ### Medium-term solutions with new steel grades in development  The ‘medium-term’ solutions go further in lightweighting while maintaining the same performance levels. Local properties are optimized by the use of LWBs. Several options are possible in order to match the different types of doors to each customer’s need. The new high strength steels and technology will come to market in the next few years, making these solutions available by 2017.  The requirements of a C-segment door include the management of both frontal and lateral crash load cases. ArcelorMittal proposes an evolution of the short-term solution toward lighter doors with up to a 34 percent weight reduction, resulting in a total door weight of about 12 kg (26.4 lbs). This involves innovative steel grades which are currently under development such as Usibor® 2000 for some non-visible parts and other AHSS for the outer panel in order to reduce the outer panel thickness to 0.5 mm. The requirements for larger D-segment doors do not include the frontal crash load cases, allowing lighter doors with more limited light weighting potential.  Greg Ludkovsky, vice president global R&D said: “Many key innovations in automotive steel products and solutions in the past 10 years have come from ArcelorMittal’s R&D teams. By applying the present solutions, a car door can be 30 percent less expensive than an aluminium door. Innovative steel solutions like the ultra lightweight car door solutions are further proof that steel is by far the most sustainable, the most versatile and the most affordable material to help carmakers produce lighter vehicles and achieve their weight reduction targets on time. ”  For more information and illustrations about ArcelorMittal’s new ultra lightweight car door solutions, please visit: www.arcelormittal.com\/automotive","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2013-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal unveils new ultra lightweight car door solutions offering up to 34 percent weight savings over existing steel car doors","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel and mining company, today unveiled its new, innovative ultra lightweight car door solutions.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-unveils-new-ultra-lightweight-car-door-solutions\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6197,"text":"ArcelorMittal initially planned to construct a 12 million tonne integrated steel plant in Keonjhar and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Odisha in December 2006.   Since that date, ArcelorMittal has completed important milestones such as the completion of a feasibility report, an environmental impact assessment study and other relevant technical reports, as well as holding eight gram sabhas (public hearings) and investing in a number of CSR projects.  However, unfortunately the project has faced significant external delays. ArcelorMittal has not been able to acquire the requisite land for the steel plant, nor has it been able to ensure captive iron ore security, which is a necessary requirement for the project. Therefore, taking into account the current economic climate, ArcelorMittal has concluded it will no longer be pursuing its plans for a steel plant in Keonjhar at this stage.  This announcement does not affect ArcelorMittal’s plan to pursue its two other Indian projects in Jharkhand and Karnataka.  Vijay Bhatnagar, executive vice president and member of the management committee, CEO of India and China: “Over the last seven years we have invested considerable resources into this project; however, the delays relating to land acquisition and allocation of captive iron ore blocks means this project is no longer viable.

{"id":6202,"text":"The plan includes a project to more than double the plant’s production capacity from 1 million to 2.2 million tons per year by 2017.  The plan will see ArcelorMittal reduce its shareholding in both ArcelorMittal Annaba and ArcelorMittal Tebessa to 49%, with the state of Algeria holding the remaining share of 51%. The investment plan will be funded by equity contributions from shareholders and bank financing. The shareholders’ agreement between the parties involved is to be signed in the coming days.  This plan will ensure a long term future for steelmaking in Annaba and mining in Tebessa, where the production unit will be modernized through the relining of the blast furnace, modernization of the sinter plant, the steel plant and the rolling mills. A new electric steel plant will be built (including an electric arc furnace and continuous casting line) and the downstream units will be reinforced with the construction of a new rolling mill for rebar and wire rod with a production capacity of 1 million tons.  The investment will allow ArcelorMittal Annaba to better respond to increasing domestic demand for steel products in Algeria and to positively contribute to the government’s drive to promote self-sufficiency in steel.  The agreement includes a human resources development plan. Intensive training will be provided to employees in order to adapt to the new technologies planned. This plan is backed by a social stability pact that has been agreed with the unions.  “We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Sider, with whom we have always enjoyed a strong relationship. The agreement will enable ArcelorMittal Annaba and ArcelorMittal Tebessa to play a long term role in Algeria’s steel and mining industries.

{"id":6214,"text":"The segment recorded an operating loss of €366m for Q4 2013. Operating performance in the fourth quarter was impacted by net restructuring charges of €236m, primarily as a result of the industrial and social plan in Liege and review of Florange primary production.  Q4 2013 losses compare with an operating loss of €131m in Q3 2013.   This segment’s crude steel production remained flat, compared to Q3 2013, at 7.4 million tonnes.  Steel shipments in Q4 2013 were 6.7 million tonnes, an increase of 1.6% as compared to the previous quarter, due to a mild pick- up in demand following the seasonally weak third quarter.  Sales in the Flat Carbon Europe segment also increased by 0.8% to €4.83bn, compared with €4.78bn in the third quarter. This was primarily due to higher steel shipment volumes.  Ebitda for the quarter increased by 11.6% to €163m, compared with €146m in the third quarter. This resulted mainly from a positive volume effect and excellent operational performance across FCE mills.  Commenting, Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO Flat Carbon Europe, said:  “We are seeing the positive effects of asset optimisation and an improved operational performance across FCE mills in 2013 results. With a recovery in underlying steel demand and mild restocking, we expect to see European steel demand rise by around 2% in 2014.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2014-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Flat Carbon Europe reports €366m operating loss for Q4 2013","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announced results for its Flat Carbon Europe segment for the fourth quarter of 2013.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-flat-carbon-europe-reports-366m\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6223,"text":"The segment recorded an operating profit of €58 million for the first three months of 2014. This compares with an operating loss of €396 million in Q4 2013. Comparable operating performance for Q4 2013 was impacted by impairment and restructuring charges totalling €302 million. There were no such impairment or restructuring charges this quarter.  Ebitda for the quarter also rose, by 29% to €390 million, compared with €302 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This improvement has been mainly driven by higher shipments and a positive price cost effect.  ArcelorMittal Europe crude steel production increased by 4.3% to 10.9 million tonnes, compared with Q4 2013, following the restart of the blast furnace in Dabrowa Gornicza, Poland, as maintenance work concluded.  Steel shipments in Q1 2014 were 10.0 million tonnes, an increase of 5.6% compared with the previous quarter. Flat product shipment volumes increased by 5.8% and long product shipment volumes increased by 6.0%, both benefitting from seasonality and improved underlying demand.  Sales in the ArcelorMittal Europe segment also increased by 1.6% to €7.5 billion, compared with €7.4 billion in the fourth quarter. This was primarily due to higher steel shipments.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said:  “ArcelorMittal Europe’s first quarter results for 2014 show a combination of a gradually improving economy and the results of measures the company has taken to adapt to the new demand environment. As the pace of recovery in the EU has been slightly stronger than expected when we announced our full year results in February, we have upgraded our forecast for European steel demand in 2014 from around 2%, to 2-3%, and therefore remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2014-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe reports €58m operating profit for Q1 2014","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe today announced results for the first quarter of 2014.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-reports-58m-operating-profit\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

This compares with an operating profit of €58 million in Q1 2014 and an operating loss of €143 million for Q2 2013, when results were impacted by restructuring and impairment charges totalling €125m. There were no such impairment or restructuring charges in Q2 2014.  Ebitda for the second quarter of 2014 also rose, by 29%, to €503m, compared with €390m in the first quarter of this year.

ArcelorMittal Europe has reported an operating profit in all four quarters of 2014, with the business realising the benefits of its cost optimisation measures, lower input costs and better margins due to improved steel market conditions and a stronger focus on new and specialised products.       Fourth quarter 2014 Ebitda increased by 12.4%, to €443m compared with €394m in the previous three months of the year. Ebitda in Q4 2014 was also 46.7% higher than in the same quarter of 2013. Full year Ebitda for 2014 was €1730m compared to €1227m for 2013.      Steel shipments in Q4 2014 were 9.6 million tonnes; a decrease of 2.2% compared with the previous quarter, on account of operational issues in some sites and lower exports for the quarter. Year-on-year, shipments for the fourth quarter rose as a result of improved domestic demand.      Sales in the ArcelorMittal Europe segment decreased by 1.3% to €7.2bn this quarter, compared with €7.3bn in the third quarter. This was primarily due to lower shipments.       Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said:       “I am pleased to be able to report the fourth consecutive quarterly profit for ArcelorMittal Europe, as well as a 41% year-on-year increase in Ebitda. This Ebitda rise shows the expansion in our steel margins thanks to lower costs, which are the result of our cost optimisation efforts and improved market conditions. For 2015, we are forecasting steel demand growth of 1.5 to 2.5%, for Europe, with the effects of a weak Euro and low oil prices helping to boost confidence within the Eurozone”.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2015-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe reports €122m operating profit for Q4 2014","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe today announced its results for the fourth quarter ended 31 December 2014.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-reports-122m-operating-profit\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6246,"text":"Strategic progress in 2014:  The Company has made notable progress on its strategic objectives during 2014, including:    * Increased steel volumes by 3% given improved demand in its core steel markets   * Expanded steel margins by $14\/t through continued focus on cost optimization: leveraging benefits of European restructuring, improved performance of ACIS operations as well as lower raw material costs   * Expanded mining volumes (including a 4Q 2014 annualized production rate of 26Mt at ArcelorMittal Mines Canada (AMMC)) whilst further reducing mining costs (4Q 2014 AMMC concentrate unit cost 25% lower than FY 2013 average)   * Further developed its automotive steel franchise including new capacity (Calvert, VAMA) and new product launches   * Net debt declined to its lowest level since the ArcelorMittal merger which together with lower average cost of debt reduced net interest expense by $0.3 billion    Outlook and guidance:    * The Company expects Group EBITDA to be within the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for 2015   * Steel segments: Overall, steel markets continue to grow, in particular for our high value-added products; a forecast 4-5% increase in shipment volumes (approximately half of which follows the Newcastle reline completion and full year impact of the restart of BF#3 in Tubarao, Brazil) together with improved cost performance are expected to offset the impact of lower transaction prices and the impacts of translation   * Mining segment: Assuming current market conditions, in excess of one-third of the impact of lower iron ore prices on revenues will be offset by improved cost performance including the benefits of foreign exchange, energy and freight as well as higher volumes   * Additionally, the Company expects net interest expense to decline to approximately $1.4 billion and capital expenditure to decline to approximately $3.4 billion in 2015   * As a result, at the bottom end of the guidance range the Company would expect to be free cash flow positive.

First quarter 2015 Ebitda increased by 23.3 per cent, to €546m compared with €443m in the last quarter of 2014. Ebitda in Q1 2015 was also 40 per cent higher than in the corresponding quarter of 2014, reflecting improved demand dynamics and the ongoing realisation of the benefits of cost optimisation efforts.       Steel shipments in the first quarter increased by 10.9 per cent to 10.7 million tonnes, compared with Q4 2014, as both flat and long product shipment volumes benefitted from seasonal impacts and improved underlying demand.      Sales in the ArcelorMittal Europe segment increased by 5.9 per cent to €7.6bn this quarter compared to Q4 2014. This was primarily due to higher steel shipments partly offset by lower average steel selling prices.

{"id":6268,"text":"While Ebitda for the quarter was €496 million, the segment recorded an operating loss of €23 million, compared with an operating profit of €125 million for Q3 2014.  Record levels of imports, particularly from China and the CIS, have placed significant downward pressure on European steel prices. As a result, the segment’s operating profit for the third quarter was negatively impacted by a €256 million exceptional charge related to the write-down of inventory following the rapid decline of international steel prices.   ArcelorMittal Europe sales also decreased by -5.7 per cent to €6.9 billion this quarter, from €7.3 billion in the corresponding quarter last year, as a result of lower average selling prices and marginally lower steel shipments. Steel shipments in the third quarter decreased by -1.9 per cent to 9.6 million tonnes, compared with Q3 2014.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said: “Record, and still rising, levels of imports are materially impacting steel prices. Certain EU anti-dumping investigations are underway, but the process is slow and needs to be more efficient in order to effectively and fairly protect European steel producers from unfair trade. The ongoing price deterioration has led us to book a €256 million exceptional charge for the quarter, meaning we have reported an operating loss for the first time in seven quarters.\"  “Outlook for European steel demand remains positive, and we forecast apparent steel consumption in 2016 at similar levels to the +2 per cent we have seen for this year. However, given imports into the European market are forecast to remain at high levels, we anticipate pricing pressure to continue into 2016, which will make it challenging for European steelmakers to benefit from the ongoing demand recovery.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2015-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe reports operating loss of €23 million for Q3 2015","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe today announced its results for the third quarter ended 30 September 2015.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-reports-operating-loss-of-23-million\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6269,"text":"Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, ArcelorMittal Chairman and CEO, said:  “Whilst we have delivered stable EBITDA compared with the second quarter, the already challenging operating conditions have further deteriorated during recent months, largely due to additional declines in steel prices caused by exceptionally low Chinese export prices. Our focus is on ensuring we take all the necessary steps to strengthen our competitiveness in this difficult environment. Measures we have taken so far are yielding results; costs in our mining division have reduced by 17% so far in 2015 versus an initial target of 15%, and net debt is $1 billion lower than a year ago. Whilst we expect market conditions to remain challenging in 2016, we have a number of important programs underway across the business which will structurally improve EBITDA in 2016 and we also expect a significant reduction in our cash requirements.”  “Whilst we are confident our actions are the right ones, there are also important issues for governments to address, specifically relating to unfair trade.

{"id":6270,"text":"Mr Schorsch joined the company in 2003 as CEO of Ispat Inland.      Going forward it has been decided to structure the Americas business with dedicated leadership for four distinct business areas.      Jim Baske will be Executive Vice President of ArcelorMittal and chief Executive Officer ArcelorMittal North America (excluding USA).  John Brett, currently executive vice president finance, planning and procurement for ArcelorMittal USA, will be appointed chief executive of ArcelorMittal USA effective 1st January 2016. Andy Harshaw, the current CEO of ArcelorMittal USA, is retiring but will stay with the company until 31st March 2016 to assist with the leadership transition.       In South America, Jefferson de Paula and Benjamin Baptista will continue as CEO South America Long and CEO South America Flat respectively.       All four will report to group chairman and CEO, Lakshmi N. Mittal.       Brian Aranha, currently vice president global automotive and commercial coordination, will assume leadership responsibilities for Mr Schorsch’s additional roles of strategy, CTO, R&D, CCM and global automotive, also reporting to Mr Lakshmi Mittal. He will be supported by David Clarke as head of strategy and CTO, Greg Ludkovsky as head of R&D and Brad Davey as head of global automotive.       Separately Robrecht Himpe, currently executive vice president and CTO of ArcelorMittal, will be appointed chief executive of AM\/NS Calvert, working closely with AM\/NS Calvert president Chris Richards and the rest of the Calvert team to accelerate the ramp-up of this important asset.       Commenting Mr Mittal said, \"Since joining the company in 2003, Lou has been an integral member of our senior leadership team. With a keen intellect and deep understanding of the dynamics of our industry as a result of his experience in both consultancy and operational roles, he has been a strong leader who is held in high esteem by all who know and work with him. We wish him all the best for his retirement.\"       “There are a number of important priorities in the Americas business at present and therefore we took the decision to split out the leadership responsibilities into four key areas, directly reporting to the CEO. We believe this is the optimum structure to ensure each division fully delivers on their business plans and puts in place the necessary actions to respond to current market challenges and capture market opportunities. Jim, John, Jefferson and Benjamin are all experienced leaders and fully understand the priorities in today’s market environment. Additionally I am very pleased that Robrecht has agreed to become CEO of AM\/NS Calvert. The opportunities for Calvert are considerable and it has an important contribution to make to the US$1 billion of structural Ebitda improvements the group is targeting globally for 2016. As one of our most experienced industry executives, I am very confident in Robrecht’s ability to ensure we capture all the upside potential from this outstanding asset.”       Additionally Mr BC Agarwal, 64, group head of finance and member of the management committee, will retire effective the end of February 2016. Mr Agarwal joined the company in 1973 and was involved in the setting up of the first plant in Indonesia. Genuino Christino will take up the position of group head of finance, reporting to Aditya Mittal, group CFO and CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe.       Commenting Mr Mittal said: “Bhikam was one of the first employees of ArcelorMittal. He was with me in the early days in Indonesia when we had nothing but a green field in front of us and has been with the company ever since. His energy, enthusiasm and knowledge will be much missed but I can only wish him an extremely well deserved retirement.\"      Aditya Mittal said: \"Mr Agarwal has made an outstanding contribution to this company over more than 40 years. He is someone who will always be considered part of ArcelorMittal, even in his retirement. His shoes are hard to fill but I have worked very closely with Genuino for a number of years now and have great confidence in his ability to step into this important position.\"      ArcelorMittal will also take the opportunity to simplify the management structure in-line with the ongoing drive to promote a performance-driven culture, empowering the segments to deliver optimum business results. As a result the Group Management Board, which was established to ensure a smooth integration following the creation of ArcelorMittal, will be replaced with a more flexible structure. The CEO office - comprising the CEO and CFO - will work directly with a team of seven executive officers, who collectively encompass the key regions and corporate functions.   The executive officers are as follows:  Senior executive vice president    * Davinder Chugh Senior executive vice president, CEO of Africa and the CIS    Executive vice presidents    * Brian Aranha Executive vice president, head of strategy, CTO, R&D, CCM and global automotive   * Jim Baske Executive vice president, CEO ArcelorMittal Nafta Flat Rolled   * Henri Blaffart Executive vice president, group head of HR and corporate services   * Jefferson de Paula Executive vice president, CEO of ArcelorMittal South America Long   * Geert van Poelvoorde Executive vice president, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe Flat   * Simon Wandke Executive vice president, CEO of ArcelorMittal Mining","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2015-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal announces new organisational structure for the Americas and group finance","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announces that Lou Schorsch, 66, senior executive vice president, member of the Group Management Board and CEO of ArcelorMittal Americas will retire from the company, effective end of February 2016.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-announces-new-organisational\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6274,"text":"For the full year 2015, the Europe segment reported an operating profit of €145m. This compares with an operating profit of €549m in 2014, reflecting the impact of lower steel prices on the business. Full-year Ebitda for 2015 was €2,158m, compared with €1,730m in 2014.      For the fourth quarter of 2015, ArcelorMittal Europe recorded an operating loss of €465m, compared with a profit of €122m for the same quarter in 2014. However the Q4 2015 performance was impacted by impairments of €366m, primarily in connection with the temporary idling of ArcelorMittal Sestao in Spain, as well as €316m of inventory write-downs following the rapid decline of steel prices.       Ebitda in Q4 2015 improved by 12.5% year-on-year, mainly due to lower costs and efficiency improvements partly offset by lower average steel selling prices (-10.2%) and lower steel shipments (-1.4%).       In terms of production, crude steel production fell by 8.2% to 10 million tonnes in the final quarter of 2015, compared with the previous quarter, primarily due to lower demand and maintenance works including the reline of a blast furnace in Dunkirk, France, and repairs to a blast furnace in Gent, Belgium.       The business’ 2015 performance has been significantly impacted by the drop in steel prices in Europe, as a result of lower demand in China which has caused record levels of unfairly priced imports into the European Union.       ArcelorMittal, together with all steel producers in Europe, has been consistently calling for the European Union to use trade defence instruments to impose tariffs on unfairly priced steel imports, in order to ensure a long-term future for the steel industry in Europe.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2016-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe reports €145m operating profit for 2015","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe today announced its results for the full year 2015 and the fourth quarter ended 31 December 2015.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-reports-145m-operating-profit\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

The Action 2020 plan represents a strategic roadmap for each of ArcelorMittal’s main business segments. The Action 2020 plan is over and above the Company’s ongoing management gains plan and seeks to deliver real structural improvements unique to ArcelorMittal’s business. The Action 2020 plan targets a return to >$85\/t EBITDA absent any recovery in steel spreads and raw materials prices from current levels. The Action 2020 plan targets a further structural EBITDA improvement of approximately $3.0 billion. Upon full achievement of the plan, the Company would expect to deliver free cash flow in excess of $2.0 billion annually.  Outlook and guidance:  As indicated at 3Q 2015 results, a combination of Company actions and known developments is expected to support EBITDA in 2016 by $1.0 billion relative to the 4Q 2015 annual run-rate level. Due to order book and the time lag required for lower raw material costs to positively impact cost of sales, EBITDA is expected to sequentially decline in 1Q 2016. Based on the assumption of prevailing raw material costs and spot steel spreads, the Company expects FY 2016 EBITDA to be in excess of $4.5 billion. This guidance does not capture any upside to current market conditions.  Reducing the cash requirements of the business:  The Company targets a reduction of the cash requirements of the business in 2016 by in excess of $1.0 billion as compared to 2015.

{"id":6277,"text":"The transaction is unconditional and payment is expected to be made to ArcelorMittal within six months. In addition to the cash consideration, ArcelorMittal will receive a payment of €10m as a 2015 dividend.       ArcelorMittal entered into a joint venture with the Riberas family in 1998 with the intent of developing, through Gestamp, the business of stamping, assembly and welded blanks for automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Over the years, Gestamp has established itself as a global market leader in the design and manufacture of metal components and assemblies for sale to automotive OEMs, with a leadership position in hot-stamped technology. Gestamp now operates 95 plants located in 20 countries, supplying body-in-white, chassis structures, opening systems and mechanisms to all the major car manufacturers from Europe, the Americas and Asia.      ArcelorMittal will continue its supply relationship with Gestamp through its 35% shareholding in Gonvarri, a sister company of Gestamp. ArcelorMittal sells coils to Gonvarri for processing before they pass to Gestamp and other customers. Further, ArcelorMittal will continue to have a board presence in Gestamp, collaborate in automotive R&D and remain its major steel supplier.       Aditya Mittal, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe and group CFO, said: \"The sale of our stake in Gestamp unlocks substantial value for ArcelorMittal’s shareholders and is consistent with our stated strategy of portfolio optimisation.

The record date for ArcelorMittal shares is expected to be on March 14, 2016 at the close of business on each applicable market where the shares are traded.

{"id":6294,"text":"Lower prices were however offset in part by higher steel shipment volumes and improved cost performance.       ArcelorMittal Europe reported an operating profit of €77m for the first three months of the year, compared with a €465m operating loss in the previous quarter. The fourth quarter 2015 performance was significantly impacted by impairments and inventory write-downs. Comparing year-on-year, ArcelorMittal Europe reported an operating profit of €281m for the first quarter of 2015.       The Europe segment’s crude steel production for Q1 2016 rose 11.9% to 11.2 million tonnes, compared with the previous three months. Sales also rose, by 0.6% to €6.5bn, driven by a 13.7% increase in demand for flat steel products and an overall 10.3% increase in steel shipments, compared with Q4 2015.       While steel spreads have improved since the start of 2016, price rises are not expected to be visible until the second quarter.       Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe and CFO ArcelorMittal, said:      “Today we reported a 34% drop in Ebitda, which shows the impact of low steel prices on our business - although we were able to offset some of the effect of low prices thanks to our ongoing focus on cost performance.       Today’s results also reflect improved demand for steel in Europe. Our shipments rose by more than 10% to 10.4 million tonnes in Q1 2016, compared with the final quarter of 2015. This stronger demand has led to a welcome improvement in steel spreads, in recent months – resulting in a tight market, for flat products in particular. However, the market remains highly volatile; we must remain vigilant against steel dumping in Europe, in order to ensure that steel is traded in line with WTO regulations.”      Steel demand in Europe this year is expected to remain more than 21% below pre-2007 levels, compared with the Nafta region where demand is forecast to be 4.6% below 2007 levels (see chart, below).","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2016-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe reports €328m Ebitda for first quarter of 2016","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe has announced its results for the first quarter of 2016, reporting a 34% drop in Ebitda to €328m compared with Q4 2015, mainly due to a 7.2% decline in average steel selling prices for the first three months of 2016.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-reports-328m-ebitda-for-first\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

At the Early Tender Time, the Company determined a single Clearing Premium of $42.50 based on the Bid Premiums (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) for all Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time in accordance with the modified “Dutch Auction” procedure described in the section “The Offers—Description of the Offers—Clearing Premium and Total Consideration” in the Offer to Purchase. The “ Total Consideration ” set forth in the table above for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time and not validly withdrawn and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers is equal to the sum of: (i) the Minimum Bid Price for the relevant Series and (ii) the Clearing Premium determined in accordance with this modified “Dutch Auction” procedure.

{"id":6302,"text":"Year-on-year, Q2 operating profit in 2016 was slightly lower compared to €352m in Q2 2015. However, operating income in Q2 2016 was negatively impacted by an impairment of €44m relating to the sale of ArcelorMittal Zaragoza in Spain.       A year-on-year Ebitda comparison shows a 4.2% improvement to €643m, principally due to lower costs and efficiency improvements as a result of ArcelorMittal Europe’s ongoing transformation plan. This was offset in part by lower selling prices, which were down by around 11%.       Commenting on the results, Aditya Mittal, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe, said:       “Today’s results from ArcelorMittal Europe show the combined effect of improved market conditions compared with the beginning of the year, and our ongoing transformation plan which is making the business more efficient. While we are pleased with today’s results, Europe remains exposed to the effects of steel dumping. Although we have been encouraged by the high-level political engagement on this matter in recent months, it remains important that this translates into robust trade defence measures”.

{"id":6305,"text":"Subject to the Maximum Tender Cap, the amount of a Series of Notes that is purchased in the Offers on the applicable Settlement Date (as defined below) will be based on the numerical order of priority (the “ Acceptance Priority Level ”) for such Series, subject to the proration arrangements applicable to the Offers, as set forth in the table above.  This announcement does not contain the full terms and conditions of the Offers, which are contained in the offer to purchase dated September 7, 2016 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “ Offer to Purchase ”), and is subject to the offer restrictions set out below and more fully described in the Offer to Purchase.  Notes may be validly tendered at any time on or before 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 4, 2016, unless extended (as may be extended, the “ Expiration Time ”). Notes must be tendered in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Offer to Purchase. To receive the Total Consideration (as defined herein), plus any Accrued Interest, Holders must tender their Notes prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 20, 2016, unless extended (such time, as the same may be extended, the “ Early Tender Time ”). The “ Total Consideration ” is the U.S. dollar amount payable per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes set forth in the table above and includes an early tender premium of $50 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (the “ Early Tender Premium ”). Holders who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Time but at or prior to the Expiration Time will only be eligible to receive the “ Tender Consideration ”, which is the applicable Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Premium, plus any Accrued Interest.  Subject to applicable law, the Company expressly reserves the right, but is not obligated to, increase the Maximum Tender Cap in its sole and absolute discretion without extending the Early Tender Time, the Withdrawal Deadline (as defined below) or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights.  Subject to the Maximum Tender Cap and the proration arrangements applicable to the Offers, all Notes of a Series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Time having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any tendered Notes of a Series having a lower Acceptance Priority Level. Among any Notes validly tendered following the Early Tender Time but at or prior to the Expiration Time, Notes having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any Notes tendered following the Early Tender Time having a lower Acceptance Priority Level, subject to the Maximum Tender Cap. If the Offers are not fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Time, subject to the Maximum Tender Cap, Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Time will be accepted for purchase in priority to Notes tendered following the Early Tender Time even if such Notes tendered following the Early Tender Time have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time. As such, Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time will be accepted for purchase in priority to Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time, and to the extent that Notes are tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time, the Maximum Tender Cap available after the Early Tender Time could be reduced significantly or altogether. Accordingly, if the Maximum Tender Cap is reached in respect of tenders made at or prior to the Early Tender Time, no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time will be accepted for purchase (irrespective of their priority level).  With respect to the Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time and not validly withdrawn and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers, the Company expects to pay the Total Consideration, together with any accrued and unpaid interest from, and including, the immediately preceding interest payment date applicable to such Notes to, but excluding, the applicable Settlement Date (the “ Accrued Interest ”), to the Holders on the third Business Day after the Early Tender Time, expected to be September 23, 2016 (such date, the “ Early Settlement Date ”). With respect to Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Time but at or prior to the Expiration Time and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers, the Company expects to pay the Tender Consideration, together with any Accrued Interest, to the Holders thereof on the third Business Day after the Expiration Time, expected to be October 7, 2016 (such date the “ Final Settlement Date ”; each of the Early Settlement Date and the Final Settlement Date, a “ Settlement Date ”).

{"id":6309,"text":"Year-on-year, operating profit has risen significantly, albeit from a very low base; ArcelorMittal Europe reported an operating loss of €23m in the third quarter of 2015, when European steel prices were under strong downward pressure from record levels of imports.       A year-on-year Ebitda comparison shows a 29.4% rise to €642m, compared with Q3 2015, primarily on account of lower costs and efficiency improvements, offset in part by lower steel volumes (-2.7%) and lower average steel selling prices (-3.3%).       In terms of steel production, ArcelorMittal Europe’s crude steel production decreased by 1.4% to 10.6 million tonnes in Q3 2016, compared with 10.7 million tonnes in Q2 2016 as a result of seasonal planned stoppages.      Commenting on the results, Aditya Mittal, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe, said:    “Today’s results from ArcelorMittal Europe reflect the usual seasonal slowdown in production and shipments, but also the improved pricing environment and the impact of measures to make the business more efficient. Operating profit has improved 8.9% in the past three months and is also positive year-on-year.      We remain concerned about unfair trade. We have seen some positive trade case rulings this year but a comprehensive solution is required across all product categories, to prevent anti-competitive behaviour in the European market.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2016-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe reports €371m operating profit for Q3 2016","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe has reported its third quarter 2016 results, with a €371m operating profit for the three months to 30 September 2016 – higher than the €340m operating profit reported in the second quarter of 2016.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-reports-371m-operating-profit\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6310,"text":"New grades will help automakers achieve mandated lightweighting targets and promote more sustainable lifestyles  These innovative steels include the launch of new press hardenable steels (PHS) Ductibor® 1000 and Usibor® 2000 – both of which are already available for OEM qualification testing in Europe - and martensitic steels MartINsite® M1700 and M2000. The company is also preparing to expand its family of third generation advanced high strength steel (3G AHSS), which currently includes Fortiform® 1050 in Europe, starting in 2017. Together, these new steel grades will help automakers further reduce body-in-white weight to improve fuel economy without compromising vehicle safety or performance.  “The launch of these steels aligns with our Action 2020 program, a strategic roadmap that aims to achieve targeted financial improvements for the company by 2020,” said Brian Aranha, executive vice president, global automotive, ArcelorMittal. “Action 2020 efforts include cost optimization and steel shipment volume increases, as well as an improved portfolio of high added value products. These products ensure ArcelorMittal is best positioned to meet customer requirements via a strong technical and product portfolio.”  ArcelorMittal is now able to provide samples of Ductibor® 1000 to customers for qualification testing in North America. Ductibor® 1000 is a high-strength press hardenable steel that offers good energy absorption capacity. Typical applications for Ductibor® 1000 include energy absorption parts such as front and rear rails and lower B-pillars.  Usibor® 2000, an aluminum-silicon coated PHS and stronger than its predecessor Usibor® 1500, enables automakers to fabricate parts with complicated geometry at a very high strength without formability or springback challenges. Typical applications for Usibor® 2000 include strength-critical passenger compartment parts such as rockers, pillars, roof rails and cross members. Usibor® 2000 is currently available in Europe for OEM qualifications and will be available in North America in early 2017 with commercial production expected in late summer 2017.  “Usibor® is our key product in hot stamping and has been a major commercial and technical success in the global automotive industry,” said Mr. Aranha. “Looking ahead, the scope of hot stamping products in vehicles will continue to increase with the release of more advanced products like Usibor® 2000, which offers 10 to 15% weight savings when compared to existing hot stamping solutions.”      Usibor® 2000 is compatible with standard press hardening technologies and processes. Combining Usibor® 2000 with Ductibor® 1000 or other PHS into laser welded blanks (LWB) offers several significant advantages. These advantages include weight saving, improved crash behaviour and cost savings through material and manufacturing optimisation.  ArcelorMittal is also expanding its MartINsite® family of products to include MartINsite® M1700 and M2000, joining currently available MartINsite® M900, M1100, M1300 and M1500.  “MartINsite® is a very strong family of steels which are perfect for anti-intrusion parts such as bumper and door beams,” explained Mr. Aranha.  ArcelorMittal will have MartINsite® M1700 and M2000 available for OEM qualifications by mid-2017. The grades will be available for commercial production in early 2018.  All MartINsite® steels, Usibor® 1500 and 2000, and Ductibor® 500 and 1000 are all patented by ArcelorMittal.  ArcelorMittal is also investing in AM\/NS Calvert, its joint venture with Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metals Corp. in Alabama, USA, to produce 3G AHSS cold-stamping steels in North America. Currently available and branded as Fortiform® in Europe, these High Formability (HF) steels provide strengths similar to the strongest dual phase steels, but with higher ductility and cold formability.  ArcelorMittal will produce cold-rolled and galvanized\/galvannealed versions of HF 980 and HF 1180 in North America, targeting OEM qualifications by mid-2017. Commercial production, beginning with the cold-rolled grades, will occur in late 2017. Thanks to their excellent mechanical properties, these HF grades are particularly suitable for components limited by energy absorption, such as front and rear rails and upper motor compartment rails.  In Europe, an investment program is underway at ArcelorMittal Gent and ArcelorMittal Liege in Belgium, to increase ArcelorMittal’s annual European production of 3G AHSS.   Globally, ArcelorMittal boasts some of the most technologically advanced automotive steelmaking operations and incorporates a range of modern steelmaking technologies. Approximately 30% of the company’s global R&D budget - $227 million in 2015 - is for automotive research.  \"ArcelorMittal's current and emerging catalogue of automotive products and solutions supports carmakers in optimising vehicle weight and cost, while meeting stringent safety standards. We are also committed to manufacturing products that advance sustainable lifestyles. Steel helps cars to be lighter, which reduces carbon emissions, but it is also infinitely and easily recyclable. Additionally, compared to competing materials, steel has a significantly smaller environmental footprint.” concluded Mr. Aranha.

{"id":6311,"text":"Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, ArcelorMittal Chairman and CEO, said:  “Our third quarter results reflect the progress the Company is making to improve the underlying performance of the business, as well as improved market conditions since the start of the year. Despite seasonally lower shipments, EBITDA improved compared with both the second quarter and the same period of 2015.  Looking ahead, while real demand remains stable, we will be impacted by the unexpected significant increase in the price of coal. While expectations are for steel prices to align with the increased costs, in the interim the higher coal price will impact steel spreads and fourth quarter performance.   Overcapacity remains a concern, reinforcing the importance of a comprehensive trade response to minimise the impact of unfair trade across all product categories. But overall we remain pleased with the progress we have made this year. We are supported by a strong balance sheet, we have seen positive price momentum in our main markets and the organisation is fully aligned to successfully implement our five year strategic plan, Action 2020.”  Third quarter 2016 earnings analyst conference call  ### ArcelorMittal management will host a conference call for members of the investment community to discuss the third quarter period ended September 30, 2016 on:  Date | US Eastern time | London | CET   ---|---|---|---   Friday July 29, 2016 |  9.30am |  2.30pm |  3.30pm   The dial in numbers:   Location | Toll free dial in numbers | Local dial in numbers | Participant   UK local: | 0800 051 5931 | +44 (0)203 364 5807 | 06718751#   USA local: | 1 86 6719 2729  |  +1 24 0645 0345 | 06718751#   US (New York) | 1 86 6719 2729  | \\+ 1 64 6663 7901 | 06718751#   France: | 0800 914 780  | +33 1 70 71 29 16 | 06718751#   Germany: | 0800 965 6288 | +49 692 7134 0801 | 06718751#   Spain: | 90 099 4930 |  +34 911 143 436 | 06718751#   Luxembourg: | 800 26908 | +352 27 86 05 07 | 06718751#   A replay of the conference call will be available for one week by dialing:   Number | Language | Access code |    +49 (0) 1805 2047 088 | English | 493108# |","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2016-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal reports third quarter 2016 results","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (referred to as “ArcelorMittal” or the “Company”) (MT (New York, Amsterdam, Paris, Luxembourg), MTS (Madrid)), the world’s leading integrated steel and mining company, today announced results[1] for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-reports-third-quarter-2016-results\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6315,"text":"The formation of STEELCAME, in which ArcelorMittal will hold a 35 per cent shareholding, with the Cellino Group holding the remaining 65 per cent, concludes ArcelorMittal’s search for a strategic partner for its SoluStil business to strengthen the competitiveness of the business, which has been under pressure in recent years due to the highly challenging market in which it operates.      STEELCAME’s assets will consist of four former SoluStil sites in the Rhône-Alpes region, namely La Boisse, Trévoux, Arnas, Montélier, together with Stalobrex, a Polish steel processing business owned by ArcelorMittal. The Cellino Group will contribute two assets to the JV, the Italian company Intek, and the Polish company SHL, both of them active in steel processing and steel components manufacturing.      Commenting, Vijay Goyal, CEO, ArcelorMittal Distribution Solutions, said:      “I am very pleased that we have been able to finalise this joint venture agreement. It concludes our search for a strategic partner for our SoluStil business and I am confident that in the Cellino Group we have found the right partner to strengthen the business and improve its operational and financial performance. This deal safeguards the future of SoluStil’s business and its workforce. Significant synergies exist between the two businesses and combining the various assets in a joint venture will facilitate knowledge exchange, investment, enhanced customer service levels and enable STEELCAME to develop its customer base.”      Fabrizio Cellino, C.E.O. Cellino group, added:      “I’m proud of and strongly motivated by the final creation of this JV between ArcelorMittal Distribution Solutions and the Cellino Group. Assets respectively contributed by the two partners to the newly founded STEELCAME will guarantee a wide and diverse portfolio of industrial processes and technologies that are able to satisfy customers’ needs in a multitude of industries.

{"id":6325,"text":"The investments, two focused on further improvements in the company’s environmental performance and a third project designed to modernize the production of one of the steel plant’s key products, bring total investments in ArcelorMittal Zenica to more than €160m, including €50m targeted specifically for environmental improvements.   Prior to ArcelorMittal’s arrival in Zenica in 2004, the steel plant had been largely out of operation since 1992, with little or no investment made at the factory for several decades.  ArcelorMittal Zenica is the first steel plant in the world to have industrial-scale hybrid filtration technology installed in its sinter plant. A total of €3m has been invested in the new technology, which has cut dust emissions significantly, to well below the EU limit of 20 mg\/Nm3. The company plans to install a second filter, so that both sinter plant stacks’ dust emissions are filtered.   The filter technology is the culmination of a major collaboration between Danish global engineering company FLSmidth and ArcelorMIttal’s R&D team, with a team of seven researchers and six technicians working on the design and testing stages of the project. It is to the credit of the teams involved that the project went from concept to industrialisation within two years.    ArcelorMittal signed a collaboration agreement with FLSmidth to build a pilot plant for the filter in Gijón, Spain, as well as to work together on adapting the technology – which was originally developed for cement plants – to work in sinter plants, which convert iron ore into sinter feed which is then used in the blast furnace.  In addition, ArcelorMittal is installing the technology in its operations in Dąbrowa Górnicza, Poland, while a third installation in Gent, Belgium, is also in progress.   Speaking about the filter innovation, Pinakin Chaubal, head of process R&D at ArcelorMittal, said:  “I’m extremely proud of the team involved in this project, which sets a new global standard for sinter plant emissions. The installation of the hybrid filter in ArcelorMittal Zenica is an important milestone in the project which has involved our R&D team, ArcelorMittal technical specialists, and ArcelorMittal sites in Bosnia & Herzegovina and Spain. I would also like to thank FLSmidth for their highly professional collaboration on this innovative development.”  New technology has also been introduced to achieve major reductions in smoke and gas emissions from ArcelorMittal Zenica’s coke battery. The smokeless charging car, a €4.2m investment, cuts charging times, delivering an almost smoke-free charging process and prevents CO2 emissions being released into the atmosphere. The technology was provided by the UK engineering firm John M. Henderson Machines.   A team of JMH Machines engineers supervised the testing of the mechanical, electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic systems on the ground level, before the 126-tonne car was lifted in one piece into position on the coke oven battery.  New product range  An investment of €5.2m has also been made, to make ArcelorMittal Zenica the first plant in ArcelorMittal Europe to produce rebar in coil.   This is one of ArcelorMittal Zenica’s most important products, which offers customers efficiencies in terms of cutting down on wastage and storage space, and annual production capacity will be raised from 300,000 to 320,000 tonnes, while introducing improvements in the product quality and range, ease of storage and delivery. Italy’s SMS Meer provided and installed the equipment for this production improvement.   “This will improve ArcelorMittal’s competitive edge in an important market sector,” said ArcelorMittal Zenica CEO Mr Biju Nair.   Speaking at the ceremony in Zenica, Mr Nair continued:  “The three important new investment programmes that we are announcing today represent another practical demonstration of our strong commitment to building a long term, sustainable future for steelmaking in this historic industrial city.   Mr Biju Nair addresses delegates at Friday's inauguration ceremony  “To be sustainable, we must pay attention to improving our environmental footprint, and the efficient production of high quality products that meet the expectations of our customers.

{"id":6328,"text":"The theme for this year’s Health and Safety Day, which is co-ordinated with the steel industry’s Steel Safety Day, is ’Sharing and learning from serious occurrences’. These are defined as health and safety contraventions which either did, or importantly could have resulted in severe, or even fatal injuries. Blue and white collar employees will take part not only in discussions, presentations and practical activities to help them identify and prevent unsafe situations, but also a range of health related lifestyle activities.  While many ArcelorMittal sites have been without a fatality or lost time injury for several years, the company has not yet reached its goal of zero injuries and fatalities. However, over the past 11 years the company has made considerable progress in improving safety performance, reducing its lost-time injury frequency rates (LTIFR) from 3.1 in 2007, to 0.82 in 2016. This compares favourably with a World Steel Association average of 1.2. The company is determined to further reduce health and safety occurrences in pursuit of this goal.  Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, will speak to ArcelorMittal employees and contractors around the world today about this year’s theme, pointing out that zero accidents and fatalities are possible, evidenced by the excellent records of many ArcelorMittal plants.  Commenting, he said:  “Since the foundation of ArcelorMittal more than 10 years ago, health and safety has been our number one priority. Our annual health and safety day again focusses us on that. Our aim is to eradicate all accidents, and so we must continue to identify and respond to serious occurrences and ensure the learning from them is shared across the organisation.

The most notable of these investments is the reline of the blast furnace. Completion of this project has allowed the plant a new life for the next 20 years, preserving jobs not only in the Krakow unit, but also in numerous contracting companies as well as industries related to the steel industry, such as mining, gas, energy and transport.

Transaction highlights and key details of AM Investco’s plans for Ilva include:    * Purchase price of €1.8 billion, with annual leasing costs of €180 million to be paid in quarterly installments. Ilva’s assets will be initially leased by AM Investco, with rental payments qualifying as down payments against the purchase price. Start of lease expected around year-end 2017, subject to regulatory authorisations. Lease period to be minimum of two years.   * Investments of c. €2.4 billion (c. €2.1 billion net of Riva Group contribution) over a seven-year period:   * Industrial CAPEX of c. €1.3 billion, supporting an extensive industrial plan; investment programme focussed on blast furnaces, steel shops and finishing lines   * Environmental CAPEX of c. €1.1 billion that will ensure Ilva complies with the Integrated Environmental Authorisation (AIA) as set out by the Italian Government and will materially improve Ilva’s environmental performance in areas including air emissions and water treatment; environmental CAPEX includes remediation spend of €288 million, which will be funded with funds seized by the Italian Government from the Riva Group, Ilva’s former owners; further intention to introduce breakthrough low-carbon technologies, including carbon capture and re-use, in the future; and commitment to use DRI when there are the conditions of economic sustainability coherent with the industrial plan.    * Finished steel shipments to systematically increase to 9.5 million tonnes, by 2023. Crude steel production limited to 6 million tonnes per annum until AIA provisions complied with; once achieved, commitment to restart blast furnace #5 and increase crude steel production to 8 million tonnes per annum; crude steel production to be supplemented by imported slabs and hot rolled coil, in order to maximise utilisation of Ilva’s finishing facilities, with a commitment to keep at least 10,000 employees for the entire duration of the industrial plan according to the outcome of negotiations with the unions.    * €10 million start-up investment in new research and development (R&D) centre in Taranto, which will initially focus on ensuring a successful deployment of the industrial, environment and commercial plans, while also ensuring a smooth transfer of ArcelorMittal R&D intellectual property and knowledge to enhance operationally efficiency, quality and productivity at all Ilva plants.   * The assets will be transferred to AM Investco free of long term liabilities and financial debt and includes €1 billion of net working capital.    Strategic rationale    * Ilva represents a unique opportunity to add significant value to ArcelorMittal’s European business   * Ilva is the largest, and only integrated, steelmaker in Italy. Its main production facility in Taranto is strategically well located, sitting next to one of Europe’s largest deep-water ports, hence enabling easy access to raw materials. Ilva also has significant steel finishing capacity, in Taranto, Novi Ligure and Genova   * It provides ArcelorMittal with a primary production presence in Italy, Europe’s second largest steel consuming market, and a country in which the Company currently has no primary steelmaking capacity   * Italy imports between 60 and 70% of its flat steel requirements, in part due to a decline in Ilva’s output because of numerous commercial, quality and environmental issues it has faced in the recent past; ArcelorMittal believes that, over time, Ilva’s production levels and competitiveness can be restore   * ArcelorMittal can accelerate Ilva’s turnaround through:   * Leveraging ArcelorMittal’s high-added value product range, particularly in the automotive market, and upgrading Ilva’s production facilities in order to extend and improve its product range   * Leveraging economies of scale benefits in areas including procurement   * Opportunity to benchmark against ArcelorMittal’s best performing plants and transfer knowledge and expertise to improve Ilva’s operational performance, quality and efficiency   * Leveraging ArcelorMittal’s world-class research and development offering, and rapidly deploy steelmaking process and product solutions at Ilva   * Capturing €310 million of identified synergies.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal led consortium reaches agreement regarding Ilva lease and purchase agreement","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) and Marcegaglia announce that AM Investco Italy Srl (‘AM Investco’) has concluded the exclusive negotiation phase and reached a binding agreement concerning the lease and obligation to purchase Ilva S.p.A and its subsidiaries with the Italian Government.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-led-consortium-reaches-agreement\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6345,"text":"In Florange, eastern France, €67m will be invested in a new production line for automotive steels. This project is part of the company’s strategy to have a centre of excellence for automotive steels production in the Lorraine region: Florange and Mouzon in France, and Dudelange in Luxembourg.  The investment will see the construction of a new 600,000 tonne Usibor® line in Florange, which will be operational by mid-2019 and is expected to employ 75 people of which 20 will be newly created jobs. This line will be dedicated to producing advanced high strength steels (AHSS) for the automotive industry and will replace the current electro-galvanising line.  The new line, which will be integrated with a hot strip mill and a pickling line, will be able to produce steels such as Usibor® 2000 and Ductibor® 1000 as well as a new Usibor® Ultraprotect coating. This builds on Florange’s strong reputation for Usibor®.  The line also strengthens ArcelorMittal’s position in advanced high strength steels for the automotive industry, which has been a focus of its R&D efforts. This has led to the design of Usibor® 2000, which the group is soon to produce on an industrial scale. The line will put ArcelorMittal in a strong position to meet fast-growing demand for Usibor®.  In parallel, customer demand for electrogalvanised products is shrinking, as they opt for more advanced high-strength steels. As a result, the current electro-zinc coating line in Florange has been operating below its 300,000 tonne capacity and ArcelorMittal has decided to convert this line into a Usibor® line. Demand for electrogalvanised products will be met by ArcelorMittal’s three other electrogalvanising lines within northern Europe: Marchin and Genk in Belgium and Dudelange, Luxembourg.  “This investment will mean better service for our customers thanks to our increased ability to produce advanced high strength steels, and the flexibility that this additional capacity brings. As we develop new advanced high strength steel products, we want to be in a position to produce them commercially as soon as possible and this investment puts us in a strong position to be able to do this. This is another very positive development in the recent history of ArcelorMittal in Lorraine – and Florange was the right place to make this investment, with its strategic location, with the technology it already has, and its existing infrastructure” said Wim Van Gerven, CEO of Business Division North.  Greater flexibility for high value-added products from Dunkerque  At Dunkerque, ArcelorMittal will invest €29m in the plant's steel shop, to deliver technical improvements that will provide greater flexibility for high value-added products.  The vacuum degassing unit will be modified, adding steel desulphurisation, and a better slag retention system will be installed on the converters. These projects will be operational in the fourth quarter of 2018.  These investments will increase the steel shop's ability to produce grades with very low sulphur, phosphorus and nitrogen contents, in line with the requirements of automotive customers in particular. Therefore, Usibor® 2000, awaited by customers, will go into industrial production at Dunkerque in 2019.  “These investments are wholly in line with the strategy of ArcelorMittal Atlantique & Lorraine. This is an important step in our plan to reach our performance objectives over the long term: enhanced efficiency, quality and customer service” emphasised Eric Niedziela, CEO of ArcelorMittal Atlantique & Lorraine.  Usibor® and Ductibor® -- meeting the challenges of the automotive industry  Advanced high strength steels such as Usibor and Ductibor mainly serve the automotive market. They feature in structural parts of vehicles where they enhance safety (crash behaviour) while enabling weight reduction, thus reducing fuel consumption and emissions. Usibor and Ductibor customers include a vast majority of carmakers around the world.  Florange at the cutting edge for automotive steels since 2013  In 2013, ArcelorMittal announced the launch of the first line in the world to produce extra-wide Usibor® for the automotive industry, in Florange.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal invests €96m in Florange and Dunkerque","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal is to invest €96m at its Florange and Dunkerque sites in France.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-jul-28-arcelormittal-invests-96m-in-florange-and-dunkerque\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Matthieu is currently CEO of the ArcelorMittal Gent cluster in Belgium, which shipped over 6.5 million tonnes of steel in 2016. He was originally appointed CEO of ArcelorMittal Gent in January 2014 and took responsibility for the Gent cluster, which includes ArcelorMittal’s operations in Liège, upon its creation in 2016.

Commenting, Matthieu Jehl said:  “The turnaround of Ilva is integral to the future of Italy’s manufacturing sector and I am very excited to have been tasked with this important responsibility. One of the first things I plan to do is meet stakeholders, to ensure that we understand their perspective and that they understand our plans and investment commitments, which are considerable. Having been CEO of steelmaking operations of significant scale in Belgium, I know that it is not enough to meet industrial targets – we also have to meet the expectations of our stakeholders, and certainly of the employees. In recent years Ilva has lost its licence to operate – regaining this is a clear priority and this can only be achieved through transparent, honest and regular dialogue. I have been following the situation closely for some time and am confident that Ilva will regain its position as a tier one steel producer, capable of providing Italian and European customers with the quality and service they require. The opportunities are considerable and I am looking forward to getting started.”  Samuele Pasi added:  “As an Italian native and someone who has been involved in the Ilva tender process for a number of years, I am well aware of the strategic importance of Ilva to the fabric of Italy’s manufacturing sector.   “ArcelorMittal’s credentials as the world’s leading steel company, and as a committed and trustworthy investor, became very clear to me in the advisory role I undertook for the company.

{"id":6352,"text":"The programme is designed to enable ArcelorMittal Mexico to meet the anticipated increased demand requirements from domestic customers, realise in full ArcelorMittal Mexico’s productive capacity of 5.3 million tonnes and significantly enhance the proportion of higher-value added products in its product mix, in-line with the Company’s Action 2020 strategic plan.  The main investment will be construction of a new hot strip mill. Construction will take approximately three years and, upon completion, will enable ArcelorMittal Mexico to produce c. 2.5 million tonnes of flat rolled steel. Coils from the new hot strip mill will be supplied to domestic, non-auto, general industry customers. Further investments will be made at Lázaro Cárdenas to improve the quality and productivity of the asset base, with additional investment in the group’s Mexican mining operations.  Today’s announcement follows confirmation that the Mexican government has established five Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in southern Mexico to attract infrastructure investment in areas of undeveloped economic potential. Lázaro Cárdenas, home to ArcelorMittal Mexico’s primary steelmaking operations, was named a SEZ.  Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “In order to make investment decisions of the scale we have announced today we need both a favourable investment environment and confidence in long-term domestic growth prospects. I therefore warmly welcome the confirmation of the Special Economic Zones by the Mexican government, which establishes a positive regulatory investment framework aimed at facilitating economic and infrastructure development in the south of the country. Our investment programme is aligned with the Mexican government’s objectives, and will enable us to benefit from the anticipated increased demand for higher-added value steel products from domestic Mexican customers. It reinforces our long-standing presence in Mexico, will support the creation of approximately 800 new jobs and play an important role in bolstering economic activity in the region.”  Victor Cairo, CEO, ArcelorMittal Mexico, added:  “Construction of the new hot strip mill, alongside the other projects in our investment programme which are geared towards enhancing the efficiency and quality of our operations, will enable us to optimise our asset base and increase the proportion of finished steel products for our domestic customers. The investments will help us to meet the demand requirements for higher-added value products we expect to see from domestic customers, which today are heavily dependent on imports, while continuing to support ArcelorMittal’s NAFTA operations by providing high-quality semi-finished steel slabs.”  ArcelorMittal Mexico currently produces c. 4 million tonnes of steel a year. Following completion of the investment programme, production would be optimised to c. 5.3 million tonnes per year, with the proportion of finished steel for the domestic Mexican market significantly expanded. Flat rolled steel production would total c. 2.5 million tonnes, long steel c. 1.8 million tonnes with the remaining 1 million tonnes made up of semi-finished slabs.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal announces US$1.0 billion three-year investment programme in Mexico","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces a major US$1 billion, three-year investment programme at its Mexican operations, which is focussed on building ArcelorMittal Mexico’s downstream capabilities, sustaining the competitiveness of its mining operations and modernising its existing asset base.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-announces-us-1-0-billion-three-year\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6353,"text":"The day’s activities, organised in partnership with the Museum of Metallurgy, included a tour of the plant’s facilities, exhibitions, presentations on several topics including electrical steels, industry trade, plant’s history, as well as an information stand set up by an engineering school to give insight into the applications of electrical steels.  The plant specialises in electrical steels for a number of industries, including energy (hydropower, wind, nuclear, etc.), industrial motors, consumer goods (household appliances and tools), and the automotive sector, supplying high-grade products for electric and hybrid vehicles. The plant supplies some 150 customers across the world, with 75% of the products exported, 25% out of Europe.  Investing in the future of the plant and the community  In 2013 the plant commissioned a new continuous annealing production line, an investment worth €90 million. Furthermore, in May this year, the company announced a new €5.6 million investment plan that should allow recovery and use of the heat generated in the production process. The project, done in collaboration with Kyotherm, Schneider Electric, and the town of Saint-Chély-d'Apcher, should enable the plant to save 4,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions per year, equivalent to taking 2,000 new vehicles off the road.   “We have been able to adopt a new course in recent years following the investment made in 2013. We are guided solely by our customers’ requirements and have become pioneers in Europe,\" said Gilles Hoffmann, ArcelorMittal Saint-Chély-d'Apcher plant director.   “This plant has a bright future ahead of it with the development of high-end steels for the automotive industry,” said Bernard Dehut, ArcelorMittal Méditerranée CEO.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Saint-Chély-d'Apcher celebrates a century of steelmaking excellence","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Saint-Chély-d'Apcher, France, celebrated 100 years of operations at an open day event held on 23 September and attended by more than 2,700 guests.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-sep-28-saint-chely-d-apcher-celebrates-a-century-of-steelmaking-excellence\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6354,"text":"ArcelorMittal Tubarão, Brazil, has won the worldsteel Steelie Award in the ‘Excellence in Sustainability’ category for its efforts to pave rural roads in Brazil using steel by-products.  The ‘Excellence in sustainability’ award acknowledges the sustainability initiative which has made the greatest contribution to all three areas of sustainability – economic, environmental and social value. The winners of the 8th Steelie Awards were announced at the Annual Dinner of the World Steel Association (worldsteel) on 16 October.  Tubarão’s accolade-winning project is a result of ArcelorMittal R&D department’s ground breaking work on developing REVSOL® and REVSOL Plus®, products which turn steel slag into a primary road, car park and storage yard coating, replacing the use of non-renewable sources in road building and significantly reducing the need for road maintenance and the costs associated with it.   Paving what had been dirt roads has also improved access to services such as garbage collection, ambulances, and police for 30 municipalities in the state of Espirito Santo over a 200km radius. It has reduced maintenance costs for the vehicles which use these better-quality roads and has speeded up delivery of local produce, improving the quality of life for local people, and achieving better prices for small farmers whose produce is fresher and more saleable when it reaches consumers.  ArcelorMittal Acindar, Argentina, was shortlisted in the same category, for a project which built a secure breeding centre for the conservation of jaguars out of reused steel.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Two awards in two days for ArcelorMittal","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal takes home the ‘Excellence in Sustainability’ Steelie Award from worldsteel; silver in ‘Best online annual report’ category at the 2017 Digital Impact Awards","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-oct-18-two-awards-in-two-days-for-arcelormittal\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6359,"text":"Speaking at the company's Europe media day in Paris today, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe and group CFO, said:  \"2017 has been a milestone year for digitalisation within the company. While the company has had a digital focus for a number of years, benefiting customers in particular, ArcelorMittal is today making major investments, not only in terms of resources but also in time and in management attention, to remain at the forefront of digitalisation in the steel industry\".  Explaining at the company's Europe media day why the opportunities from digitalisation and Industry 4.0 are so rapidly accelerating, Wim Van Gerven, management committee member responsible for digital transformation for industry, and CEO of business division north, ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, explained:  \"ArcelorMittal isn't new to digitalisation, commercial or industrial. We've been deploying it for years to improve our processes: our assets are already highly automated and in many cases, connected. But the pace of change is what's new, we're no longer having to wait two to three years for prototypes to be developed and tested - it's happening in a matter of months\".  Changes such as the affordability of sensors – which are used in their thousands through ArcelorMittal's plants - and the ability to use big data to process huge volumes of data generated from sensors, are creating possibilities that did not exist two years ago.  Creating centres of excellence across Europe  Recognising the benefits of collaboration on such projects, the company has created centres of digital excellence in Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Poland and Spain, where new technologies are developed from prototype to maturity:  \"Today, if you go to our facilities around the world, especially in Europe, you will see small clusters of people working together in finding solutions. To imagine a steel company of this size, to be addressing these challenges in a start-up style, is quite exciting. Most people who join the steel business would not expect to have such opportunities at ArcelorMittal. This is exciting for existing employees as well as for new employees\" said Aditya Mittal.  Earlier this month, ArcelorMittal Poland announced the creation of ArcelorMittal Poland Research & Innovation, to lead and encourage multi-functional teams to launch new digitalisation and Industry 4.0 initiatives, with a focus on competitiveness and industry leadership.  ArcelorMittal's R&D centre in Avilés, Spain – recently renamed the Global R&D Aviles Innovation Island Centre - is one of the principal centres of excellence for digitalisation and Industry 4.0 within the ArcelorMittal group. The group's engineers, scientists and analysts based in the centre focus on the development of breakthrough technologies.  As an extension of its certified SAP Centre of Excellence in Luxembourg, ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products has decided to create in Olaberria, Spain, a small Digital Competence Centre, working with the new agile methodologies and cloud technologies (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure), helping the business around web and mobile services.  In ArcelorMittal Gent, Belgium, more than 100 engineers have teamed up to work on accelerating the plant's automation projects, and to support on rolling out the technology across the group. In addition, a team of 70 systems and modelling experts has been formed, with engineers from across ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products' industrial sites working together.  In France, ArcelorMittal's Downstream Solutions business is creating a digital headquarters, with a small, start-up team of digital specialists based in the company's Distribution Solutions headquarters in Reims, France. The team has worked on initiatives including the company's first online steel shop.  On the commercial side of the business, a small team of data scientists has been hired in Luxembourg to further drive commercial digitalisation initiatives, in addition to the 20-strong team that has been implementing digital transformation for customers for a number of years.  ArcelorMittal is also working with leading universities in Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, the UK and USA to capture the best academic expertise and implement new ideas in the business.  For example, In Luxembourg, ArcelorMittal Europe - Long Products' R&D team is working with the Luxembourg Institute for Science and Technology.  It has also established partnerships with a number of start-up companies, working on topics including additive manufacturing, big data analytics and manufacturing intelligence.  Digitalisation drivers  The main driver for digitalisation at ArcelorMittal is competitive advantage, with new technologies helping to ensure:    * customers' product needs can be met straight away, for example through the company's 'virtual mill' which connects all Flat Products mills, systems, and order books, to removes all boundaries, whether geographical or technical.   * the best product quality, through better prediction using advanced analytics made possible through big data and distributed computing. This means production issues can be detected before they happen, allowing the early detection of defects.   * cost efficiency in production and logistics. For example, the company's R&D sites in Avilés, Spain has developed a unique, breakthrough technology for line scheduling – inspired by studying and mimicking the movements in ant colonies - that has significantly improved productivity. And the deployment of automated stockyards, linked to line scheduling and transport devices such as autonomous cranes means less stock is needed, and lead times are cut: two major supply chain benefits.    Driving the change  Customers are also driving change within ArcelorMittal's plants, for example with digital twinning. Digital twinning involves building virtual models of physical assets or manufacturing processes that continually learn and provide data insights.  On its production lines that supply the automotive industry, ArcelorMittal uses digital twinning to create a digital fingerprint of a coil that's scheduled for delivery.  Quality defects are marked with a barcode on the coil and linked to a digital twin of the coil in the cloud.  Customers can then automatically scan the bar codes when the coil arrives, access the quality data from the cloud and optimise their operations with the knowledge downloaded from the bar code.  By knowing where the issues with the coil are in advance, this helps to eliminate waste and optimize productivity for both supplier and customer.  The benefits of a large-scale company  While the implementation of such large-scale digital and industry 4.0 projects is challenging in a company of ArcelorMittal's size, once implemented these projects bring major benefits and value exactly because of the company's scale and complexity:  \"Digitalisation at the world's largest steel and mining company isn't straightforward, but once we harness the volumes of data generated by our plants, we stand to make a huge leap in terms of the benefits of digitalisation for our manufacturing processes, and for our customers\" said Wim Van Gerven.  Cultural change  Recognising the scale of the cultural change taking place as a result of the focus on digitalisation, Wim Van Gerven also spoke about the company's human resources strategy for developing employees' skills in this respect:  \"Cultural change within the company is as important as the digital changes themselves – digital transformation is a process that impacts the entire company and we are acutely aware of the need to ensure cultural change in our workforce, in order for our employees to have the right mindset to help ensure our digital ambitions are fully realized\", he explained.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe leads the future of steel with digitalisation investments and centres of excellence for new technology","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe is investing in digitalisation throughout its business - in a year when rapid developments in technology have reached a tipping point.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-nov-28-arcelormittal-europe-leads-the-future-of-steel\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6361,"text":"By collaborating with internal experts, those from academia and its customers, ArcelorMittal is finding ways to make transformational changes to the way it does business, as it seeks to achieve its ambition of becoming a zero-waste company. Some of the ways it is doing this, acknowledged by the commendation, include:    * Partnering with technical and industry leaders to develop and scale up ground-breaking carbon capture and utilisation technology, resulting in products like Steelanol, a bio-fuel made from waste carbon monoxide, with the help of microbes. This high-grade ethanol will then be used for transportation and to make plastics. The company anticipates Steelanol could create 2000 direct and indirect jobs and generate an income of 300 million euro a year by 2025, while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions – 5 million tonnes worth a year by 2025.   * Manufacturing ECOCEM, a low carbon cement, from its slag and selling it directly to customers. In France alone, this practice has already reduced the cement industry’s CO2 emissions by nearly two million tonnes, and from 2018 onwards it is projected to further reduce those emissions by a further one million tonnes a year. Selling this by-product generates over 100 million euro in revenue each year.   * Paving more than 650 km of country roads across 20 Brazilian municipalities with over 1.5 million tonnes of Revsol and Revsol Plus. These products, made from slag, a by-product of the steelmaking process, replace natural non-renewable resources such as gravel.   * Allocating additional resources to detailed life cycle assessment of its products and developing a new sustainability assessment tool.   * Designing innovative processes and products to maximise efficiency and minimise waste in its own production and those of its customers.   * Stretching product lifecycles by leasing sheet piles for short term projects, rather than selling them – and then leasing them again. The company’s comparative studies show reusing sheet piles has 86% less global warming potential than permanent steel sheet piles and 90% less global warming potential than a concrete retaining wall.   Similarly, through the circular building, exhibited at the London Design Festival 2016, the company demonstrated the concept of steel reuse for entire steel structures, given they are designed, dismantled and reused with the circular economy in mind.   * Torrefing waste wood and using it to replace coal in its blast furnaces, harnessing and using energy that would otherwise have been lost. In doing so, the company expects to recycle two to four million tonnes of waste wood each year by 2025, saving it approximately 100 million euro a year.   * The Circulars 2018, an initiative of The World Economic Forum and The Forum of Young Global Leaders, run in collaboration with Accenture Strategy and given at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos. The award recognises individuals and organisations from around the world who are making notable contributions to the circular economy.    Alan Knight, General manager, head of corporate responsibility and sustainable development said, “Being highly commended by the Circulars 2018, is a fantastic achievement and highlights how far we have come as a steel company to change not only the way we do things, but also the way we are perceived as a corporate citizen. We have long talked about the value steel brings to people’s lives and its unparalleled recyclability, but now we are finding ways to take those ideas further and become a zero-waste company by integrating circular economy principles into everything we do.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal gets nod from World Economic Forum for integrating circular economy principles into its business model","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"The world’s most prestigious award programme for the circular economy, The Circulars, has highly commended ArcelorMittal for demonstrating leadership and innovation by applying circular economy principles to its business models.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-dec-7-arcelormittal-gets-nod-from-world-economic-forum\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6363,"text":"The ambitious winning design - which was unveiled in Kirchberg, Luxembourg today - is primarily steel and glass, and will showcase the diverse benefits of steel over other building materials* in addition to highlighting the use of steel in ‘green’, sustainable construction. As well as being ArcelorMittal’s headquarters, housing around 800 employees, some of the space will be leased for other uses. There will also be a restaurant, sports facility and a 200-seat auditorium available to the public.  W&A’s design responds to a detailed brief to design a modern, sustainable building that harnesses all the potential of steel from top to bottom. The result is a truly unique building that includes numerous design firsts, including innovative new products and features that are the result of a close collaboration between the designer and ArcelorMittal’s research and development teams. Technical innovations include:    * A fluid and flexible ground floor space featuring no columns, a feature that is only possible with steel due to the use of a suspended steel exoskeleton   * An integrated flooring system fully designed in steel which removes the need for false ceilings, resulting in high quality acoustics and improved aesthetics   * A curtain wall completely designed in steel which results in a lighter, more airy building due to steel’s higher strength and superior elasticity   * New section bars adapted from products designed for the automotive sector    The W&A design also responds to ArcelorMittal’s desire to have a sustainable building that promotes steel’s contribution to the circular economy. The building follows the “cradle-to-cradle” concept, meaning that it can be dismantled and nearly all the steel products re-used in a new building without the need for recycling.  The building is also a low-carbon, energy-efficient building and will be “BREEAM outstanding,” “DGNB Gold,” and “BBCA” certified. Environmental credentials include solar power generation – featuring 4000 square metres of ArcelorMIttal steel photo voltaic cells on the roof - rain water management, and automatic window opening for natural ventilation. It also features a bioclimatic public atrium, ventilated by a Canadian well system, which naturally cools the air in summer and heats it in winter. The atrium is designed to evoke the Luxembourg countryside and will feature trees and plants in a woodland style that will bring additional environmental benefits, acting as a buffer for the temperature. Further green space will be created by setting the building back from the limit of the plot, creating new outdoor public spaces. The building will also be certified by a Gold level “WELL” label. All of these features will serve to underpin ArcelorMittal’s commitment to sustainable development (SD) as encapsulated in our 10 SD outcomes, which are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Today’s announcement demonstrates in particular our commitment to creating sustainable infrastructure, our SD outcome 3 (aligned with SDG 11), and our determination to become a responsible energy user that contributes to a low carbon future – our SD outcome 6 (aligned with SDG 13).  Speaking in Luxembourg at an event to announce the winner, Aditya Mittal, chairman of the jury, said: “Taking the decision to invest in a new headquarters shows ArcelorMittal’s long-term commitment to Luxembourg. As the world’s leading steel company, it is also a great opportunity to have a new headquarters that showcases the flexibility, creativity and sustainability of steel as a construction material. All the architects that participated in the competition submitted interesting designs and on behalf of my colleagues on the jury, I would like to thank them all for their creativity. Ultimately though we could only select one project and W&A stood out for their complete respect of every aspect of our brief, including practicality, aesthetics, economics and sustainability, as well as their enthusiastic engagement with our R&D team. They have developed a truly innovative design. What I personally love is that this building shows the beauty of steel, which is so often hidden from view. In fact, we believe that no other building of this size and scale has been designed specifically to feature steel throughout. And, equally important, it will be a great place to work for our employees, a fantastic platform to show our customers what steel can do and an exceptional open space for visitors to this part of the city.”  Jean-Michel Wilmotte, Architect, President of W&A, said: “To be asked to design a new steel-based headquarters for the world’s leading steel company is an important commission. I love working with steel and am confident that we have developed a design that will showcase the very best of the material. I am particularly excited about the ambition of the building, which is to show how creativity, coupled with modern techniques, can advance the sustainability, economics, and practicality of modern office building design and so improve the lives of those who work and interact with it. I hope that the employees of ArcelorMittal will be proud of the building and will enjoy coming to work there for many years and decades to come.”  Michel Wurth, President of ArcelorMittal Luxembourg, added: “As a Luxemburger, I’m proud and excited that such a forward-thinking design will be built here largely with steel made in Luxembourg. Our steel features in so many iconic buildings around the world, it’s great to have an opportunity to create another one here in our home country. I believe W&A’s design fully captures the atmosphere of tomorrow which is appropriate for ArcelorMittal as a company on the cutting edge of its industry and will also provide a great place for our employees to work. It will be a new addition to the Kirchberg plateau and of course we will work closely work with the municipality of Luxembourg during the planning phase to fully integrate this new building into the already iconic urban landscape and skyline.“  The consultation was initiated in February 2017 following ArcelorMittal’s decision in April 2016 to build a new head office in Luxembourg. ArcelorMittal is the principal industrial employer of the Grand Duchy with over 4,000 employees. The construction of a new, landmark headquarters building illustrates the Group’s commitment to maintaining its presence in the country, where the company has not only its head offices, but also seven industrial sites producing or processing steel, and developing steel solutions for the construction, automotive, general industry and agriculture sectors of the economy.  In the first phase, eight internationally renowned practices were invited to submit initial designs on April 27 and 28. Bernard Tschumi Architects, Foster + Partners, JSWD Architekten, Massimiliano Fuksas Architecture, Rafael Vinoly Architects, Rem Koolhaas OMA, Von Gerkan, Marg and Partners and Wilmotte & Associés were the architects included. In the second phase, three shortlisted practices – Foster + Partners, Rem Koolhaas OMA, and Wilmotte & Associés - were asked to develop a more advanced architectural design. These were then submitted to the jury which evaluated the proposals and then recommended Wilmotte & Associés to ArcelorMittal and to the Board of Fonds Kirchberg as the selected winner.  Groundbreaking is expected during the summer of 2019 with completion in the last quarter of 2021  *This includes the ability to include additional storeys without compromising ceiling height, due to reduced floor thicknesses; fewer internal columns due to the strength of the most modern steel beams, permitting more flexible internal layouts; and, due to the lighter weight of steel buildings as opposed to those using conventional materials, less deep foundations, bringing timing and cost benefits. Use of steel also brings efficiency to site operations given that even the most complex forms are pre-fabricated off site and only come to site for assembly. Compared to traditional construction methods, this saves time and manpower on site, and lessens road congestion caused by deliveries.

CAD$30 million) and its Contrecoeur-West bar mill (approx. CAD$33 million). These new furnaces, which aim to increase the company's rolling capacity by 100,000 tonnes, will enable greater productivity, optimal energy use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The work should extend until the first half of 2020.   * At the same time, ArcelorMittal will be replacing the dust collector at the Contrecoeur-West steelworks by the end of 2018 to improve its performance and increase health and safety for the benefit of our workers and our communities. The work will cost approximately CAD$6 million.     The investments were made possible in part by the Québec government’s electricity rebate programme for L-rate customers, announced by the Government of Quebec in the 2016-2017 Budget. This electricity rebate is intended for companies engaging in major investment projects in the manufacturing sector as well as in the transformation of natural resources. ArcelorMittal investment project rebate is currently estimated at CAD$25 million until 2020.   In addition to these announcements, ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada has also invested CAD$27 million in a new finishing line at its Longueuil mill, a project which was completed in June 2017. Past and future work requires support from many suppliers and subcontractors, mostly from local communities, which adds economic benefits.   François Perras, Chief Executive Officer, ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada, said:  “We are renewing ArcelorMittal’s commitment to Quebec. Our choice to invest in the acquisition of high-performance equipment will help us accelerate our move towards high-value-added steel production, particularly for the automotive and construction industries. ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada will also be in a better position to meet its customers’ needs and face international competition. Our workers’ ongoing efforts and government support have been instrumental in this investment decision. With this modernisation plan, we will continue to play a major role in our communities by supporting more than 1,700 direct jobs and converting our natural resources right here in Quebec.”   Dominique Anglade, Deputy Premier, Minister of Economy, Science and Innovation and Minister responsible for the digital strategy, said:  “The innovative manufacturing sector is one of the three economic pillars that our government is prioritising, along with entrepreneurship and exports. We are, therefore, proud to support the initiatives of large businesses established in Québec which, through major investments, are carrying out innovative projects and adopting new technologies in their manufacturing approaches and procedures. Innovation and modernisation are synonymous with growth for businesses and are key levers for Québec’s prosperity.”  Carlos J. Leitão, Minister of Finance, said:  “Québec’s stable business environment, recognised expertise in a number of leading-edge sectors and abundant natural resources make it the ideal place to invest. Today’s announcement clearly demonstrates ArcelorMittal’s interest in expanding its operations in Québec. The confirmation of these strategic investments will bolster and diversify our economy in several of Québec’s regions.”  Image: ArcelorMittal's wire rod mill in Contrecoeur, Quebec  Images for media use: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2DpiJh6  About ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada  ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada’s (http:\/\/long-canada.arcelormittal.com) mission is to safely manufacture sustainable steel in accordance with its values of health and safety, quality, leadership and sustainability.

It also highlights the extensive experience and track record of the group in the successful acquisition and integration of under-performing assets, which AMIPL believes would be of considerable value to Essar. Essar would also have access to the deep bench of technical expertise and knowledge from across the group which is unparalleled in the steel industry.  Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Essar provides a compelling opportunity for ArcelorMittal to enter the high growth Indian steel market. The offer submitted today by AMIPL includes a detailed investment plan to address operational issues in Essar’s existing asset base.

{"id":6372,"text":"The Company’s subsidiary ArcelorMittal India Private Limited (AMIPL) submitted a Resolution Plan for Essar on 12 February, which outlined the intention to have NSSMC formally join its bid for Essar Steel. Should the submitted Resolution Plan be selected and formally accepted by India’s National Company Law Tribunal, ArcelorMittal and NSSMC would jointly acquire and manage Essar Steel.  In its Resolution Plan, AMIPL set out a detailed industrial and turnaround plan aimed at restoring Essar Steel’s fortunes, enabling it to realise its full potential and participate in the anticipated steel demand growth in India.   Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Partnering with NSSMC for Essar Steel was always our intention and adds further strength to our offer. Combining our experience and expertise creates a powerful partnership that has a proven track record - our rich history of positive collaboration dates back more than 20 years with three joint ventures in the US. We believe that together we can contribute our knowledge and technology to support a rapid turn-around in Essar’s performance, enabling it to increase production, enhance its product capabilities and make a meaningful contribution to the future growth of India’s manufacturing sector and the development of its economy.”  ArcelorMittal and NSSMC have operated I\/N Tek and I\/N Kote in Indiana, USA, under joint venture agreements since 1987. I\/N Tek and I\/N Kote are high-added value downstream steel finishing facilities which serve the automotive and domestic appliance markets.  More recently, in 2014, ArcelorMittal partnered with NSSMC on the acquisition of AM\/NS Calvert, a state-of-the art downstream finishing facility in Alabama, USA. The facility, which opened in 2010 and has a 5.3 million tonne capacity, was the largest newly constructed steel facility in the US in 40 years but had failed to reach its potential. A major investment programme has been undertaken following the acquisition. The programme focussed on improving the facility’s finishing lines to enable the production of higher-added value steel products, including production of Usibor®, ArcelorMittal’s flagship advanced high-strength steel for the automotive sector, and increasing slab staging capacity and efficiency. These investments have helped to facilitate a rapid improvement in AM\/NS Calvert’s performance: capacity utilisation rates have improved by over 20 per cent; shipments to the automotive sector more than doubled between 2015 and 2017; and productivity at the hot strip mill has increased by over 1 million tonnes since the acquisition.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2018-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Agreement between ArcelorMittal and NSSMC regarding joint venture to acquire Essar Steel India Limited","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (The Company) has signed a joint venture formation agreement with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (NSSMC) in relation to its offer to acquire Essar Steel India Limited (Essar Steel).","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/agreement-between-arcelormittal-and-nssmc\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6377,"text":"NSSMC is Japan’s leading steel company, with capacity to produce approximately 50 million tons of crude steel per year with a reputation for innovation and high-quality products. ArcelorMittal and NSSMC have enjoyed a close collaboration for many decades co-operating high-quality downstream finishing facilities in the US including I\/N Tek, I\/N Kote and, since 2014, jointly acquired and turned around AM\/NS Calvert which has state-of-the-art facilities in Alabama that had failed to reach its potential under its previous owner.  Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO ArcelorMittal, said:  “The aim of the resolution process is to find a strong, new, capable owner for Essar Steel and maximize returns to creditors. We believe that ArcelorMittal, together with NSSMC, has the most relevant credentials and experience and is the most credible owner for Essar Steel given our decades of steel industry expertise, backed up by industry leading research and development and a wide range of innovative product capabilities.  “We are confident we are eligible; we are confident we have the strongest track record; and we are confident we have made a strong and competitive offer. At the heart of this offer is a compelling industrial plan that enhances and transforms the asset. The plant in Hazira is a big integrated steel-making facility that requires dedicated knowledge and technological expertise to de-bottleneck, grow and enhance its product portfolio. We plan to commit significant capital expenditure to grow the asset, inject our proprietorial patents and processes and bring new high-quality products for industries such as automotive and solar to India.  “India has an ambitious goal to transform its economy and deliver a better standard of living for all its people. Developing its manufacturing industry is an important component of this journey as exemplified by the government’s plan to expand the country’s steelmaking capacity to 300 million tons. Supported by the right know-how and technology, Essar Steel is well positioned to play a part in this. Given our Indian heritage we would be proud to contribute to the country’s future prosperity.”  Mr. Kosei Shindo, President of NSSMC, said:  “India is the most promising steel market in the world, and NSSMC has been seeking opportunities to establish a significant presence in India, motivated by a long and successful history of respect and collaboration between Japan and India. This project, if implemented, will be consistent with the policy of the Japanese Government to further strengthen the relationship between India and Japan. The Japanese Government has been following the project and is looking for its realization.  “Essar Steel is a good asset with a lot of potential and I believe that NSSMC and ArcelorMittal could provide operational experience and access to the best of global technologies that will enable Essar Steel to reach its potential and greatly contribute to the turnaround of the Indian steel manufacturing sector. We believe NSSMC, together with ArcelorMittal, could help India achieve the National Steel Policy as well as the Make-in-India policy, as we have long been contributing to localization of steel production in other countries such as Brazil, USA, and many ASEAN countries by direct investment.  “I believe that the partnership between NSSMC and ArcelorMittal will provide important economic returns to Essar Steel’s creditor banks, while substantially enhancing the prospects for a sustainable turnaround plan for Essar Steel and its employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders.”  AMIPL first submitted a bid for Essar Steel on 12th February.

{"id":6389,"text":"If proved successful, the new concept has the potential to revolutionise blast furnace carbon emissions capture and support the decarbonisation of the transport sector.  The technology in the gas conversion process was pioneered by Chicago-based company, LanzaTech, with whom ArcelorMittal has entered a long-term partnership. The technology licensed by LanzaTech uses microbes that feed on carbon monoxide to produce bioethanol. The bioethanol will be used as transport fuel or potentially in the production of plastics.  This is the first installation of its kind on an industrial scale in Europe and once complete, annual production of bioethanol at Ghent is expected to reach around 80 million litres, which will yield an annual CO2 saving equivalent to putting 100,000 electrical cars on the road. The new installation will create up to 500 construction jobs over the next two years and 20 to 30 new permanent direct jobs. Commissioning and first production is expected by mid-2020.  The application of this microbial gas conversion system significantly advances ArcelorMittal’s carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) capabilities and enhances steel’s role in the circular economy. ArcelorMittal’s long-term aspiration is to become a zero-waste business, with all materials used or generated during steel production recuperated, treated and reused in the production chain or becoming the raw materials for other industries.  \"This new Carbon Smart technology illustrates ArcelorMittal’s commitment to transforming steel production and it will also further strengthen steel’s standing in the circular economy, particularly compared to other higher carbon metals like aluminium.”  \"We are excited that after several years of research and engineering, we are now progressing with the largest project of its kind within the ArcelorMittal group. This is the first application of a viable new business case where re-use of carbon is possible at large scale. We will achieve significant carbon reduction and we hope that this will lead us to a lower carbon economy,\" says Carl De Maré, vice president of Technology Strategy at ArcelorMittal.  \"Single use carbon must become a thing of the past,” said Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech. “In order to succeed in decarbonizing our economy, we will need the commitment of large companies and governments from around the world to ensure carbon reuse is part of the solution.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2018-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal and LanzaTech break ground on €150million project to revolutionise blast furnace carbon emissions capture","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal has begun construction of new premises at its site in Ghent, Belgium, to house a pioneering new installation which will convert carbon-containing gas from its blast furnaces into bioethanol.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2018-jun-11-arcelormittal-and-lanzatech-break-ground-on-150million-project\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6390,"text":"Known as Steligence®, the concept revolves around the idea of buildings as holistic entities where all aspects of design are considered in an integrated way, as part of the whole. As such, it proposes the need for better dialogue between various specialist architectural and engineering disciplines, recognizing not only specialist expertise, but also the need for enhanced co-operation between experts. Steligence® further suggests that the use of best available technology in steelmaking, as well as modularization of steel components in buildings where possible, has the capacity to generate efficiency gains in the design, construction and configurability of buildings as compared to those using traditional construction methods.  Additionally, because steel is infinitely recyclable, Steligence® sets the stage for architects to consider the life-cycle, recyclability and, ultimately, re-usability of a building and its components at the earliest point in the design process.  This new approach to construction from ArcelorMittal has been brought about by real advances in technology which now make steel an even more attractive material for construction than was previously the case. As such, the Steligence® concept has the potential to drive significant architectural and sustainability benefits.  These benefits include more building storeys within a given height than is the case with traditional building systems and materials; less deep and therefore less costly foundations due to the lower weight of steel buildings compared with traditional materials; and far longer uninterrupted spans between columns, resulting in much better flexibility of interior floor layout.  In addition, buildings designed using the Steligence® philosophy will be easier to assemble (and potentially disassemble) and therefore quicker to build, leading to significant efficiencies and cost savings for the construction sector.  While steel’s infinite recyclability potential is clearly superior to that of alternative materials, even then there are associated costs given the energy necessary to melt and re-form. In this context, design where possible using modular steel components can enable re-use rather than re-cycling of steel components in new buildings at the end of life of the original building. This ‘re-use’ possibility gives steel a huge advantage over traditional building materials, particularly as regulations strengthen regarding the sustainability credentials of buildings.  Steel already plays a big role in the circular economy. Steligence® will enable the construction industry and buildings themselves to play an even more significant role in it.  Speaking at a launch event in London, Greg Ludkovsky, ArcelorMittal’s global head of research and development, said: “As climate, energy and resource scarcity intensifies, win-win solutions like Steligence® become imperative for business and society at large. Buildings play a huge part in all our lives, so creating a construction concept that improves their social, economic and environmental impact while dramatically enhancing their functionality and aesthetics has been a huge but important challenge.”  “Steligence® is the culmination of several years’ intensive scientific, independent peer reviewed research to develop specific-use steel for the construction industry. By combining this R&D with extensive consultation of leading players in the construction industry, we have landed on a radical new approach to construction which is underpinned by a clear philosophy: to build a sustainable business around a sustainable construction industry that delivers for future generations.”  Notes to editors: Ten key benefits of the Steligence concept  Economic    * Optimal space and height. Use of the Angelina™ beam and CofraPlus 60 compact floor enables greatly reduced building height resulting in average 11% cost savings across façade, stairs and core elements.   * Lighter weight foundations. Steel foundation solutions, less than half the weight of equivalent structures, can result in an average 39% foundation cost saving, like-for-like.   * More flexible office space. Using the Angelina™ beam, un-interrupted spans of up to 13m can be achieved. Consequent reduction in columns allows easy reconfiguration of office space and therefore increased rental value.   * Speed of construction. Best in class steel solutions using 13m spans can be erected up to twice as fast as concrete equivalents in 8m and 5m spans resulting in up to 24% construction costs saving.   * Cost of ownership. Total costs of building ownership, taking into account all economic benefits, are at least 15% less than those constructed using alternative materials, when all components of the concept are applied.    Environmental    * Lower environmental impact. With comparatively low environmental impacts and higher recycling rates than other building materials, steel is the first choice for sustainable construction. Steel enableS access to the green building market with consequent increase in property value.   * Sustainability ratings. Buildings using ArcelorMittal steel solutions attain higher levels of certification in building rating schemes such as BREEAM and LEED than those built with traditional materials.    Social    * Improved comfort. Steel buildings provide a more comfortable environment for building users due to optimised thermal behaviour during warm weather.   * Site traffic. Steel requires fewer site deliveries than comparative materials, resulting in less traffic congestion and so reduced impact on the urban environment.   * Creativity. Steel cladding solutions offer an unparalleled choice of creative, attractive finishes, adding materially to the urban landscape.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2018-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal launches Steligence®, a radical and disruptive construction industry concept","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal has unveiled a radical new concept for the use of steel in construction, which will facilitate the next generation of high performance buildings and construction techniques and create a more sustainable life-cycle for buildings.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2018-jun-19-arcelormittal-launches-steligence\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Accordingly, if the Maximum Tender Cap is reached in respect of tenders made at or prior to the Early Tender Time, no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time will be accepted for purchase (irrespective of their priority level).  This announcement does not contain the full terms and conditions of the Offers, which are contained in the offer to purchase dated August 7, 2018 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Offer to Purchase”), and is subject to the offer restrictions set out below and more fully described in the Offer to Purchase.  Notes may be validly tendered at any time on or before 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on September 4, 2018, unless extended (as may be extended, the “Expiration Time”). Notes must be tendered in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Offer to Purchase. To receive the Total Consideration (as defined herein), plus any Accrued Interest, Holders must tender their Notes prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 20, 2018, unless extended (such time, as the same may be extended, the “Early Tender Time”). The “Total Consideration” is the U.S. dollar amount payable per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes set forth in the table above and includes an early tender premium of $50 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (the “Early Tender Premium”).

Subject to applicable law, the Company expressly reserves the right, but is not obligated to, increase the Maximum Tender Cap in its sole and absolute discretion without extending the Early Tender Time, the Withdrawal Deadline (as defined below) or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights.  Subject to the Maximum Tender Cap and the proration arrangements applicable to the Offers, all Notes of a Series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Time having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any tendered Notes of a Series having a lower Acceptance Priority Level.

{"id":6397,"text":"Two 81-tonne turbines, made in Japan, and shipped in containers 4.5m wide; 5m high and 8m long are being assembled before being mounted to modernised blast furnaces operating in Dąbrowa Górnicza, Poland. The turbines will increase the amount of energy the power plant generates, at no extra cost and without emissions.  Producing electricity using TRT technology is as sustainable as wind power, but much more efficient. The two new TRTs’ total capacity of 25 MW, is roughly equivalent to the output of eight to ten land-based wind turbines. To produce the same amount of energy from coal, it would be necessary to burn 52,000 tonnes of it annually, or 900 wagons worth. The associated emissions would amount to 90 tonnes of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and nine tonnes of dust.  TRT technology uses high-pressure gases (known as flue gases) which collect at the top of the blast furnace to drive very efficient electricity generators. The TRT turbine generates energy by exploiting a known property of all gases – that they expand as their pressure drops. Dry and wet scrubbing is used to remove fine particulates from the flue gas as it leaves the blast furnace. At this point, the pressure is between 2.0 and 2.2 bar. After the scrubbing process the gas pressure needs to be reduced to 0.15 bar in the septum valve for further combustion in gas boilers. The most energy efficient way to do this is to lead the gas through the turbine instead of the septum valve to drive a generator to produce electricity.   TRTs have no impact on blast furnace operations and the flue gas is not consumed. As blast furnace gas is very combustible, it is normally used in other parts of the plant to generate heat or energy for other processes. With the TRT system installed, the flue gas effectively generates energy twice – once in the turbine and again when it is burnt for its usual purpose.  “Until now, the TAMEH power plant produced energy out of blast furnace gas, but only after reducing its pressure. Now, where we used to reduce that pressure, we will install the TRTs, which will be powered by the compressed blast furnace gas to produce energy that would otherwise have been lost,” explains Artur Łój, project manager in the Investment Office, TAMEH Polska.  “After completing assembly of the TRTs, it will be necessary to install the generators, pipelines, and connect the turbines to the blast furnace gas installation. We have aligned our assembly dates to blast furnace operation schedules to take advantage of planned standstills to avoid disturbing work flows,” Artur Łój explains.  The investment, to be finalised this year, is worth over PLN 100 million. The project’s general contractor is a consortium comprised of Primetals and Eko Energia from Kraków. Many companies from the region are also involved in the project, with about 100 people working at the construction site each day.  Implementing TRT is part of ArcelorMittal’s ongoing commitment to research and developmental improvements to its processes to ensure technological superiority in the use of energy and raw materials. This reduces manufacturing costs, improves quality and minimises the company's environmental impact. TRT also provides ArcelorMittal with security over the sustainability of its long-term energy supply, and reduces its exposure to rising energy prices.  TAMEH HOLDING (TAURON ArcelorMittal Energy Holding) Is a joint venture between TAURON Group and ArcelorMittal Group, where each company holds 50% of the shares.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2018-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Turbines to produce clean energy at TAMEH power plant","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"For the first time in Poland, two top pressure recovery turbines (TRT) will be reusing high pressure flue gas from the top of the blast furnace to reduce ArcelorMittal’s carbon footprint – and its energy bill, while producing emission-free energy for TAMEH power plant in Dąbrowa Górnicza.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2018-aug-8-turbines-to-produce-clean-energy-at-tameh-power-plant\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["unsure"]}
{"id":6398,"text":"The investment will see the construction of a new continuous annealing line and a third galvanisation line for the production of cold rolled and galvanised products. The capacity of the unit is set to increase by 700,000 tonnes to a total of 2.1 million tonnes per year. The production is expected to begin in 2021.   The project will increase production for the automotive, construction and home appliances sectors at the Vega unit, allowing the company to meet the market expectations and provide high strength and quality steel products.  This investment is expected to sustain ArcelorMittal’s growth strategy in Brazil and Latin America.  “We expect the automotive industry to have a substantial increase in the utilisation rate. At the outset of the crisis, automakers were practically operating to serve the Brazilian and Argentinian markets only. The crisis forced automakers to develop alternative markets”, says Benjamin Baptista Filho, President of ArcelorMittal Brazil and CEO ArcelorMittal Flat Carbon South America.   Vega’s expansion project was on hold since 2011 due to the global crisis which started in 2009 and the Brazilian economic recession and reduction of the domestic market for vehicles. Today, 50% of the production at ArcelorMittal Vega is aimed at the automotive market. “We currently have a market to sell Vega’s products above the existing capacity.

{"id":6404,"text":"The VTC buzzed with excitement as apprentices and staff prepared to welcome the vice president of Liberia, distinguished government officials and ArcelorMittal Liberia’s senior management for the official launch of the centre. ArcelorMittal Liberia recognised an opportunity to empower youth, align education, workforce and economic development for a prosperous Liberia and started the journey to increase technical education by investing $7 million to re-open the technical education centre in Yekepa, Nimba county. The hard work and strategic planning of so many was realised at the launch.       Dawie Loots, manager and trainer at the VTC shared an overview of the program that clearly demonstrated his passion for his work and apprentices. “What an incredible journey!” he exclaimed. The heart of his speech spoke to the courage shown by ArcelorMittal Liberia to answer the call of the Liberian people as well as Liberians’ perseverance, hope and ability to unite for a greater good. Loots, his staff and the first class of VTC apprentices worked tirelessly to rehabilitate the buildings; “no contractors, no consultants. Just the VTC trainers & apprentices” he shared.       There are currently 47 apprentices at the vocational training centre studying various technical disciplines from diesel mechanic apprenticeships to electrician and mechanical fitting training. In 2021, powered by the official launch of the centre, the VTC hopes to train 100 apprentices. Entry into the vocational training centre is competitive as the program is free to successful candidates and houses and feeds them during the three-year duration of the apprenticeship.       Two apprentices spoke at the event Sam K. Dehmie (electrical apprentice) and Ernest Barlea (mechanical fitting apprentice). Both impressed vice president, Jewel Howard-Taylor as they described their experiences and their appreciation for the discipline, technical knowledge and awareness of safety in every aspect of their training. The young men are natives of Nimba County; Dehmie is a graduate of the ArcelorMittal Liberia school system. His friend Barlea urged his fellow apprentices to “take full advantage and do [their] best”.       The keynote address was delivered by Her Excellency, Jewel Howard Taylor, vice president of the Republic of Liberia. She brought greetings on behalf of President George Weah and thanked ArcelorMittal Liberia for its dedication to the nation. She commended the company for creating opportunities for youth stressing that “we must be involved in making meaningful contributions to their posterity through the acquisition of relevant skills which will enable them access to jobs and business opportunities. This is especially necessary, given the large numbers of unemployed and underemployed youths across our nation.” She asked local government to “please let us take politics out of development” encouraging cooperation between the government and the company; a message that was reiterated throughout the program by several government officials. “I believe that when the story is told of the renaissance of our beautiful nation, your story will be one of its successes. Our government looks forward to working with you through challenges which may arise and celebrating with you in the good times,” she said before touring the VTC.       “The Legislature is committed to work along with ArcelorMittal,” said Nimba County District 3 representative, Hon. Joseph N. Somwarbi. He shared that he was hopeful for the company’s presence in the county believing that more contractors would evolve into full time employees. He also emphasised that “recruitment [should be] transparent & training be adequate.”       According to Gustavo Gomes, vice president of mining operations for ArcelorMittal, Liberia is the fifth largest mine operation of ArcelorMittal mines worldwide. The business unit could become second largest in ArcelorMittal if an ongoing feasibility study leads to major investment in the next few years. “These young Liberians represent the future workforce of the company and overall technical experts in the nation,” he said.       As ArcelorMittal Liberia strives to expand its operations, jobs and knowledge are expected to increase, led by brilliant young Liberians, a government excited to engage investors and ArcelorMittal Liberia; a company that believes in Liberia’s immense potential.

This joint pledge by ArcelorMittal Mining Canada and ArcelorMittal Mining R&D marks the first major financial contribution by the fund to an educational institution in Canada.

Safety is ArcelorMittal’s top priority. To engage effectively with employees on a topic that literally can be a matter of life or death, corporate health and safety and communications departments collaborated to commission a video that would give everyone pause to think about why safety is a priority as well as why they want to return home safely at the end of each shift.  The film, follows the true and tragic story of their colleague ‘Max’, as read out by unsuspecting employee volunteers from around the world who represented all levels of seniority within the company. When it first aired internally across the company to mark ArcelorMittal’s annual Health and Safety Day in April, the film resonated so well with employees that they wanted to share it with their family and friends. So the company, for the first time ever, published its Health and Safety Day film externally. Since May 2018, We choose the safest way has had almost 25,000 YouTube views and is well on the way to becoming the company’s most-watched video production ever.  Robin Paulmier, Head of Corporate Health and Safety says, “The company has been organising an annual group-wide health and safety day for over a decade and although it has achieved a significant improvement in health and safety performance over that time, achieving our ultimate aim of being an injury-free workplace has proved elusive. To drive further progress toward this goal, the health and safety committee and I felt a fresh, personal and highly emotional message might encourage us all to stop and think about workplace safety in a way no other film has. We choose the safest way has achieved that goal beyond all expectation, touching not only our colleagues, but also a panel of esteemed film industry professionals. Congratulations and sincere thanks to everyone involved in this project, particularly our employee volunteers who connected with Max’s story with genuine emotion and gave the film its impact.”  Nicola Davidson, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Corporate Responsibility says, “We are all delighted with the award that recognises a film about a topic, health and safety, that is ArcelorMittal’s number one priority but that is creatively difficult to address. At the end of the day this film was made to help save lives and reduce accidents so it must tackle the issue head on, and make people stop and think about what more they can personally do to ensure we work in a truly safe environment at all times. Ensuring a safe working environment for all our employees every day takes constant attention and awareness and effective communication has a critical role to play. This is a film’s uniquely human approach resonated deeply with all parts of the company. Congratulations to everyone who was involved, including the volunteers, our own employees, who participated and made the film possible.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2018-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","title":"“We choose the safest way” is golden at Cannes","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal is delighted to announce that its ground-breaking health and safety film, We choose the safest way has won a gold medal at The Cannes Corporate Media & TV Awards in Cannes, France.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2018-oct-4-we-choose-the-safest-way-is-golden-at-cannes\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Collectively, these organisations employ 15 million people, 7 million of whom are women. This year’s GEI indexed companies account for US $9 trillion worth of traded stock market shares.  Bloomberg’s standardised gender reporting framework offers ArcelorMittal the opportunity to disclose information on how it promotes gender equality and to learn good practice from others on the index.  The GEI also provides the company with a framework for improving its understanding of how it promotes gender sensitivity in the way it does business, helping it to close the ‘gender gap’ in the broadest sense.  Bart Wille, executive vice president, head of human resources at ArcelorMittal said:  “ArcelorMittal has chosen to participate in the Gender-Equality Index because it gives us an opportunity to gain further insights to enhance an area we know we can strengthen further, that is achieving better female representation at all levels of the organisation. We want to publicly demonstrate our commitment to recruit, retain and develop the best talent – male or female – by building an inclusive culture and a strong and diverse talent pipeline. As a leading global industrial company, we operate in an extremely competitive landscape and we do not want to miss the opportunity to tap into half of the available global talent pool, or to cultivate the first-class ideas mixed gender teams can create.”  The GEI highlighted several elements of ArcelorMittal’s approach to gender equality as best in class results. These are:    * A third of the members of the company’s board of directors is female   * ArcelorMittal subsidiaries around the world promote Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) programmes which encourage young girls to pursue studies and a career in this area   * Female staff engage in the company’s Women in Leadership programme and   * The company is an active member of gender equality organisations, e.g. Women in Mining.    The GEI is also an important resource for investors who wish to benchmark ArcelorMittal’s performance on gender diversity against that of its peers. Such data increasingly influences investment decisions, so transparency on this and other key environmental, social and governance performance metrics is the cornerstone for good investor relations.   “We applaud ArcelorMittal and the 229 firms tracked by the index for their action to measure gender equality through the Bloomberg GEI framework,” said Peter T. Grauer, Chairman of Bloomberg and Founding Chairman of the U.S. 30% club. ArcelorMittal’s GEI inclusion is a strong indicator to investors and industry peers alike that it is leading by example to advance ongoing efforts for a truly inclusive workforce.”  The Bloomberg gender reporting framework is voluntary reference index and has no associated costs. All public companies can submit data to Bloomberg. Those with a security listed on a U.S. exchange and a market capitalisation of US 1 billion or greater are eligible for index inclusion.

{"id":6423,"text":"Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, ArcelorMittal Chairman and CEO, said:  “2018 was a year of positive momentum for ArcelorMittal characterized by important strategic and financial progress. Operating in a healthy market environment, the Company enjoyed a strong financial performance, delivering substantial profitability improvement. Having considerably strengthened our balance sheet in recent years, we also regained our investment grade credit rating.  With an established leadership position in many regions, ArcelorMittal targets specific growth opportunities to complement our existing global presence. The acquisitions of Votorantim and Ilva, both completed in 2018, provide us with enhanced leadership positions in key markets. Meanwhile our bid for Essar can provide us with a quality, scalable presence in the rapidly expanding India steel market.  Delivery against our Action 2020 targets is an important focus for the Group in 2019. We did not perform at an optimum level operationally in 2018 and will seek to minimize operational disruption this year to ensure we meet our volume targets.  Although the issue of global overcapacity persists and there are well publicised macro-economic risks, we expect further, moderate global steel demand growth this year. Having considerably strengthened the Company in recent years, we are in a strong position to generate healthy levels of free cash and prosper through the cycle.”  Fourth quarter 2018 earnings analyst conference call  ArcelorMittal management (including CEO and CFO) will host a conference call for members of the investment community to discuss the fourth quarter period ended December 31, 2018 on: Thursday February 7, 2019 at 9.30am US Eastern time; 2.30pm London time and 3.30pm CET.  ### The dial in numbers are:  Location | Toll free dial in numbers | Local dial in numbers |  Participant   ---|---|---|---   UK local: | 0800 0515 931 | +44(0)2033645807 | 12722991#   US local: | 1 86 6719 2729 | +12406450345 | 12722991#   US (New York): | 1 86 6719 2729 | +16466637901 | 12722991#   France: | 0800 914780 | +33170712916 | 12722991#   Germany: | 0800 965 6288 | +4969271340801 | 12722991#   Spain: | 90 099 4930 | +34911143436 | 12722991#   Luxembourg: | 800 26908 | +35227860507 | 12722991#      A replay of the conference call will be available for one week by dialing: +49 (0) 1805 2047 088; Access code 2523083#","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal reports fourth quarter 2018 and full year 2018 results","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (referred to as “ArcelorMittal” or the “Company”) (MT (New York, Amsterdam, Paris, Luxembourg), MTS (Madrid)), the world’s leading integrated steel and mining company, today announced results[1] for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-reports-fourth-quarter-2018-and-full-year-2018\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6424,"text":"Having informed and discussed the situation with the local authorities, it was agreed that the 200 person community situated downstream to the dam should be evacuated as a precautionary measure.  The action follows an updated site-based assessment commissioned by ArcelorMittal Mining of the tailings dam by the Independent Tailings Review Panel following the recent incidents in the Brazilian mining sector. The assessment included stress tests on the Serra Azul pond applying early observations available from the Feijao dam. Based on the range of factor of safety evaluation, a decision was taken to evacuate all residents while further testing is undertaken and any mitigation measures can be implemented. The historic failure-flow-path when the dam was active was approximately four to five kilometres.  This is a purely precautionary measure and the community is situated 5km from the dam. The company concluded that absolutely no risk can be taken and, despite the obvious disruption to the community, this is the right decision.  The community have been moved into temporary accommodation. They will remain there while further tests are ongoing and until the security of the tailings pond can be 100% guaranteed.  Benjamin Baptista, ArcelorMittal Brazil CEO said, “We apologise to the local community for the disruption; however we know this is the right and indeed only decision that we could take and the authorities agreed. We will endeavour to get people back in their homes as soon as possible although at this point it is not possible to say when that will be. Experts continue to analyse the tailings pond and in the event that measures have to be implemented to further secure the pond that will be carried out as swiftly as possible. We thank the employees and community for their understanding during this difficult time.”  Sebastiao Costa Filho, CEO Mining Brazil said: “Our absolute priority is to ensure our people and our communities are safe. We will be maintaining close communication with those affected to keep them updated about the situation. As soon as we have further information we will make further announcements. I would also like to thank everyone affected – this is clearly a difficult situation and one we hope will be resolved as swiftly as possible.”  The Serra Azul mine is located in Itatiaiuçu, Minas Gerais State, in Brazil. It produces 1.2 million tonnes of concentrate and lump ore. The tailings dam, which is an upstream dam, has been idled since October 2012. It is the only such “upstream” dam in the company’s mining portfolio.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal evacuates community situated around its dormant Serra Azul tailing dam as precautionary measure","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announces that after very careful consideration it has taken the decision to put in practice the evacuation plan related to its dormant Serra Azul tailing dam, in Brazil.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-feb-8-arcelormittal-evacuates-community\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6430,"text":"We employ a strong governance model based on the MAC (Mining Association of Canada) guidelines for TSFs. Our global tailings stewardship programme employs three types of audit – in-house at site level, in-house at corporate level, and a third, entirely independent audit – and these are aimed at providing a ‘triple check’ of our TSFs against our corporate standard and international guidelines (including ANCOLD, MAC and CDA).  Following the Feijão accident, our particular focus was on Serra Azul, where our TSF is the only one in our portfolio that uses an upstream ‘wet’ dam construction. The TSF had been dormant since 2012 and possesses significantly lower moisture content than that reported for the Feijão TSF. Applying early concerns from the Feijão TSF failure, we stress-tested the Serra Azul dam model safety factors. Consequently, we decided to err on the side of caution and evacuate the local community downstream of the dam, enabling us to carry out further testing and safely implement any mitigation measures.  This is a disruption to the community, for which we are sorry, but we are convinced that it has been the right thing to do and we are working hard to ensure we look after the needs of those affected. After moving households located within approximately 5km from the dam into hotels, we set up an emergency response plan to look after their livestock and business assets, and to ensure the children have continued access to education. By March 2019, a phased plan to rehouse the families has begun, following international best practice.  We are currently reviewing our approach to decommissioning the Serra Azul TSF to maximise safety.  Our tailings transition plan   Across all our TSFs, we have developed an approach to optimise their safety.    1. No new wet tailings dams.   2. Accelerate the use of non-wet disposal such as thickened paste tailings or dry stack tailings options where possible. We already employ this approach in Mexico and Brazil iron ore mines.   3. Optimise the use of radar and satellite monitoring to heighten the sensitivity of remote monitoring and enable transparent access to this data.    These three principles are underpinned by our strong TSF governance system.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Ensuring the safety of our tailings storage facilities","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"The tragedy of the Vale Feijão dam failure prompted all mining companies to examine the monitoring systems at their tailings storage facilities (TSFs).

{"id":6433,"text":"This year, the Group intends to launch a new project in the ArcelorMittal plant in Hamburg to use hydrogen on an industrial scale for the direct reduction of iron ore in the steel production process for the first time. A pilot plant is to be built in the coming years.  Already today, the Hamburg plant has one of the most efficient production processes of the ArcelorMittal Group due to the use of natural gas in a direct reduction plant (DRI). The aim of the new hydrogen-based process is to be able to produce steel with the lowest CO2 emissions. The project costs amount to around 65 million euros. In addition, a cooperation agreement with the University of Freiberg is planned to test the procedure in the coming years at the Hamburg plant premises.   \"Our Hamburg site offers optimum conditions for this innovative project: an electric arc furnace with DRI system and iron ore pellets stockyard as well as decades of know-how in this area. The use of hydrogen as a reducing agent shall now be tested in a new shaft furnace,\" comments Frank Schulz, CEO of ArcelorMittal Germany.  The hydrogen-based reduction of iron ore will initially take place on a demonstration scale with an annual production of 100,000 tonnes.  In the process, the separation of H2 with a purity of more than 95 percent from the top gas of the existing plant should be achieved by so-called pressure swing adsorption. The process is first tested with grey hydrogen (generated at gas separation) to allow for economical operation. In the future, the plant should also be able to run on green hydrogen (generated from renewable sources) when it is available in sufficient quantities.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"World first for steel: ArcelorMittal investigates the industrial use of pure hydrogen","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Cologne, March 28, 2019 - To permanently reduce CO2 emissions, ArcelorMittal has developed a low-emissions technology strategy, which targets not only the use of alternative feedstocks and the conversion of CO2 emissions, but also the direct avoidance of carbon (Carbon Direct Avoidance, or CDA).","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-mar-28-world-first-for-steel\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6439,"text":"The review underpins the Company’s commitment to transparent reporting. It has been produced in-line with the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework and demonstrates the Company’s approach to ensuring it brings long-term, sustainable value to its broad stakeholder base. It outlines the Company’s progress against its four strategic priorities, namely: improving its safety performance; achieving its financial targets; delivering on its Action 2020 strategic plan; and integrating sustainability into the business.  The review, which can be accessed online at http:\/\/annualreview2018.arcelormittal.com includes videos of several members of ArcelorMittal’s senior management team, including: Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO; Aditya Mittal, President and CFO, ArcelorMittal and CEO, ArcelorMittal Europe; Brian Aranha, executive vice president; and David Clarke, vice president. Topics covered include:    * ArcelorMittal’s health and safety performance in 2018: progress made against its stated ambition of zero injuries and fatalities and the approach being undertaken to drive further improvement and instill a safety-first culture throughout the organisation;   * ArcelorMittal’s financial and operational performance in 2018: progress made in the third year of the Company’s five-year strategic plan, Action 2020; how the Company further strengthened its balance sheet; and how it is strengthening its operating platform through selectively investing in high-return opportunities;   * The steps the Company is taking to integrate sustainable development into its business, with a focus on: improving safety performance; addressing the carbon challenge; building a high-performing organisation; innovating to support customers and society; providing customer reassurance through global standards and certification; and anticipating and responding to social and environmental trends.    Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal said:  “As the world’s leading steel and mining company, our world-class steel solutions have an important role to play in society. Our goal is to ensure that steel remains the world’s material of choice, and ArcelorMittal the world’s preferred steel supplier. We aim to do this in a manner that is as efficient and effective as possible so we can return value to our broad stakeholder base.  “Against a backdrop of positive market conditions, ArcelorMittal delivered its best financial performance for several years, generating Ebitda of $10.3 billion and net income of $5.1 billion. We also now have industry-leading balance sheet strength and are investing in opportunities to create value so that we build an even stronger, more resilient group. Two good examples of this last year were our acquisitions of Ilva in Italy and Votorantim in Brazil. We also progressed our five-year strategic plan, Action 2020, and have now delivered $1.6 billion from our $3 billion Ebitda target. We therefore have a lot to be pleased about with our performance in 2018.  “Our focus, however, is to ensure that ArcelorMittal is not just successful today, but that our success endures into the future. To do this we must ensure that sustainable development is embedded throughout our business. Addressing climate change and supporting the transition to a low-carbon, circular economy is an important part of this. We are developing a low-emissions technology strategy but need to see public policy evolve to support our efforts.  “Elsewhere, the launch of Steligence® last year is a good example of how we are innovating to meet customers environmental and sustainability goals. It provides our construction sector customers with sustainable building solutions now, while promoting the reuse of steel components at the end of a building’s life. And last year, we also continued to advance our efforts to develop an industry-wide supply-chain assurance scheme, ResponsibleSteel™, which will provide customers with the reassurance they need.  “To conclude, 2018 was a positive year for ArcelorMittal. Our strategic priorities are well established and our focus for the year ahead and beyond is clear. ArcelorMittal is a more resilient, more focused, more capable business than it ever has been.”  Key highlights of ArcelorMittal’s sustainable development approach and progress discussed in the review include:    * Further progress in safety performance, with a record low lost-time injury frequency rate of 0.69x;   * The steps the Company is taking to address the carbon challenge, how it is developing a broad range of technologies to enable it to transition to low-emissions steelmaking and support the objectives of the 2015 Paris agreement. The Company is developing a corporate action plan for carbon reduction which will support a new group-wide 2030 target, to be announced next year. It also plans to publish a detailed Climate Action report in the coming weeks.   * Case studies on:   * A mapping of the UN sustainable development goals against those the Company addresses through its approach to integrating sustainable development into the business;   * A summary of value creation for stakeholders in 2018, in the Company’s value creation model. Examples include   * $4.8 billion total tax contribution;   * $652 million allocated to environmental and energy capital projects;   * A 7% reduction in dust emissions per tonne of steel over three years and a corresponding reduction in NOx of 6%;   * 70 new patents filed and 26 new products launched aimed at creating sustainable development value with a further 38 R&D projects for sustainable development in the pipeline;   * 10 million tonnes of CO2 avoided due to the re-use of blast furnace slag in the cement industry;   * Inclusion in the Bloomberg gender diversity index.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes 2018 integrated annual review","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’), the world’s leading steel and mining company, has today published its 2018 integrated annual review.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-apr-29-arcelormittal-publishes-2018-integrated-annual-review\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["unsure"]}
{"id":6440,"text":"ArcelorMittal today announces its intention to temporarily idle production at its steelmaking facilities in Kraków, Poland and reduce production in Asturias, Spain. In addition, the planned increase of shipments at ArcelorMittal Italia to a six million tonne annual run-rate will be slowed down following a decision to optimise cost and quality over volume in this environment.   Together, these actions will result in a temporary annualised production reduction of around three million tonnes.  Commenting, Geert van Poelvoorde, CEO, ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, said:  “The difficult decision to temporarily reduce our European primary flat steel production has not been taken lightly. We understand the impact this has on employees and the local communities and will be working to ensure social measures are in place to support them during this period.  “These actions reflect the weak demand environment in Europe today, a situation further compounded by increased imports despite the safeguard measures introduced by the European Commission. High energy costs and increasing carbon costs are adding to the tough environment.  “We are engaging with stakeholders to request that the safeguards are strengthened to prevent a further increase in imports as a result of continued global overcapacity and a weakening economy in neighbouring countries including Turkey. We will also continue to make our case for a green border adjustment to be introduced to ensure that imports into Europe face the same carbon costs as producers in Europe. The steel industry in Europe can have a strong future but there must be a level playing field to ensure that an unfair advantage is not given to competitors outside the region.”  In Kraków, the primary production (blast furnace and steel plant) will be temporarily idled. The Polish steel market has been particularly hard hit, due to a near fourfold year-on-year increase in Russian steel imports in 2018, and among the highest electricity prices in Europe.  In Asturias, primary production will be reduced. Electricity costs are also very high in Spain, and the southern European market has been hit by an unprecedented rise in imports from outside the EU.  Despite the introduction of the permanent EU safeguard tariffs in February 2019 there has been a continued and consistent rise in flat steel imports into Europe. Flat steel imports into Europe are currently at record highs, with imports of hot rolled coil up 37 per cent this year from 2017, on an annualised basis. In addition, the price of carbon has risen by approximately 230 per cent since the start of 2018, placing further competitive pressure on European steelmakers. In the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), only steel produced in Europe is subject to a carbon levy. ArcelorMittal has previously called for the introduction of a green border adjustment whereby steel imported into Europe has the same standards applied on CO2 as European produced steel under the ETS.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal to temporarily reduce annualised European primary steelmaking production by three million tonnes","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Regrettable decision necessary due to combination of weakening demand, rising imports coupled with insufficient EU trade protection, high energy costs and rising carbon costs","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-to-temporarily-reduce-annualised-european\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6444,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) has today published its first Climate Action report in which it announces its ambition to significantly reduce CO2 emissions globally and be carbon neutral in Europe by 2050. To achieve this goal the Company is building a strategic roadmap linked to the evolution of public policy and developments in low-emissions steelmaking technologies. A target to 2030 will be launched in 2020, replacing the Company’s current target of an 8% carbon footprint reduction by 2020, against a 2007 baseline.  The report explains in greater detail the future challenges and opportunities for the steel industry, the plausible technology pathways the Company is exploring as well as its views on the policy environment required for the steel industry to succeed in meeting the targets of the Paris Agreement.  Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “We believe it can be possible for the steel industry to deliver carbon emissions reductions targets in line with the Paris agreement. We are committed to this objective and are actively piloting several low-carbon steelmaking technologies. Central to achieving this aspiration will be supportive policy to ensure a global level playing field, access to sufficient clean energy at competitive prices and access to finance. The energy industry has made great strides in creating a pathway to lower emissions through supportive policy and we are confident the same can be true for steel.  “Limiting the temperature increase to two degrees or less is no easy challenge. Real and genuine understanding of the complexities and an approach of collaboration and flexibility will be critical if we are to succeed. Specifically, we will need a more supportive policy environment that considers the global nature of steel, the cost implications of significantly changing the way steel is made and the clean energy supply needed to do so. If we can work together to solve the problem, I’m convinced the steel industry will be able to make a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions globally.”   As one of the world’s most prolific materials, with 1.7 billion tonnes of steel produced in 2018, the steel industry today accounts for approximately 7% per cent of global emissions. And with demand for steel and materials set to further increase - forecasts show demand rising to 2.6 billion tonnes in 2050 - it is vital the industry finds ways to significantly reduce its carbon emissions to successfully meet the ambitions of the Paris agreement and help limit the global average temperature rise to less than two degrees.  At present carbon is used as a reductant in the blast furnace to separate oxygen from iron-ore as a critical part of the steel-making process. Significantly reducing the emissions footprint of steel will, in all likelihood, require a fundamental change in the science of steelmaking  As the world’s leading steel company, ArcelorMittal recognises it has a leading role to play in developing breakthrough technologies that will support and enable a global transition to a low-carbon economy. The Company has identified three distinct pathways that have the potential to deliver a significant reduction in carbon emissions. These are:    * Clean power steelmaking, using clean power as the energy source for hydrogen-based steelmaking, and longer-term for direct electrolysis steelmaking   * Circular carbon steelmaking, which uses circular carbon energy sources, such as waste biomass, to displace fossil fuels in steelmaking, thereby enabled low-emissions steelmaking   * Fossil fuel carbon capture and storage, where the current method of steel production is maintained but the carbon is then captured and stored or re-used rather than emitted into the atmosphere.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes first Climate Action Report","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Report states ArcelorMittal’s ambition to significantly reduce global CO2 emissions and be carbon neutral in its European operations by 2050","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-publishes-first-climate-action-report\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6445,"text":"If ratified as currently drafted, the provision concerning the Taranto plant would impair any operator’s ability to operate the plant while implementing the environmental plan approved by the Italian Government in September 2017, including for ArcelorMittal. The Taranto plant has been under seizure since 2012 and cannot be operated without legal protection until the environmental plan is implemented.  The 2017 environmental plan is designed to address the Taranto plant’s long-standing issues and transform it into a state-of-the-art European steel facility by applying best available techniques, with an overall environmental investment by AMI of over €1.15 billion. The implementation of the agreed plan is proceeding according to schedule.  However, the Crescita law decree removes the legal safeguards existing when ArcelorMittal agreed to invest in the Taranto plant. These safeguards are necessary until the company has completed the environmental plan to avoid incurring liability for issues that it did not create.  The law decree is to be ratified into law by 29th June. AMI remains hopeful that, as part of the amendment process, legal certainty will be restored in the interest of the Italian economy and of the stakeholders of ArcelorMittal Italia, enabling AMI to continue operate of the plant while completing the environmental requalification plan.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Statement regarding the Italian Crescita law decree and its potential implications for ArcelorMittal Italia","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal confirms that its Italian subsidiary (ArcelorMittal Italia “AMI”) has highlighted to the Italian government its concerns about the current text of the Crescita law decree.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/statement-regarding-the-italian-crescita-law-decree\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6447,"text":"ResponsibleSteel™ is the steel industry’s first, multi-stakeholder certification initiative that aims to set a single, global standard for the entire ‘mine-to-metal’ steel value chain. The multi-stakeholder initiative, of which ArcelorMittal was a founding member and has played a leading role in developing, was first established in 2015. Efforts to accelerate the creation of the standard, including extensive public consultation periods, have increased over the past 12 months, leading to yesterday’s approval of draft version four. The standard will enable steel producers to prove their production processes and products meet rigorously defined standards across a broad range of social, environmental and ethical criteria. It will also serve to improve responsible sourcing of raw materials used in steelmaking and reduce supply-chain risk.  Commenting at the event, Alan Knight, head of sustainable development at ArcelorMittal and co-chair of ResponsibleSteel™ said:  “I am encouraged both by the progress we have made in developing the ResponsibleSteel™ standard and the broad-based interest in the scheme. For a scheme like this to truly gain market acceptance we need involvement, collaboration and input from multiple stakeholder groups. Steel industry participants clearly have an important role to play in its development, but an accreditation scheme created solely by the steel industry and for the steel industry would lack credibility. The multi-stakeholder aspect is critical, so the support and membership sign up we have received from mining majors, financial institutions, steel consuming customers and NGOs brings that credibility. It has also been integral in ensuring the development of the standard is sufficiently stringent – we received over 600 responses to the public consultation carried out on version three of the standard. With this input carried into version four, I am confident the scheme will be market ready later this year and will achieve its objective of providing the reassurance steel customers and industry stakeholders need on industry sustainability standards.”  ResponsibleSteel™ currently has 19 full members and 18 associate members including steel producers (Aperam, ArcelorMittal, BlueScope Steel, VAMA and voestalpine), financial institutions (HSBC), automotive majors (BMW and Daimler), NGOs (International Union for Conservation of Nature, Fauna and Flora International, CDP and others) and associated industry bodies (IndustriALL, International Tin Association and International Zinc Association).  ArcelorMittal has undertaken readiness assessment against version three of the standard across nearly all its European flat products production sites, and at sites in the US and Brazil, with positive results. It is currently working on a site assessment and verification plan, starting in Europe, in anticipation of the market launch of the standard later this year.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Inaugural steel industry certification standard, ResponsibleSteel™, on track for market launch before year-end","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Following a two-day members’ meeting last week, hosted by ArcelorMittal at the ArcelorMittal Orbit at the Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, version four of the new draft ResponsibleSteel™ certification standard has been reviewed by members with formal market launch of the standard now expected towards the end of the year.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/phase-two-2019-june-24-inaugural-steel-industry-certification-standard\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements of Directive 2014\/65\/EU on financial instruments, as amended (“MiFID II”) and local implementing measures and each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate (the “Target Market Assessment”). Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ Target Market Assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.  Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Notes may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Notes offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Notes is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the offering.

{"id":6455,"text":"In a report released today, ArcelorMittal ranks first in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) report ‘Melting Point’, in the categories of low carbon innovations, transition opportunities, data transparency, renewable energy use and board and executive climate management.  The world’s leading steel and mining company ranked second place overall in the latest report from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which ranked 20 of the largest and highest-impact publicly listed steel companies worldwide. ArcelorMittal ranked fifth in CDP’s 2016 report.  The new report is based on detailed analysis across a range of carbon and transitional indicators which could have a significant impact on company performance. The league table is designed to serve as a proxy for business readiness in an industry which will face increasing challenges as governments increase efforts to implement the Paris Agreement.  Key highlights include:    * Transition opportunities – ArcelorMittal is ranked first for investing in a suite of radical and transformative technologies including Carbon2value, SIDERWIN, IGAR and Torero with significant decarbonisation potential.   * Data transparency – ArcelorMittal is ranked first for having the most comprehensive emissions and energy disclosures of its peer group, reporting emissions according to Worldsteel’s guidelines   * Low carbon innovations – ArcelorMittal is ranked first for pioneering a number of breakthrough technologies such as the SIDERWIN project to produce iron ore via electrolysis. The report also highlights our $65 million investment on an industrial scale DRI hydrogen-based plant in Hamburg.   * Renewable energy use – ArcelorMittal is ranked first with a number of renewable assets including 75MWe solar capacity, for multiple PPAs to acquire solar and wind power and for actively exploring the potential for further PPAs to supply its steel plants.   * Board and executive climate management – ArcelorMittal ranked first and recognised for having a sustainability committee at a board level overseeing the company’s sustainability issues and low-carbon transition strategies.   * Climate governance and strategy – ArcelorMittal is ranked second and is recognised for our ambition to be carbon neutral in its Europe operations by 2050 and for officially supporting the TCFD and other climate initiatives in the industry.    Alan Knight, Corporate Responsibility General Manager, at ArcelorMittal, says: “While steel has a lower carbon intensity that many other materials, the large volumes produced globally mean that the industry emits more than three gigatons of CO2 annually. With the demand for steel ever increasing, we know we have a role to play and a clear responsibility to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of steel.”  Knight says: “We’re very pleased that the CDP League Tables have recognised our efforts, with our ranking going up from fifth to second place. We are trialling new technologies in our steel plants, making significant investments in R&D and working with our customers to provide the most sustainable products.”  Knight continues “We know that there is more work to be done to achieve our ambition of being carbon neutral in Europe by 2050, and to significantly reduce our carbon emissions worldwide. Working with stakeholders to create supportive policies to ensure a global level playing field, access to renewable energy at affordable process and access to finance will be critical in achieving greater impact.”  ArcelorMittal recently published its first Climate Action report in which it announced its ambition to significantly reduce CO2emissions globally and be carbon neutral in Europe by 2050. To achieve this goal the company is building a strategic roadmap linked to the evolution of public policy and developments in low-emissions steelmaking technologies.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal ranked best steel company for low carbon innovations","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal has been ranked first in the world in five categories relating to steel companies’ readiness for a low carbon transition.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-jul-31-arcelormittal-ranked-best-steel-company-for-low-carbon-innovations\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6456,"text":"Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, ArcelorMittal Chairman and CEO, said:  \"After a strong 2018, market conditions in the first half of 2019 have been very tough, with the profitability of our steel segments suffering due to lower steel prices combined with higher raw material costs. This has been only partially offset by improved profitability from our mining segment, but I am pleased that we have generated healthy free cash flow demonstrating the improved robustness of the business thanks to our Action 2020 plan.  Global overcapacity remains a clear challenge. We have reduced capacity in Europe in response to the current weak demand environment, which has also impacted the turnaround of the ex-Ilva facilities in Italy. Further action needs to be taken to address the increasing level of imports entering the continent due to ineffective safeguard measures and we continue to engage with the European Commission to create a level playing field for the sector. A supportive regulatory and funding environment is also crucial to our ambition to significantly reduce our emissions as announced in our recent Climate Action report.  We are taking further actions to adapt and strengthen the Company, ensuring we make continued progress towards our net debt target and increase returns to shareholders. Despite the current challenges, the Company is well positioned to benefit from any improvement in market conditions and the current very low spread environment\".

{"id":6461,"text":"In total, the gender equality index now covers approximately 14,800 employees, representing 94% of its workforce in France. Of these 14,800 employees in France, 82% are above the 75 point threshold out of 100 with more than half (53%) in the higher category, scoring 88 points out of 100 or more.  The scores are as follows (out of 100 points, with a minimum of 75 points to be achieved):    * ArcelorMittal Distribution Solutions France (737 employees): 88 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Maizières Research (589 employees): 88 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Construction France (951 employees): 84 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Wire France (510 employees): 84 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal France Saint-Denis (308 employees): 83 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Gandrange (292 employees): 79 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Service Centres (693 employees): 61 out of 100    These 7 companies represent a total of 4,080 employees.  ArcelorMittal Service Centres is the only one to score slightly below the 75 point threshold. Despite a good performance on equal pay (36 points out of 40), the overall score is lower due a gap in individual increases. Corrective actions have already been implemented to help the company improve in this area.  In March 2019, ArcelorMittal published the gender equality index for its three largest companies in France, which together represent nearly 11,000 employees:    * ArcelorMittal France, formerly ArcelorMittal Atlantique et Lorraine* (6,900 employees): 89 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Méditerranée (2,600 employees): 83 out of 100   * ArcelorMittal Industeel (1,100 employees): 73 out of 100**    ArcelorMittal's proactive policies in the field of professional equality have made it possible in particular to achieve a good overall level of equal pay, equal individual increases and individual increase rates upon return from maternity leave.  Eric Niedziela, Vice President of ArcelorMittal and CEO of ArcelorMittal France, says: “Being a woman in the steel industry should no longer be an exception. Whether they are maintenance technicians or quality managers, R&D researchers or production apprentices, women now occupy a variety of jobs at ArcelorMittal. We strongly support this equality of opportunity approach.”  ArcelorMittal aims to support equal opportunities and further expand its talent pool by recruiting and promoting women within its structures. A variety of initiatives are in place nationally and locally at the sites to promote the steel industry and change its image in order to encourage women to join the company: interventions in middle and high schools, site visits, relations with the grandes écoles, partnership with the \"Elles Bougent\" association, \"Femmes de steel\" operation on the Fos-sur-Mer site.  In terms of remuneration, during negotiations with the social partners, an analysis is systematically carried out on wages by gender and work regime, particularly full-time and part-time.

{"id":6463,"text":"Equinor is a partner in the Northern Lights project, together with partners Shell and Total, which includes transport, reception and permanent storage of CO2 in a reservoir in the northern part of the North Sea.  ArcelorMittal committed to the project with Equinor at a ceremony in Oslo, where the European Commission is hosting a High-Level Conference on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) together with the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. Today, memorandums of understanding have been signed between Equinor and ArcelorMittal, as well as Air Liquide, Ervia, Fortum Oyj, HeidelbergCement AG, Preem, and Stockholm Exergi.  As part of the project, ArcelorMittal – which has an ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050 within Europe - has committed to a number of joint activities including the development of logistics, exploring potential commercial models, and advocating on the topic of carbon capture and use (CCU) and CCS, as an important part of the successful decarbonisation of European industry. The company’s primary role will be the capture of CO2 gas from its blast furnaces.  At the end of 2019, the partnership plans to drill a wildcat well for CO2 storage in the Johanson formation covered by the Aurora licence (EL001) to study the reservoir’s suitability and capacity for CO2 storage.

{"id":6464,"text":"Both companies have now signed a Framework Collaboration Agreement (FCA) to cooperate on several projects, ranging from research and development to the implementation of new technologies. The FCA will be governed by a number of Project Development Agreements, incorporating the expertise of Midrex and ArcelorMittal. The first Project Development Agreement is to demonstrate in Hamburg the large-scale production and use of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) made with 100% hydrogen as the reductant.   In the coming years, the demonstration plant will produce about 100,000 tons of direct reduced iron per year - initially with grey hydrogen sourced from natural gas. Conversion to green hydrogen from renewable energy sources will take place once available in sufficient quantities and at an economical cost. Energy for hydrogen production could come from wind farms off the coast of Northern Germany. The plant will be the world’s first direct reduction plant on an industrial scale, powered by hydrogen.  \"We are working with a world class provider, Midrex Technologies, to learn how you can produce virgin iron for steelmaking at a large scale by only using hydrogen. This project combined with our ongoing projects on the use of non-fossil carbon and on carbon capture and use is key to become carbon neutral in Europe in 2050. Large scale demonstrations are critical to show our ambition. However it will depend on the political conditions, how fast transformation will take place\", comments Carl de Maré, Vice President at ArcelorMittal and responsible for technology strategy.       ArcelorMittal Hamburg already produces steel using DRI technology. During the process, iron oxide pellets are reduced to metallic iron, the raw material for high quality steel, by extracting oxygen using natural gas. \"Our site is the most energy-efficient production plant at ArcelorMittal\", says Dr Uwe Braun, CEO at ArcelorMittal Hamburg, adding that the existing Midrex plant in Hamburg is also the plant with the lowest CO2-emissions for high quality steel production in Europe. \"With the new, hydrogen-based DRI plant we are now planning, we will raise steel production to a completely new level, as part of our Europe-wide ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050\", Dr Braun concludes.  \"This commercial scale project will show the path for hydrogen based iron and steel making\", commented Stephen C.

{"id":6465,"text":"Installed by Eneco, this is their largest project to date. The project will help ArcelorMittal Belgium in becoming more sustainable as the power generated will be used internally by ArcelorMittal in Ghent. More than 5,000 employees are also given the opportunity to co-invest in the solar panels and benefit from the revenues.  Eneco -the largest solar energy producer in Belgium- has installed a 7.5 million euros solar roof at ArcelorMittal in Ghent. The park consists of 27,104 solar panels for which 157.2 tons of steel was used. The total weight of the installation amounts to 1.5 million kilos. This means that ArcelorMittal now owns the fourth largest solar park in Belgium and the largest solar roof in Belgium.  Reinforce sustainability strategy  The new solar panels will produce 10.000MWh annually, equal to the energy consumption of 2,900 households. The solar panels, together with the site’s (current) 10 wind turbines and the 2 additionally planned wind turbines, will soon provide approximately 50MW of renewable power to the Ghent site. The sustainable energy that is generated is used entirely internally to feed the production of ArcelorMittal in Ghent.  Today, ArcelorMittal Belgium is a world-leader in energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. With this investment, the company reinforces the implementation of its sustainability strategy. ArcelorMittal Belgium follows the climate agreement of Paris. The site’s emissions are already 25% lower than in 1990, which is 20% better than what the Paris climate agreement demands. By 2027, ArcelorMittal Belgium aims to produce 43% fewer emissions, with the ambition of being carbon neutral by 2050.*  “The renewable energy generated by these 27,104 solar panels supports us in achieving our ambition to be climate-neutral by 2050. We’re fully committed to this ambition and excited to launch Belgium’s largest solar roof. Alongside our soon to be installed additional wind- turbines, we’re again taking steps in the right direction. In addition, the new solar panels are also a good example of the importance of steel in our daily lives. The panels are fixed on a framework made of steel coated with Magnelis®. The Magnelis® steel, produced at our production site in Liège among others, is a strong illustration of sustainability. It guarantees the long-term viability of each solar park, regardless of the environment in which it is located. Steel clearly is a sustainable product for a more sustainable future.” Manfred Van Vlierberghe, CEO ArcelorMittal Belgium.  More than 5,000 employees have the chance to co-invest in solar panels  The 5,800 employees of ArcelorMittal Belgium who work at the sites in Ghent, Genk, Geel and Liège have the opportunity to invest in the solar panels and to benefit from the revenues. They are offered this opportunity by means of crowdlending, a loan whereby the collaborators lend money to Eneco for a period of six years. They receive a guaranteed gross return of 4 percent for their investment. Each employee can invest between 250 euros and 1000 euros to ArcelorMittal Belgium for the solar roof.  “If you, for example, lend 500 euros, you will earn an extra 20 euros a year. In six years’ time, the employee earns 120 euros. After the term, (s)he will recover the original investment of 500 euros as well. Through crowdlending, we want to actively involve the employees in this sustainable project. By doing so, we hope to raise their awareness about the importance of sustainable energy and reward them for their efforts. We are therefore delighted that a major industrial player such as ArcelorMittal Belgium is reflecting on its energy consumption and is actively contributing to making a greener future possible for future generations”. Iwein Goigne, CEO Eneco Solar Belgium.  For Eneco, this is the second project, after Volvo Car Gent, in which employees can participate by means of crowdlending.  Fast growing energy vision within Ghent industry  The initiative of ArcelorMittal Belgium and Eneco is in line with the Flemish Government’s Energy Vision for 2021 – 2030. This Energy Vision states that energy consumption must be significantly reduced and that the industry must be 10% more energy efficient by 2030.  “Large renewable energy projects such as those at ArcelorMittal Belgium are necessary in order to put in place a real energy transition. It makes a big difference to a company’s energy bill, but also to the achievement of the renewable energy targets in Flanders. Many companies in the Ghent port area realize that this change of our mindsets is crucial and we are therefore pleased to see that the concrete implementation of the Energy Vision is being taken seriously.” Lydia Peeters, Flemish Deputy Prime Minister and Flemish Minister of Finance, Budget, Energy & Culture.  “I am pleased that ArcelorMittal continues to focus on the reduction of CO2 reduction and energy efficiency. The investment in this new solar park is one of their projects to achieve the ultimate goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050. In this way, our industry is working towards a sustainable and climate-neutral society.” Koen van den Heuvel, Flemish Minister of the Environment, Nature and Agriculture  “The city of Ghent and the North Sea Port are committed to renewable energy, CO2 reduction and reuse. By installing solar panels and solar parks in the cross-border port area, like at ArcelorMittal in Ghent, the port companies are generating renewable energy which is injected into the electricity grid, accounting for the equivalent of more than 31,000 households. In this way, our port is increasingly becoming a sustainable Energy Port, and together with all port companies, we are building a climate-neutral city by 2050.” Mathias De Clercq, mayor of the city of Ghent  ArcelorMittal Belgium continues to work on similar projects at its sites in Liège, Genk and Geel.

{"id":6468,"text":"Announced at the World Steel Association’s annual dinner in Monterrey, Mexico, the nod distinguishes the company’s industry leadership on sustainability amid the growing pressure steel companies are facing to outline their approach to reducing carbon emissions.      The award was given in recognition of the company’s publication of the steel sector’s first Climate Action report in May 2019. The report set out the three pathways the company believes can lead to deep decarbonisation of steelmaking, the various low-emissions technologies the company is trialling and the public policy required to make low-emissions steel a reality. It also confirms ArcelorMittal’s commitments to the objectives of the Paris Agreement and outlines the company’s ambition to significantly reduce emissions across the group, including reaching carbon neutrality in Europe by 2050.      Accepting the Steelie, Brian Aranha, executive vice president, head of strategy, CTO, R&D, CCM, global automotive, communications and corporate responsibility said:      “I am delighted to be able to collect this award for the third year in a row, particularly as I am told that the jury voted unanimously that ArcelorMittal should win it. We are immensely proud of the forward-thinking resource our people have put together to build stakeholder understanding of what a transition to a low-carbon steel industry means in practice. Although the report does not have all the answers, it is prompting some very important conversations with our stakeholders across the steel industry and beyond. Having these conversations will be essential to develop the collaborative approach the world needs to take if we are to unlock the full potential of the steel industry’s efforts to decarbonise. This includes working with governments around the world to develop consistent and supportive policy frameworks to enable our industry to succeed in meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement.”      The Climate Action report is available to download here.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Worldsteel acknowledges ArcelorMittal’s excellence in sustainability","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"For the third consecutive year, ArcelorMittal has won the Steelie Award for excellence in sustainability.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-oct-16-worldsteel-acknowledges-arcelormittal-s-excellence-in-sustainability-1\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6469,"text":"Additionally, company representatives have co-authored a CTBUH research paper titled: Steel and Skyscrapers: A Productive History and a Sustainable Future; and during the event will contribute presentations on Steel and Skyscrapers: A Partnership Through Time and The Sustainability of Steel; as well as moderating a panel discussion about High-Rise Design Drivers: Now to 2069.  The CTBUH is the world’s leading resource for professionals focused on the inception, design, construction, and operation of tall buildings and future cities. As a member of this association, ArcelorMittal has a major role in influencing steel’s contribution to the urban environment and is at the forefront of discussions regarding design codes and standards for tall building construction.  ArcelorMittal, as the first producer of wide-flange rolled shapes such as “H” and “I” beams, has helped to make steel accessible, affordable and durable. Such advances in steelmaking technologies have made tall buildings’ structural skeletons more efficient and have simplified the fabrication and construction processes necessary to build iconic buildings around the world. In doing so, the company (and its legacy businesses) have established a longstanding relationship with the construction industry.  The fact that the built environment is responsible for 39% of global energy-related CO2 emissions and more than 35% of global final energy use, it is not lost on us. ArcelorMittal’s sustainable development outcomes are influenced by the way we make steel and use resources, as well as the way our products are used.  So, in addition to our commitment to lowering our carbon footprint by 2050, ArcelorMittal works with CTBUH to measure the sustainability impact of steel and to equip tall building designers with research on materials, design methodologies and construction typologies that can lower the environmental impact of building projects. Recent studies include: Whole Life Cycle Assessment of the Sustainable Aspects of Structural Systems in Tall Buildings; Composite Megacolumns design methodology; and research focused on creating industry-accepted criteria for measuring tall building floor area. In-depth exploration of these studies, and a case study demonstrating how ArcelorMittal’s steelmaking advancements have directly influenced sustainable outcomes, are summarised in the previously mentioned CTBUH research paper and will also be addressed in our World Congress presentations.  The promotion and dissemination of these studies – in parallel with continuous improvements in our production practices – demonstrate ArcelorMittal’s commitment to supporting the design and construction industry as it strives to address the unintended consequences of using fossil fuels and to achieve sustainable development now and in the future.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal sponsors CTBUH's tenth World Congress","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal is proud to sponsor Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) as it marks its 50th anniversary at the 10th World Congress, “50 Forward | 50 Back”.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-oct-29-arcelormittal-sponsors-ctbuh-s-tenth-world-congress\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Effective on 3 November 2019, the Italian Parliament has removed the legal protection necessary for the Company to implement its environmental plan without the risk of criminal liability, thus justifying the withdrawal notice.  In addition, the decisions issued by the criminal court of Taranto bind the Ilva extraordinary Commissioners to complete certain prescriptions by 13 December 2019 – a term the Commissioners themselves deemed impossible to meet – failing which blast furnace number 2 will be shut down. Such prescriptions should also reasonably and prudentially be applied to the other two blast furnaces at the Taranto plant. The shutdown would make it impossible for the Company to implement its industrial plan, operate the Taranto plant and, generally, perform the Agreement.  Other serious occurrences, independent of the Company’s will, have also led to a situation of legal and operational uncertainty that has further significantly impaired the ability to carry out the necessary operations at Ilva and operate the Taranto plant.   All the mentioned circumstances also entitle the Company to terminate the Agreement under the applicable provisions and principles of the Italian Civil Code.

{"id":6482,"text":"“Europe’s commitment to reduce its carbon emissions to be net-zero should be applauded and we commend the leadership of Mrs von der Leyen and her team. However, the Green Deal will only work if there is full-scale transformation and support for industries.”  “The climate challenge is unprecedented, and bold action is therefore needed. Achieving our ambition of being carbon neutral by 2050 is a major challenge, but with the right political framework - allowing European steelmakers to remain competitive while the steel industry moves to carbon-neutral steelmaking - we’re convinced it’s achievable. The proposal for a carbon border adjustment, which effectively puts a carbon price on imports, recognizes that every country needs to play its part in reducing global CO2 emissions. By preventing steel production moving to countries where carbon emissions legislation is less strict, and where carbon emissions are therefore higher, means we put a stop to carbon leakage. This is exactly the type of action that is needed.”  While support for a carbon border adjustment has been growing in recent months, ArcelorMittal was one of the first companies to support a proposed carbon border adjustment and backs the European Commission’s proposals for a €35 billion ‘just transition’ fund, to invest in research, innovation and green technology.

{"id":6484,"text":"ArcelorMittal holds 60 per cent of AM\/NS India, with Nippon Steel holding the balance.  Aditya Mittal, President and CFO of ArcelorMittal, has been appointed Chairman of AM\/NS India, and Dilip Oommen has been appointed AM\/NS India’s CEO.  Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal, said:  “The acquisition of Essar Steel is an important strategic step for ArcelorMittal. India has long been identified as an attractive market for our company and we have been looking at suitable opportunities to build a meaningful production presence in the country for over a decade. Both India and Essar’s appeal are enduring. Essar has sizeable, profitable, well-located operations and the long-term growth potential for the Indian economy and therefore Indian steel demand are well known. The transaction also demonstrates how India benefits from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, a genuinely progressive reform whose positive impact will be felt widely across the Indian economy.  “We are also delighted to be embarking on this together with Nippon Steel, with whom we have a trusted, long-term relationship. Our combined strengths and technology will bring many new opportunities which will allow us to make a positive contribution to India’s target to grow steelmaking capacity to 300 million tonnes per annum by 2030, and for its manufacturing sector more broadly.”  Eiji Hashimoto, Representative Director and President of Nippon Steel, said:  “AM\/NS India manufactures flat steel, steel plates and steel pipes mainly at its integrated steel mill with nominal crude steel production capacity of 9.6 million tonnes per year in India, one of the most promising steel markets in the world. The company also has a wide-ranging domestic sales network and manufacturing plants in east India producing pellets, a raw material of steel.  “Nippon Steel and ArcelorMittal will bring out AM\/NS India’s potential by providing it with their respective business experience and world-leading advanced technologies, so as to promptly implement the resolution plan and realise its further business expansion. I am confident that AM\/NS India will play a significant role in the development of India’s steel industry, as one of its participants.  “For years Nippon Steel has been making direct investments in many countries, including Brazil, the United States, China and ASEAN countries, in areas where we can take advantage of our advanced technology contributing steadily to the industrial development and the enhancement of the self-sufficiency in each host country. We will strive to establish a prominent presence in India, conforming with its policy to increase domestically-produced steel products.”  Aditya Mittal, President and CFO of ArcelorMittal, added:  “India is a large and strategic market and we are delighted to be here. Our aim is to create sustainable and long-term value by becoming a leading steel manufacturer in the country. Essar Steel has quality facilities which provide us with immediate and substantial production capacity, and we also gain an excellent platform for further growth, across both volume and product quality. This acquisition gives us the opportunity to contribute to India’s expansion in infrastructure and urbanization in the coming decades. To do this, we have in place a targeted capital expenditure plan designed to build on our combined management strength, operational expertise, commitment to safe, sustainable steelmaking and industry-leading research and development. Through our proven partnership with Nippon Steel, we are confident that AM\/NS India will create significant value – for shareholders, our business partners, employees and communities in India.”  AM\/NS India is an integrated flat steel producer, and the largest steel company in western India. Its current level of annualised crude steel production is c. 7.5 million tonnes. It also has iron ore pellet facilities in the east of India, with current annual capacity of 14 million tonnes per annum. AM\/NS India’s plans include:    * An intention to increase finished steel shipments to 8.5 million tonnes over the medium-term. This will be achieved by initially completing ongoing capital expenditure projects and infusing expertise and best practice to deliver efficiency gains, and then through the commissioning of additional assets, while simultaneously improving product quality and grades to realise better margins;   * A long-term aspiration to increase finished steel shipments to between 12 and 15 million tonnes through the addition of new iron and steelmaking assets, in order that AM\/NS India can play an active role and fully benefit from the anticipated growth in the Indian steel industry.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel complete acquisition of Essar Steel","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal announces that it has today completed the acquisition of Essar Steel India Limited (‘ESIL’), and simultaneously established a joint venture with Nippon Steel Corporation (‘Nippon Steel’), called ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Limited (‘AM\/NS India’), which will own and operate ESIL.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-and-nippon-steel-complete-acquisition\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

This puts ArcelorMittal amongst the top 11% of companies within our industry, and compares favourably against the Global average of C, Europe regional average of C, and the Metal smelting, refining & forming sector average of C.  Designed to harness the competitive spirit of business to raise ambition and spur action on corporate climate action, CDP scores thousands of companies that disclose climate data through its platform each year at the request of their corporate customers and investors.  The positive score reflects CDP’s assessment of ArcelorMittal’s ambition to significantly reduce its carbon footprint by 2050, our disclosure of climate related financial risks and opportunities, and our work on a broad portfolio of low-emissions technologies designed to reduce carbon emissions, including:    * Carbalyst – captures waste gases from the blast furnace and biologically convert it into bio-ethanol. The €120m launch project at ArcelorMittal Ghent is expected to be completed in 2020.   * IGAR – captures waste CO2 from the blast furnace and converts it into a synthetic gas that can be reinjected into the blast furnace in place of fossil fuels to reduce iron ore. An industrial pilot of this technology is being developed at ArcelorMittal Dunkirk in France.   * Torero – €40m investment to convert waste wood into bio-coal to displace the fossil fuel coal currently injected into the blast furnace. Our first large scale demonstration plant in ArcelorMittal Ghent is expected to be in operation by the end of 2020.   * Reducing iron ore with hydrogen – €65m investment at Hamburg site to increase the use of hydrogen for the direct reduction of iron ore.Carbon capture and storage – integrating breakthrough technologies to bring down the costs of capturing, purifying and liquifying CO2 from waste gases. Construction of a carbon capture and storage pilot project, 3D, will begin at ArcelorMittal Dunkirk in 2020 and will be able to capture 0.5 metric tons of CO2 an hour from steelmaking gases by 2021.   * Steligence solutions to aid the design and delivery of low carbon buildings   * S-in motion® range of solutions to reduce the weight of (electric) cars and trucks without compromising on strength, and our iCARe® specialist steels for electric motors.

{"id":6495,"text":"Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal. Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Steel is a material that has played a vital role in building the infrastructure of our world and much of what makes modern life more comfortable and accessible. As we now seek to transition to a more circular and sustainable world, I am convinced that steel has a central role to play and will continue to for decades to come. One of the miracles of steel is that it continues to evolve – half the grades of steel we are producing today didn’t exist ten years ago. And these new grades are being designed to meet expectations for lighter vehicles, new energy systems and more environmentally friendly buildings. That is why we define our purpose as ‘Inventing smarter steels for a better world’.   “Our website is an important point of contact with all our stakeholders including current and future employees, shareholders, customers, communities and civil society more broadly. It has been designed not only to incorporate new technologies and be easily navigable, but also to act as a central hub for all the work the company is doing to create value for our stakeholders. That includes: investing in new processes; inventing new steels for customers; improving efficiency through digitalisation; testing new technologies to reduce our carbon footprint; promoting policy suggestions that will support a transition to a low-carbon world; and offering exciting career opportunities to solve some of the world’s most complex problems.  “The steel industry, understandably, is often associated with the past. I hope this site will serve to reinforce how it is also a vital part of the future.”   A central pillar of the new website is its Smarter future section, which explores the future of steel and its role in a changing world. It includes four episodes from the first season of a new podcast series, ‘Futurising’, which features ArcelorMittal experts in conversation with a futurologist, covering:    * The future of mobility: Brian Aranha, head of automotive, discusses how mobility may change in the future.   * The future of steel manufacturing: Greg Ludkovsky, head of R&D, explores how steel manufacturing will be different in the future, and imagines its reinvention.   * The future of construction: Olivier Vassart, CEO Steligence®, discusses the future of buildings and the role of steel in them.   * Sustainability: Dr Alan Knight, head of sustainable development, reflects on the sustainable nature of steel, and how this positions it as the ideal material for a sustainable future.    The website contains case studies which outline how ArcelorMittal is embracing the latest technological trends and applying them across its business to deliver efficiency and environmental improvements. Examples include:    * How we are looking at all possible technology pathways to reduce our carbon footprint.   * How steels are supporting the global energy transition.   * How ArcelorMittal is making significant investments in resources, time and management attention to understand how it can take advantage of Industry 4.0, and use data and analytics to create value for its customers and to improve its performance.   * How ArcelorMittal’s global R&D team has developed a potato-based, biodegradable dust suppressant, applied as foam, which can reduce secondary sinter dust emissions by more than 80%.   * How artificial intelligence algorithms inspired by the path-finding behaviour of ant colonies in the wild has helped to improve production line scheduling, delivering cost, productivity and quality improvements.    The website also features a Making Steel infographic which outlines the entire steelmaking journey, from mining to ironmaking through to the use of steel in modern life. It also hosts a Corporate library which includes ArcelorMittal’s reporting hub and houses its policies and procedures.  The website can be accessed at http:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com.

{"id":6496,"text":"In a manifesto published today, ‘Creating a low carbon world, the case for a Carbon Border Adjustment’, ArcelorMittal sets out its firm belief that a CBA should be one of the first Green Deal measures adopted by the new European Commission, as it will help to create the market conditions and protections needed for companies to make investments and transition to carbon neutrality without disruption.  Currently within the EU, energy-intensive industries including steel producers, pay a carbon cost under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). But this does not apply to steel producers from markets outside the EU who can sell steel with comparable or often significantly higher, carbon emissions, at a lower price. The result is that steel production is moving to non-EU countries where carbon emissions legislation is often less strict, undermining efforts to combat climate change.   However, with a CBA, when steel comes into the EU, the carbon costs that European producers pay would be added to the imported steel, equalising the cost of carbon for every producer to create a fair market and, crucially, encouraging investment in lower-emissions steel production.  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products says: “The EU’s commitment to reduce its carbon emissions to net-zero should be applauded and we hope that decision makers across Europe will back the proposals as they really could hold the key to unlocking solutions that could put a stop to carbon emissions. The climate challenge is unprecedented, and bold action is needed.”  ArcelorMittal believes that a CBA can be applied in various ways, as long as it neutralizes the disparities in carbon costs between domestic products and imports, and incentivizes the transition to low carbon steel production. In the manifesto, ArcelorMittal highlights how the best-designed carbon border adjustment could work effectively:  Producers exporting to the EU should be charged the same marginal carbon emissions cost as European producers pay under the ETS. This should serve as a catalyst to other countries to introduce their own carbon schemes and invest in technologies to decarbonise.  The CBA should initially be applied to primary goods, rather than end products like household appliances and everyday tools. This is the most practical way to introduce the CBA.  To be effective, free allocation of ETS allowances, which are gradually being phased out by the European Commission, should be maintained in the first stage of the CBA, alongside compensation for high energy costs as an indirect result of the ETS. This is crucial to enabling European steel to stay competitive and ensure a smooth transition without disruption.  He says: “There are of course challenges that will need to be overcome. For example, some have argued that there is the risk of contravening international trade rules. However, the establishment of a border adjustment is compatible with international trade rules, allowing members to adopt measures necessary for the protection of the environment or relating to the conservation of natural resources providing that such measures do not constitute arbitrary discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail. But this will only work if the policies are well-designed and drafted in the right way.”   He also says: “We know we need to invest more to decarbonise our industry and we truly believe we can be a world leader in low carbon steel. But in order to do so, we need to have a CBA to create a landscape where others also contribute equally to a carbon-neutral world. The time to do this is now, with the proceeds allowing further investment in large-scale green technologies that lead to a new era of low carbon emissions.”   For more information, to read the manifesto and view our short animation on the CBA, see here:  https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/sustainability\/climate-action-in-europe  Contact information – ArcelorMittal Europe communications  [email protected]  +44 203 214 2876  [email protected]  +44 203 214 2882","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Europe’s proposed carbon border adjustment could hold the key to breakthrough on CO2 emissions reduction","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today calls for member states and MEPs to support the introduction of a carbon border adjustment (CBA), as part of the European Commission’s €1 trillion Green Deal, aimed at making the bloc carbon neutral by 2050.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/europe-s-proposed-carbon-border-adjustment-could-hold-the-key-to-breakthrough-on-co2-emissions-reduction\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6499,"text":"Firstly, we would like to recognise the resilience and flexibility of our global workforce, whose health and well-being is our first priority. Where possible, employees are working remotely from home. Where assets continue to operate, we are following the recommendations from government as well as the World Health Organisation (‘WHO’). We appreciate this brings new challenges for everyone and are working together as a community to support each other through these unprecedented times.   The global escalation of COVID-19 and the measures introduced by governments worldwide to contain the virus are negatively impacting economic activity and industrial supply chains in many parts of the world. Consequently, we are either seeing or expect to see a significant decline in industrial activity in many if not all of the geographic markets in which we operate, which is impacting our business.   In response we are reducing production and temporary idling steelmaking and finishing assets, adapted on a country by country basis in alignment with regional demand as well as government requirements. This will not necessarily happen uniformly at assets across the globe given the escalation of the virus is at different points in different regions. While Europe is currently the epicenter, according to official WHO data cases in the NAFTA region have now exceeded those in China, with cases also increasing in Africa, India, South America and the CIS. Where demand for our products continues, for example for food packaging, we will endeavour to maintain reduced operations to ensure we can meet customer’s requirements.  In order to mitigate the impact of the lower level of production we are implementing significant measures to preserve cash and reduce costs in-line with reduced production levels. This includes accessing measures introduced by governments to support companies throughout these unprecedented times. We are thankful to all governments for their swift introduction of such measures which will be critical to many industries as we navigate this period.   The current market volatility and uncertainty is tough for every country, every individual and every company. We are however buoyed by the fact our company has in recent years prioritised the strengthening of its balance sheet to provide a strong financial foundation in all market conditions. Net debt is at a record low, we have a very manageable debt maturity profile having used available cash to prepay debt in recent years and also benefit from a significant liquidity position. We intend to provide updated guidance on our 2020 cash requirements, including capital expenditure, when we announce our first quarter 2020 results on 7 May 2020. In order to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees, shareholders and stakeholders, we have however decided to postpone the AGM planned for 5 May 2020. A new date will be communicated in due course.   Like many in the private sector, we are attempting to harness our skills and resources in a useful and collaborative way to help address the challenges presented by COVID-19. Specifically, we have focussed our actions on collaborating to address the severe lack of the required safety and medical equipment, including face masks and ventilators. Our businesses across the world have now collectively donated to various initiatives. We have also been utilising our global network to help facilitate the transfer of equipment to and from regions most impacted. For example, in February we actively helped source masks for China. Now that China appears to have passed its peak, we are working with our associates there to help bring medical equipment to the countries now facing an escalation and particularly those, such as India and Liberia, that will struggle to source adequate supplies.  Furthermore, we have also been able to contribute the 3D printing expertise of our R&D team to a global effort focussed on developing a 3D printed ventilator prototype. This prototype will be tested imminently in hospitals and, if successful, will massively increase the ability to rapidly produce ventilators. We are now focussed on the prototype for a more advanced ventilator which also has the ability, in addition to providing lungs with oxygen, to feeding medicine incorporating AI algorithms.   Finally, where excess capacity exists, we are offering space to medical facilities to host additional wards. We are proud of the initiatives our employees are taking to provide social and humanitarian support during this time.

{"id":6508,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’), the world’s leading steel and mining company, has today published its 2019 integrated annual review, ‘Inventing smarter steels for a better world’. The review, which can be accessed at https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/corporate-library\/reporting-hub\/integrated-annual-review-2019, underpins the Company’s commitment to transparent reporting. It has been produced in-line with the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework and demonstrates the Company’s approach to ensuring it brings long-term, sustainable value to its broad stakeholder base.  The review provides an overview of the progress the Company made in 2019 and outlines how it is addressing its challenges. Specifically, the review details how ArcelorMittal performed last year across four distinct areas, namely: health and safety performance; delivering financial value; innovating smarter steels and solutions; and driving environmental and social sustainability.  Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “I am fundamentally optimistic about the long-term outlook for steel because, as the world’s population further increases and living standards continue to improve for everyone, demand for materials will also increase. Our product is also an integral component in much of the infrastructure that will support a net zero carbon economy, including wind and solar farms, electric vehicles and low-carbon buildings. But we also need to work to significantly reduce our direct carbon footprint. Beyond the challenge of trialling and scaling up potential technologies, the biggest hurdle will be the significantly higher costs which cannot be supported by the profitability of the industry alone. This is why policy intervention is so critical, both to provide access to finance as well as to ensure a level playing field.  “As steelmaking develops, it is important to also develop the skills of our employees and to ensure we can retain and attract the people we need for continued success. We have already strengthened our digitalisation teams and are also boosting our research and development teams with 3D printing experts as we explore the potential for printing steel from steel powders. We believe the steel industry offers interesting and complex challenges, and ArcelorMittal an entrepreneurial, global environment in which to grow and prosper.  “Undoubtedly there will be significant COVID-19 repercussions for some time to come. But I do expect the fundamentals to reassert themselves, for the world to continue with its development, to continue to grow, to continue to want to give a better quality of life to more people, and to continue to prioritise sustainability. There will be challenges, as there are always challenges, but steel has a critical role to play in the world of the future as it has in the world of the past. And I am sure ArcelorMittal, as the world’s leading and only global steel company, will continue to be a material supplier of choice, inventing smarter steels for the better world we all hope to see.”  Key highlights of ArcelorMittal’s sustainable development approach and progress discussed in the review include:    * The steps the Company is taking to address its carbon challenge, encapsulated in our commitment to supporting the objectives of the Paris Agreement, and our ambition to significantly reduce emissions across the group, including a 30% reduction in carbon emissions in Europe by 2030, and carbon neutrality in Europe by 2050.         * An overview of the first full year of Steligence®, our radical new concept for the use of steel in construction. This facilitates the next generation of high-performance buildings and sustainable construction techniques. It is already proving highly successful, having delivered 16 million m2 of building and nearly 500,000 tonnes of steel so far.         * The importance the Company places on R&D, insight into how our $301 million R&D budget was allocated in 2019 and a spotlight on our work with Canoo to create a disruptive new vehicle for a world in which transportation is becoming increasingly electric, shared and autonomous.         * How, in 2019, we avoided the emission of more than 11 million tonnes CO2 in the cement industry through the sale of 15 million tonnes of blast furnace slag for use as cement – 19% more than in 2018. In 2019, our absolute CO2e footprint for our steel and mining operations saw a 4% decrease against 2018, and for our steel operations, a 4.5% decrease.         * We are reducing our direct emissions from energy consumption. In 2019, 44% of our electricity was generated from renewable sources and through onsite generation.     * A summary of value creation for stakeholders in 2019, in the Company’s value creation model. Examples include:      * $72.2 billion economic contribution.     * $4.5 billion total tax contribution.     * $30.3 million total community investment spend.     * Allocated a total of $711 million to 25 projects with energy and\/or carbon benefits.     * Approved a total of 38 projects with environmental benefits totaling $692 million.     * 69 inventions newly protected and 42 sustainable products and solutions launched, 11 of which accelerate sustainable lifestyles and 31 of which support sustainable construction, infrastructure and energy generation.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes 2019 integrated annual review","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal publishes 2019 integrated annual review","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-publishes-2019-integrated-annual-review-1\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6509,"text":"The accolade for 2019 maintains ArcelorMittal’s perfect run as a Steel Sustainability Champion, since the programme was launched in 2017.

{"id":6510,"text":"* Europe’s largest steelmaker, unveils breakthrough technologies that will take the company to 30% lower CO2 emissions by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 2050     * ArcelorMittal Europe is investing in two routes to carbon neutrality, Smart Carbon and an innovative DRI-based route, in recognition of the need to act now to reduce CO2 emissions, in line with the EU’s Green Deal and the Paris Agreement   * Calls for new policy framework, to support the industry in its transition to carbon neutrality, naming five market conditions that are needed for Europe’s steelmakers to compete globally     ArcelorMittal Europe has announced details of how it plans to become carbon neutral by 2050 in its first climate action report, published today. Building on the company’s work that has demonstrated that the steelmaking process can become carbon neutral, the report publishes details of the ground-breaking work underway to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030 before reaching net zero in 2050.  The company is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral routes for steelmaking: Smart Carbon, and an innovative DRI-based route.  Smart Carbon is a carbon-neutral steelmaking route that leverages all clean energies – circular carbon, clean electricity and carbon capture and storage (CCS) - within the high temperature-controlled reduction environment of ironmaking. In its first phase, Smart Carbon will primarily use circular carbon.  Reaching carbon-neutral steelmaking via DRI involves moving from using predominantly natural gas, to hydrogen as the key reductant in ironmaking. As this hydrogen becomes ‘green’, the steelmaking process comes close to carbon neutrality.  While both the Smart Carbon route and the DRI-based route have the potential to deliver carbon -neutral steel by 2050, the important difference between the two routes is that Smart Carbon can deliver results sooner, through its use of complementary technologies which enable incremental progress. Uniquely, Smart Carbon has the potential not only to provide carbon-neutral steel, but also carbon-neutral cement, and the building blocks to make recycled carbon materials to replace polyethylene-based plastics. Smart Carbon can also contribute to CO2 removal, through the increased use of circular carbon, using sustainable biomass and waste, combined with scaling up CCS.  By investing in both routes – and in recognition of the need to act now to combat climate change - this means ArcelorMittal Europe can significantly reduce scope 1 CO2 emissions* – which include all process emissions - by 2030 over a 2018 baseline, while waiting for the large-scale, affordable renewable energy needed for hydrogen-based steelmaking.  ArcelorMittal Europe’s 2030 target therefore combines Smart Carbon technologies and increased scrap usage, specifically by developing new ways to increase the use of low-quality scrap metal – which is hard to recycle - in the primary steel production process.  In the longer-term, both routes have the potential to leverage all three clean energies to achieve carbon neutrality, namely:    * clean electricity (generated by sources such as solar and wind),   * circular carbon (making use of biowaste materials, such as sustainable forestry and agriculture residues, to produce bioenergy)   * carbon capture and storage (capturing CO2 before it is emitted, transporting it and storing it safely underground).    Commenting on the report, Aditya Mittal, President and CFO, ArcelorMittal, and CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said:  “Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing us all. Understandably, much attention is currently focussed on navigating the unexpected and unprecedented outbreak of Covid-19. However, climate change remains a huge long-term challenge that will require diligent attention and progress for decades to come. And like Covid-19, it is not something that one country or one company can solve alone. Carbon emissions also know no border, so it will take a global effort, with all nations and companies playing their part.  “ArcelorMittal Europe is doing a lot of work to develop a path to net zero. The technologies we are working on have the potential to make a big impact. Indeed, steel should and can play a leading role in achieving the vision for Europe as outlined in the Green Deal. Our research and development team are one of the best in the industry and relish solving complex problems. But it needs a team effort. The support the EU and member states can give to ensure we have well-designed policy to make large-scale, competitive, carbon-neutral steelmaking a reality, is critical.”  ArcelorMittal Europe has industrial-scale demonstration projects under construction for every part of its carbon-neutral roadmap. The company is building industrial-scale demonstration plants at its operations in Belgium (Carbalyst® and Torero), France (3D and IGAR in Dunkirk). In Hamburg, Germany, we are in the design and funding phase prior to the investment decision, of an industrial-scale project to use hydrogen instead of natural gas in the direct reduction of iron ore (DRI). These demonstration plants will allow the company to scale-up technologies that will be used in the Smart Carbon and DRI-based routes. The progress made has also been possible thanks to financial support from EU member states and European Union funding. ArcelorMittal Europe is now in the process of applying for funding for a further six projects.   While some of the technologies that feature in ArcelorMittal Europe’s roadmap will be ready for commercial-scale use by 2025, and by 2030 many of the Smart Carbon technologies can be mature and partially deployed across our facilities in Europe, the report also highlights the need for the right policy framework to enable European steelmaking to contribute to the EU’s climate targets, particularly given the costs involved. In total, the estimated investment needed for ArcelorMittal Europe to fully implement Smart Carbon is €15-25bn and €30-40bn for the DRI-based route. An additional €15–200bn would be required for the associated clean energy infrastructure (see report for more detail).  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, explained:  “I am proud of the work that has brought us this far in our efforts to create Europe’s first and largest carbon-neutral steelmaker. Our progress would not have been possible without the many partners we have on our Smart Carbon and innovative DRI projects. Today, the biggest barrier to transitioning to carbon-neutral steel, beyond the necessary technologies reaching commercial maturity, is the absence of the right market conditions. The financial costs of realising carbon-neutral steelmaking are undeniably huge. However, with a shift in market conditions brought about by having the right policies in place, European steelmakers will be able to unlock the means to reduce emissions from steel globally, while also ensuring the European steel industry remains competitive.”  The medium-term market conditions needed include:    1. Creating an environment where carbon-neutral steel is more competitive than steel which is not carbon neutral         2. A fair competitive landscape that accounts for the global nature of the steel market, addressing domestic, import and export steel dynamics, as well as the distinction between primary and secondary sources to make steel.         3. Access to sustainable finance, to innovate and make long-term investments.         4. Access to abundant, affordable clean energy: the scale of the steel industry’s energy needs are such that concerted cross-sector and government efforts will be required to develop the necessary clean energy infrastructure.         5. Public instruments to accelerate innovative technology deployment to transition to carbon neutral steelmaking.    The report also reiterates the company’s position that a Carbon Border Adjustment should be introduced in the European Union, which would ensure that EU-produced steel and imported steel tonnes in direct competition would have an equal carbon cost, creating a fair market and, crucially, encouraging investment in lower-emissions steel production.  ArcelorMittal Europe announced its target to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, in December 2019, and its ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050, in June 2019.  The ArcelorMittal group will publish its 2030 target later this year.   *ArcelorMittal Europe 30% CO2 reduction target includes: ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products, and Industeel  To read the report and view a short film about our roadmap, visit https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/sustainability\/climate-action-in-europe  To view our Carbon Border Adjustment animation, ‘Creating a low-carbon world, the case for a Carbon Border Adjustment’ visit https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T-iJeVoa7w0","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe sets out path to net zero by 2050, with pioneering technologies at the forefront of the company’s roadmap for carbon-neutral steelmaking","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe sets out path to net zero by 2050, with pioneering technologies at the forefront of the company’s roadmap for carbon-neutral steelmaking","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-sets-out-path-to-net-zero-by-2050-with-pioneering-technologies-at-the-forefront-of-the-company-s-roadmap-for-carbon-neutral-steelmaking\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The Deal of the Year award recognises the challenges, financial results, leadership, scope and strategic vision of asset buyouts, joint ventures, strategic company alliances or full company mergers or acquisitions, as well as strategic spin-offs that strengthened organisations. The awards program, hosted by S&P Global Platts, the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodities and energy markets, saw 96 finalists from 23 countries vie for recognition in 15 categories.  AM\/NS India's acquisition of Essar Steel India stood out for the Deal of the Year award as it was the largest private-sector transaction to close in India during 2019, and the second-largest steel transaction globally that year.  ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel faced intense competition from other interested parties in Essar, as well as a multiplicity of legal challenges in India, even at the Supreme Court.  Confident of the strong strategic rationale for the transaction and the potential for the partners to turn around Essar Steel, AM\/NS India remained committed and resolute throughout the 865-day long process, emerging as the winner of an auction with all legal obstacles resolved.  The acquisition provides both ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel a sizeable entry into the high-growth Indian steel market, where steel consumption is expected to grow on average around 6% annually over the next 10-15 years. Neither joint venture partner had any production capability in India before the acquisition.

{"id":6516,"text":"Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal said:  “An electric arc furnace at Calvert makes strategic sense as it allows our asset to be more reactive to the local market as well as being in line with the USMCA. Furthermore, it aligns with our ambition of producing smarter steels for a better world.”  Commenting, Brad Davey, CEO, ArcelorMittal North America said:  “The addition of an EAF at AM\/NS Calvert presents a transformational opportunity for what is already widely considered to be the world’s most advanced steel finishing facility. This is a logical next step in optimizing AM\/NS Calvert’s supply chain. Enhancing our already highly competitive lead times with short lead-time flexibility, combined with our existing world class facilities will give AM\/NS Calvert a decisive competitive advantage. In addition, the USMCA trade agreement is a “game changer” for former NAFTA and as a result, future steel supply chains for the automotive markets will be required to use steel that was created within North America. A new EAF at AM\/NS Calvert will further secure ArcelorMittal’s leadership in the North American Automotive market.”  AM\/NS Calvert is the world’s most advanced steel finishing facility and further demonstrates the highly successful partnership between ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel Corporation. AM\/NS Calvert was originally built by Thyssenkrupp, with a total investment cost ~$4B USD and was acquired by ArcelorMittal and NSC as a 50:50 JV in 2014. The J\/V has already invested more than $200M USD in strategic projects invested in Calvert since its acquisition. These capabilities, geographic location in combination with the new EAF will position the facility well for meeting automotive and energy market demand well into the future.  ### Press Contacts  North America: Bill Steers; +1 312 899 3817; [email protected]","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal announces intention to build an EAF at AM\/NS Calvert","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Today, ArcelorMittal announced its intention to build an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steel making facility at AM\/NS Calvert.

{"id":6517,"text":"We believe pursuing both routes to carbon neutrality is an advantage, as it means we can significantly reduce our scope 1 CO2 emissions, which include all process emissions, by 2030, without having to wait for the large-scale, affordable, renewable energy needed for hydrogen-based steelmaking. Urgent action to reduce CO2 emissions is needed within the next decade, and with our roadmap to 2030, we recognise that the time is now.  Having the right policies to support Europe’s steel industry to become carbon neutral is paramount. ArcelorMittal Europe therefore welcomes the European Commission’s policy proposals, outlined in its 2030 Climate Target Plan announced on 17 September 2020, which – if successfully implemented – will provide a supportive policy framework for the company to achieve its climate targets.   We believe there are four key policy enablers that are needed, to provide the legislative platform for ArcelorMittal Europe to achieve its climate targets:  1\\. The Carbon Border Adjustment - a key policy mechanism for decarbonisation, while also creating a fair competitive landscape by aligning the carbon costs of EU domestic steel producers with that of imports.   Therefore, the European Commission’s announcement that a legislative proposal will be made in 2021 to introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA) Mechanism, is a significant step forward in recognising that a supportive policy framework is needed as soon as possible. The CBA can be designed in a WTO-compatible way, a fact that we hope will ensure a CBA is implemented swiftly.  2\\. Access to abundant and affordable clean energy, to enable the roll-out of low-emissions steelmaking.   The EC’s proposals in its 2030 Climate Target Plan, to further increase the EU’s share of renewable energy by making it easier for member states to work together and deploy renewable energy projects, is encouraging.  3\\. Access to sustainable finance for low-emissions steelmaking.   We are hopeful that our submissions for funding from the newly-created ETS Innovation Fund are successful, and welcome the EU’s plan to develop a reliable EU Green Bond Standard.  4\\. Accelerate the transition to a circular economy: EU climate and materials policy should be integrated, taking a lifecycle perspective to ensure that materials are used in a circular way as much as possible.   The European Commission’s announcement yesterday that it wants to make Europe a leader in the circular economy is therefore positive progress.  As the Commission works on the detail of its Green Deal over the coming weeks, we hope that the final proposals recognise the value of steel to modern society, as an infinitely recyclable material that has the proven potential to be made with zero emissions.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal welcomes European Commission’s policy proposals to support new emissions reduction target   ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe is working intensively to achieve its target of reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, with an ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050.

{"id":6521,"text":"Commenting on the 2050 net zero target, before speaking about the challenge of decarbonising the steel industry at the Financial Times Commodities Conference today, Aditya Mittal, President and CFO, said:   “If the world is to achieve net zero by 2050 it will require all parts of the economy in all regions of the world to contribute. As the world’s leading steel company, we believe we have a responsibility to lead the efforts to decarbonise the steel-making process, which today has a significant carbon footprint.   “Steel will remain a vital material for our world and indeed is the most circular of all materials. Our challenge is to be able to make steel using clean energy technologies* on a commercial scale, while remaining competitive in the global steel industry.  “We are working on various pilot technologies which have excellent potential. In Hamburg, where we own and operate Europe’s only DRI-EAF facility, we will test not only the ability of hydrogen to reduce the iron-ore and form DRI, but also then test that carbon-free DRI in the EAF in the actual steel-making process.  “Hydrogen has a lot of potential but given the significant transition cost, we also believe in working on solutions for the traditional integrated route. This essentially follows the bio-energy, carbon capture and utilisation and storage route, which as stressed by both the IPCC and the IEA will be critical to achieving net zero by 2050. What is also interesting about this route is that it has the potential not only to provide carbon neutral steel, but also other products that will help the chemical industry make plastics in a carbon neutral way.   “Critical to turning the target into reality will be policy to enable steel to remain competitive while decarbonizing – particularly given every region of the world is moving at a different pace. We intend to actively engage with governments to chart a way forward that enables the steel industry to make meaningful progress through carefully designed policy that protects against carbon leakage.”  ArcelorMittal has identified two low-emissions steelmaking routes, both of which have the potential to lead to carbon-neutral steelmaking:    * The Hydrogen-DRI route, which uses hydrogen as a reducing agent. A demonstration plant in Hamburg, where ArcelorMittal owns Europe’s only operational DRI-EAF plant, is currently planned with a targeted start-up in 2023.     * The Smart Carbon route is centred around modifying the blast furnace route to create carbon neutral steelmaking through the use of circular carbon - in the form of sustainable biomass or carbon containing waste streams - and carbon capture and use (CCU) and storage (CCS). ArcelorMittal is well advanced on constructing several commercial-scale projects to test and prove a range of Smart Carbon technologies. Start-up target for key projects is targeted in 2022.    While both routes have the potential to deliver carbon-neutral steel by 2050, we believe that Smart Carbon can deliver results sooner, and make a meaningful contribution to CO2 emissions reduction this decade, while industrial scale production from the Hydrogen-DRI route is unlikely to be significant before 2030 due to the current high costs.  The Company has also previously outlined the policy framework environment it believes is required for carbon-neutral steelmaking to become a reality, which includes:    1. A global level playing field which avoids the risk of carbon leakage through mechanisms such as green border adjustments   2. Access to abundant and affordable clean energy   3. Policies which support the development of the necessary clean energy infrastructure   4. Access to sustainable finance for low-emissions steelmaking, and   5. Policies which accelerate the transition to a circular economy.    ArcelorMittal will set out further detail in support of its 2050 net zero target in its second climate action report, which is anticipated to be published before the end of 2020.  ArcelorMittal is a member of the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) and is an active member of the ETC’s Net Zero Steel Initiative underway in partnership with the World Economic Forum. ArcelorMittal is also actively engaged with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) to define an achievable SBT for the steel industry taking into account the two distinct routes in operation today.  *In its Climate Action Report and Europe Climate Action Report, ArcelorMittal refers to three clean energy vectors: clean electricity, circular carbon, and CCS.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal sets 2050 group carbon emissions target of net zero ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces a group-wide commitment to being carbon neutral by 2050, building on the commitment made in 2019 for its European business to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030, and be carbon neutral by 2050.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-sets-2050-group-carbon-emissions-target-of-net-zero\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

ArcelorMittal Europe is developing a series of industrial-scale hydrogen projects for use in blast furnace-based steelmaking that will start to deliver substantial CO2 emissions savings even within the next five years, as well as progressing a project to test the ability of hydrogen to reduce iron ore and form DRI on an industrial scale.   Ultimately to reach zero, this hydrogen will need to be ‘green’ (produced via electrolysis which is powered by renewable electricity). ArcelorMittal is therefore developing new facilities to produce green hydrogen using electrolysers. Teams at ArcelorMittal Bremen in Germany are working on the first large-scale deployment of this technology which can then be deployed in both the blast furnace and the DRI-EAF route. Previously, this emerging technology has only been tested at small pilot plants in Europe.  1\\. Hydrogen and the blast furnace    * ArcelorMittal Bremen    By installing an electrolyser, hydrogen can be produced and injected in large volumes into the blast furnace tuyeres. The project will reduce the volumes of coal needed in the iron ore reduction process, thereby cutting CO2 emissions.    * IGAR in Dunkirk    At ArcelorMittal Dunkirk, the company is developing a hybrid blast furnace process, which involves using DRI gas injection technology in the blast furnace shaft as well as using gas injection in the blast furnace tuyeres, using plasma technology to create a reducing gas. This is the first large-scale implementation of what is essentially a hybrid BF\/DRI technology. In due course it will enable green hydrogen to be injected into the blast furnace as it becomes available.     * Blast furnace injection across Flat Products sites     ArcelorMittal Europe is also implementing projects in almost all its Flat Products sites to use gases from different sources for blast furnace injection. Injecting hydrogen-rich coke oven gas is an efficient, cost effective method that allows steelmakers to reduce CO2 emissions now. ArcelorMittal Asturias has the most advanced coke oven gas project, with injection of grey hydrogen (hydrogen that has been recovered from gases including natural gas and coke oven gas) due to start in early 2021.  2\\. Hydrogen and DRI-EAF    * Testing hydrogen to reduce iron ore and form DRI, at ArcelorMittal Hamburg    ArcelorMittal Europe owns Europe’s only DRI-EAF facility in Hamburg, where a project is planned to test the ability of hydrogen to reduce iron ore and form DRI on an industrial scale, as well as testing carbon-free DRI in the EAF steelmaking process.    * Large-scale DRI plant being studied for Dunkirk    At ArcelorMittal Dunkirk a study has been launched to build a large-scale DRI plant, combined with an electric arc furnace. Initially, the DRI installation would use natural gas but ArcelorMittal’s unique experience in DRI production, together with the results of the DRI-hydrogen project in Hamburg mean the DRI installation will be fully ‘hydrogen-ready’.  SMART CARBON WITH HYDROGEN    * Second Carbalyst plant planned, in Fos-sur-Mer; further CO2 cuts with large electrolyser for hydrogen injection    ArcelorMittal is also planning to expand its use of the Smart Carbon technology route. At ArcelorMittal Fos-sur-Mer, France, a study is underway in collaboration with partner Lanzatech, to build a second Carbalyst plant in addition to the one under construction at ArcelorMittal Ghent in Belgium. This involves carbon capture from the blast furnace waste gas, and biologically converting it into ethanol for use as a biofuel or recycled carbon feedstock for the chemical industry. In parallel with the company’s electrolyser project in Bremen, the Carbalyst plant in Fos-sur-Mer will boost CO2 savings through hydrogen injection, supplied by a large-scale electrolyser that will produce the hydrogen locally from renewable electricity.  First verified green steel for customers  The first impact of these decarbonisation efforts means ArcelorMittal Europe will be offering customers green steel products this year, when the first 30,000 tonnes will be ready.  A system that quantifies the CO2 emissions savings made thanks to the decarbonisation projects being rolled out by ArcelorMittal Europe has been developed. Customers will be able to buy green steel, based on verified emissions compared with a 2018 baseline.   Innovation Fund submissions  To fund the capital investment needed for the projects announced today, ArcelorMittal Europe is preparing funding applications to the EU’s Innovation Fund which is designed to support low-carbon investments in the European Union.   Aditya Mittal, President and CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said:   \"Today we are providing an important update on our progress in achieving our target of reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, including the vital role that hydrogen has in our strategy. Our talented teams across ArcelorMittal Europe are working hard to ensure our CO2 emissions reduction projects deliver results as fast as possible, on an industrial scale. We are focussed on being ready for the hydrogen economy and the exciting opportunities this presents for us as European steelmakers.   “In parallel we continue to roll out our Smart Carbon technology which we are convinced also offers huge potential given the world will need so-called BECCS technologies (bio-energy, carbon capture and storage) to reach net zero by 2050.   “Our plans to offer greener and more circular steel will support our customers in their circular economy objectives. We are pleased to be able to offer our first green tonnes this year and look forward to being able to provide customers with larger volumes of this steel as our decarbonisation projects are ramped up and rolled out across Europe.  “We are in the process of applying for funding for various projects from the ETS Innovation Fund which we hope will be successful, giving us the vital access to finance that we need for these important projects. The success of these projects will also be secured through partnerships, and we would like to thank our partners for their hard work and willingness to co-develop the new technologies we need to make carbon-neutral steel.”  ArcelorMittal Europe climate action report  In June 2020, ArcelorMittal Europe published its first climate action report which outlined the company’s strategy for reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.  In the report the company identified two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology routes, Smart Carbon and innovative DRI based on hydrogen, that will help the company reach its CO2 reduction targets.

{"id":6533,"text":"ArcelorMittal has once again been recognised by CDP for its strong performance in corporate transparency and action on climate change. ArcelorMittal successfully retained its A- score in the 2020 CDP Climate Change assessment, putting the company within the top quartile of all metal smelting, refining and forming companies and the top 10% of the steel industry.  CDP, a not-for-profit charity that runs a global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions, scores thousands of companies which disclose climate data through its platform each year. By doing so, the competitive spirit of business to raise ambition and spur action on corporate climate action is harnessed for positive change.   ArcelorMittal’s A- grade is testament to the company’s efforts and contributions towards building a thriving economy that works for people and the planet in the long term. The grade compares favourably to the global average D grade for metal smelting, refining and forming companies, and C grade for the steel sector specifically. ArcelorMittal’s efforts are further reflected in the A grade scores achieved for governance, disclosure of climate related financial risk and opportunities, strategy and planning and emissions reduction initiatives.  Earlier this year, the company announced a group-wide commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2050, while it is targeting a reduction of 30% by 2030 in its European business. ArcelorMittal recognises the important role of disclosing climate related financial risks and opportunities in achieving this goal, as well as developing the company’s two low-emissions technology pathways, Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI.  Commenting, Brian Aranha, Executive Vice President and Head of Strategy, CTO, R&D, CCM, Global Automotive, Communications and Corporate Responsibility, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Receiving an A- from CDP for the second consecutive year is testament to the significant efforts we are making to lead the industry’s efforts to decarbonise steelmaking. Having previously outlined our commitment to the objectives of the Paris agreement, earlier this year we set ourselves the target of being carbon neutral by 2050. To achieve this, we are developing a broad range of ground-breaking, low-emissions steelmaking technologies, with several industrial-scale projects across our European operations at an advanced stage. Our target is ambitious and will be challenging. Meeting it will require a supportive policy framework, but the progress with have made with our technologies provides us with confidence that we are on the right path.”  The full list of companies assessed, as well as other publicly available climate change scores are available on CDP’s website at: https:\/\/www.cdp.net\/en\/companies\/companies-scores","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal ranked at global leadership level on climate action","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Company maintains A- CDP grade for second consecutive year","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-ranked-at-global-leadership-level-on-climate-action\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6538,"text":"Vow subsidiary ETIA and ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products, a leader in the production of sections, sheet piles, rails and quality wire rod, will work together to build the first dedicated biogas plant for the steel industry, using ETIA’s pyrolysis technology, at ArcelorMittal Rodange in Luxembourg. ArcelorMittal Rodange specializes in the production of grooved rails, supplying major rail projects around the world.  The two companies will cooperate on engineering, business models and financing, and aim to have the Rodange biogas plant operational in 2023. The biogas will be made using Vow’s patented ‘Biogreen’ pyrolysis technology, which involves heating sustainable biomass at high temperatures. The gases emitted during this process are then captured and processed into biogas, which will directly replace the use of natural gas in the Rodange plant’s rolling mill reheating furnace. By-products such as bio-coal will also be created during the process, and re-used within ArcelorMittal, directly replacing the use of coal.  The Rodange biogas plant will be ETIA’s first industrial-scale pilot project for this specific application, and the intention is for similar plants to be built in Europe, thereby increasing the CO2 emissions saved from replacing the use of natural gas.  “We are very pleased to be working with VOW ASA, combining our expertise as steelmakers with Vow and ETIA technology, to create this biogas plant for ArcelorMittal Rodange. We see significant potential in the use of biogas as a replacement for natural gas within ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products’ facilities, and in helping us to achieve our ambition of being carbon-neutral by 2050. This technically challenging project is truly ground-breaking, in its ability to create synthetic gas for industrial use, from sustainable biomass.” said Vincent Cholet, CTO of ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products.  “We are very excited and committed to this cooperation, helping ArcelorMittal on their mission towards a CO2-neutral future in steel production. We see this as the beginning of a prosperous long-term collaboration”, said the CEO of Vow ASA Henrik Badin.  ArcelorMittal Europe has committed to reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030 and has an ambition to be carbon-neutral by 2050. The company is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology routes as part of its strategy: Smart Carbon and innovative DRI. The Long Products business owns Europe’s only DRI-EAF facility in Hamburg, where a project is planned to test the ability of hydrogen to reduce iron ore and form DRI on an industrial scale, as well as testing carbon-free DRI in the EAF steelmaking process.

{"id":6540,"text":"Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal said:  “Despite the obvious challenges of 2020, ArcelorMittal starts 2021 in a position of comparative strength. Having achieved some key strategic targets, this seems like the right moment to transition to Executive Chairman and the Board unanimously agree that Aditya Mittal is the natural and right choice to be the company’s Chief Executive. We have worked closely together since he joined the company in 1997, indeed in recent years we have effectively been managing the company together. He has an unrivalled knowledge of the business and a keen sense of how the company must continue to transform to remain the world’s leading steel company. As Chief Executive, he will be taking on the effective day to day running of the company, but we will continue to work very closely together and I remain as fascinated, engaged and committed to the company’s long-term success as ever. I am looking forward to this next chapter.”  Aditya Mittal said:  “It is an honour to be appointed Chief Executive of ArcelorMittal. Mr Mittal built ArcelorMittal from a greenfield rolling mill in Indonesia to become the world’s leading steel company. It is an extraordinary achievement and I am privileged to have witnessed and been part of so much of that journey. I’m excited about what lies ahead. ArcelorMittal is full of incredible people, a company with excellent knowledge and capabilities and a company with tremendous potential.  “The world is transforming at a very rapid pace and this change brings challenges but also many opportunities for ArcelorMittal. The biggest challenge, but also the biggest opportunity, will be to demonstrate that steel can decarbonise and indeed is the perfect material for a circular economy. This will undoubtedly be a critical driver of our strategy in the coming years and decades. That Mr Mittal will remain very involved as Executive Chairman is a great advantage – his wisdom, knowledge and insight will be invaluable and I look forward to us continuing to work very closely together for many years to come.”  Bruno Lafont, Lead Independent Non-Executive Director, said:  “This is a well-planned transition and I would expect it be very smooth. Aditya Mittal is without a doubt the right candidate to be the next Chief Executive of ArcelorMittal. His knowledge and experience of the company is second-to-none and this step reflects the role he has increasingly performed in recent years. He has impressed the Board with his forensic knowledge of the business, his leadership skills in all market conditions and his knowledge of the sustainability trends that are shaping and changing the way the global economy operates. We are delighted that Lakshmi Mittal wants to remain fully involved. Over 45 years he created the world’s leading steel company from scratch and has arguably played a more influential role in driving progress in the industry than any other individual. With Mr Mittal as Executive Chairman and Aditya Mittal as Chief Executive, supported by strong segment and function leaders, ArcelorMittal is well positioned to succeed in the coming decade and beyond.”  As a result of these developments, Genuino Christino will become Chief Financial Officer. Mr Christino joined the company in 2003 and has held the position of Head of Finance since 2016.  BACKGROUND   Lakshmi Mittal founded what became ArcelorMittal in 1976 when he built a greenfield rolling mill in Indonesia. An early believer in the benefits consolidation could bring to the steel industry, he took his first international step in 1989 with the lease and subsequent acquisition of a steel company in Trinidad & Tobago. This was followed by expansion into Mexico, the USA, Germany, Kazakhstan and multiple eastern European countries. In 2004 Mr Mittal combined his two steel businesses, Ispat International and LNM Holdings to form Mittal Steel, while at the same time agreeing to merge with International Steel Group of the United States. This combination meant Mittal Steel became the world’s largest steel company, a position that was further reinforced in 2006 when Mittal Steel and Arcelor agreed to merge to create ArcelorMittal. Mr Mittal is widely recognized for his entrepreneurial and business success and has received numerous awards. He sits on the board of Goldman Sachs.  Aditya Mittal joined Ispat International in 1997 from Credit Suisse where he worked in the investment banking division. His first task was to oversee the IPO of Ispat International on the New York Stock Exchange. He subsequently became Head of M&A, leading the company’s expansion into Eastern Europe. As CFO of LNM Holdings he led the combination of Ispat International with LNM to form Mittal Steel, of which he became CFO. He identified the opportunity of combining Arcelor and Mittal Steel and led the merger offer which culminated in the creation of ArcelorMittal. As well as being CFO of ArcelorMittal he took up operational responsibilities, first as CEO ArcelorMittal Americas and then as CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe. He was named President in 2018.  Genuino Christino joined Cia. Belgo Mineira in Brazil (currently ArcelorMittal Brazil) in 2003 from KPMG where he worked as an external auditor and consultant for over 10 years in Brazil and in the UK. He was transferred to our head office in Luxembourg in 2009 and has progressively taken over additional responsibilities within finance becoming Head of Finance in 2016. He has been working closely with Aditya on developing and executing the Group's financial strategy.

{"id":6543,"text":"ArcelorMittal Asturias has completed its coke-oven gas injection project for Blast Furnace B in its Gijón plant, a strategic step to reduce CO2 emissions and operational costs, thanks to lower coke consumption.  ArcelorMittal Europe has a target to reduce its CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, and an ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050. To achieve this target, ArcelorMittal Europe has two main technological pathways, innovative DRI and Smart Carbon, which were presented in the company’s first Climate Action Report, published in June 2020. Innovative DRI involves the use of hydrogen for the direct reduction of iron ore (to produce direct reduced iron, DRI), for use in both electric arc furnaces and blast furnaces. Smart Carbon is a carbon-neutral steel production path that makes use of all clean energies (circular carbon, clean electricity and carbon capture and storage (CCS)) in a controlled high-temperature reduction environment for the production of hot metal. In the first stage, the Smart Carbon path will basically use circular carbon, expanding to become hydrogen Smart Carbon when green hydrogen is widely available and affordable.  The Smart Carbon approach, as applied in the projects that the Company is working on at its European Flat Products sites, allows gases from various sources to be injected into the blast furnace. The injection of coke-oven gas, with high hydrogen content, is an effective and cost-efficient method that enables steel producers to reduce CO2 emissions immediately. ArcelorMittal Asturias has completed the most advanced project in the Company, linked to the use of coke-oven gas, and has initiated the injection of grey hydrogen (hydrogen recovered from various gases, including natural gas and coke-oven gas) into Blast Furnace B.

{"id":6548,"text":"This partnership is the first step towards the creation of a new low-carbon hydrogen and CO2 capture technologies ecosystem in this major industrial basin.  Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal have signed an MoU that aims to contribute significantly to the decarbonization of the Dunkirk industrial basin. In the context of the Paris Agreement and the European Commission’s Green Deal, and in line with Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal’s commitments to energy transition, the project will reduce yearly CO2 emissions from ArcelorMittal’s steel-making facilities in Dunkirk by 2.85 Mt by 2030. Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal have jointly applied for large projects funding under the Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) scheme for hydrogen. Funding from European and\/or French schemes supporting decarbonization is key to the implementation of the project.  ArcelorMittal is ready to implement an innovative production unit on its Dunkirk site, combining two steel production technologies – DRI: direct reduced iron unit, and submerged arc furnace – in dimensions never seen before. As a low-carbon technology, the DRI and submerged arc furnace unit will enable the production of steel with lower CO2 emissions. This initiative was the subject of a preliminary study announced by ArcelorMittal last October. It comes in addition to the initiatives already implemented by ArcelorMittal on its Dunkirk site to lower its CO2 emissions.  Air Liquide will support this strategic initiative through the massive supply of low-carbon hydrogen and the implementation of CO2 capture technologies in Dunkirk, one of Air Liquide's historical industrial basins in France. The Air Liquide group has developed a unique expertise both for hydrogen all along the value chain, from production and storage to distribution, as well as CO2 capture technologies. Leveraging this know-how and in line with its Climate objectives, Air Liquide is committed to developing sustainable solutions supporting its customers in the steel industry to reduce carbon emissions.  This partnership between Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal is a first step towards the creation of an ecosystem at the forefront of low-carbon hydrogen and CO2 capture solutions that will be a source of competitiveness and attractiveness for various players in the Dunkirk industrial and port basin.  François Jackow, Executive Vice-President of Air Liquide and a member of the Executive Committee supervising Europe Industries activities, said:  \"Decarbonizing the Industry is at the heart of Air Liquide’s strategy and we are committed to accompanying our customers with a wide range of innovative solutions.

{"id":6549,"text":"ArcelorMittal today announces the launch of its first three XCarb™ initiatives, as part of the company’s journey to deliver on its 2050 net zero commitment.  XCarb™ will ultimately bring together all of ArcelorMittal’s reduced, low and zero-carbon products and steelmaking activities, as well as wider initiatives and green innovation projects, into a single effort focused on achieving demonstrable progress towards carbon neutral steel.  To support its launch, ArcelorMittal today announces three XCarb™ branded initiatives:    * Our ‘XCarb™ green steel certificates’, which will enable us to support our customers as they seek to reduce their Scope 3 emissions;   * ‘XCarb™ recycled and renewably produced’ pioneering products for customers;   * Our ‘XCarb™ innovation fund’.    Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Climate change is an overwhelming societal priority. At ArcelorMittal, we have an important role to play in helping society deliver the objectives of the Paris Agreement and are determined to lead our industry’s transition to carbon neutral steel.  “We have the scale, resources and technological prowess to make a significant impact, and have already identified the routes to carbon neutral steelmaking through our Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI pathways.  “Our launch of XCarb™ today brings the full breadth of our decarbonisation activity together under a single umbrella brand. It aims to demonstrate to stakeholders the diverse range of initiatives we are undertaking in pursuit of our 2050 net zero goal while also providing our customers with solutions which help them address their own carbon reduction targets, demonstrating the important role steel has to play in a future, circular economy.”   The first XCarb™ initiatives to be launched are as follows:  ‘XCarb™ green steel certificates’  Across our ArcelorMittal Europe - Flat Products operations, we are investing in a broad range of initiatives to reduce carbon emissions from the blast furnace. These initiatives range from our flagship Smart Carbon projects, such as Torero (transforming biomass into bio-coal to replace the use of coal in the blast furnace) and Carbalyst (capturing carbon-rich blast furnace waste gas and converting it into bio-ethanol, which can then be used to make low-carbon chemical products) to capturing hydrogen-rich waste gases from the steelmaking process and injecting them into the blast furnace to reduce coal use.  These effort-intensive investments result in considerable CO2 savings, which can be passed onto customers in the form of the steel industry’s first-ever certification scheme. CO2 savings are aggregated, independently assured, and then converted into XCarb™ green steel certificates using a conversion factor that represents the average CO2 intensity of integrated steelmaking in Europe. The scheme therefore provides customers with the opportunity to buy certificates attached to their physical orders of steel, enabling them to report a reduction in their Scope 3 carbon emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The company anticipates it will have 600,000 tonnes of equivalent green steel tonnes available by the end of 2022.  ‘XCarb™ recycled and renewably produced’  ‘XCarb™ recycled and renewably produced’ has been designed for products made via the Electric Arc Furnace (‘EAF’) route using scrap steel. Recycled and renewably produced means that the physical steel was made with recycled material (scrap) using renewable electricity, giving it an extremely low CO2 footprint that can be as low as approximately 300kg of CO2 per tonne of finished steel when the metallics are 100% scrap. This customer offer is for both flat and long products. The electricity used in the steelmaking process is independently verified, with a ‘Guarantee of Origin’ given that it is from renewable sources.  ‘XCarb™ innovation fund’  ArcelorMittal has launched an innovation fund which will invest up to $100 million annually in groundbreaking companies developing pioneering or breakthrough technologies that will accelerate the steel industry’s transition to carbon neutral steelmaking. To be eligible for funding, companies will have to be developing technologies which support ArcelorMittal on its journey to decarbonise. The technology also needs to be commercially scalable.

{"id":6551,"text":"Using green hydrogen, up to 3.5 million tonnes of steel could be produced by the Bremen and Eisenhuttenstadt sites by 2030, with significantly lower CO2 emissions. Depending on the amount of hydrogen available, CO2 savings of more than 5 million tonnes could be possible. The technology conversion requires investments in the range of €1-1.5 billion.  \"With our concept for the transformation of the plants in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, we are accelerating the implementation of carbon-neutral steel production. These projects have the potential to have a significant impact in reducing CO2 emissions, in line with the European Union’s climate commitments. We are now asking for the necessary support and access to funding, to make the implementation of our plans happen \" said Reiner Blaschek, CEO of ArcelorMittal Flachstahl Deutschland.  In Germany, the group already operates Europe’s only DRI-EAF plant in Hamburg, where the switch to using hydrogen instead of natural gas in the iron ore reduction process is being prepared. The objective is to reach industrial commercial maturity of the technology by 2025, initially producing 100,000 tonnes of sponge iron a year.  Background  To implement the projects, ArcelorMittal is planning to gradually adapt production in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt in order to be able to competitively manufacture carbon-neutral, high-quality steel using hydrogen in the iron ore reduction process.  This year, two blast furnaces – one in Bremen and one in Eisenhuttenstadt - will be converted to inject natural gas, reducing the use of coal in the iron ore reduction process and thereby further reducing CO2 emissions.  As a next step, innovative DRI-EAF plants are to be set up at both locations. In Bremen, ArcelorMittal initially plans to use natural gas for the DRI, and later hydrogen from electrolysis; the hydrogen is to be made available as part of the regional North German Clean Hydrogen Coastline network. The sponge iron produced in the Bremen DRI unit will initially supply the steelworks in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, until the regional hydrogen cluster in East Brandenburg can also supply the Eisenhüttenstadt site with sufficient hydrogen. In the transition phase, the additional hydrogen required in Eisenhüttenstadt will be generated from natural gas with the help of a pyrolysis plant that will be built on the steel plant’s premises. To secure the future supply of hydrogen, both sites are to be integrated into the European hydrogen network in the long term via the regional hydrogen networks.  ArcelorMittal has set itself the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 30 percent by 2030 in Europe and producing carbon-neutral steel by 2050. To this end, ArcelorMittal is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology routes, Smart Carbon and an innovative DRI-based route.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal plans major investment in German sites, to accelerate CO2 emissions reduction strategy and leverage the hydrogen grid  ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal is planning to build a large-scale industrial plant for the direct reduction of iron ore (DRI) and electric arc furnace (EAF)-based steelmaking at its site in Bremen, as well as an innovative DRI pilot plant in addition to an electric arc furnace (EAF) in Eisenhüttenstadt, following the announcement of the planned expansion of Germany’s hydrogen infrastructure.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-plans-major-investment-in-german-sites-to-accelerate-co2-emissions-reduction-strategy-and-leverage-the-hydrogen-grid\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The Hon’ble Prime Minister last Friday had requested suggestions for tackling the current COVID situation and since AM\/NS India produces oxygen gas in the Hazira facility we decided to build this hospital near the facility to help those in need. This will overcome the bottleneck in oxygen supply.”  ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel is primarily producing gaseous oxygen for steel production. However, it has ramped up the production of liquid oxygen substantially to 210 M\/T per day for medical use. As the Covid pandemic is becoming severe in the region, we are utilising the gaseous oxygen for medical purpose which otherwise cannot be transported.  Elaborating on the Covid Hospital, Dilip Oommen, CEO, AM\/NS India said, “We, at AM\/NS India, realise the need to support the authorities in the fight against the global pandemic. As part of our continued endeavour to serve the community, we have introduced the concept of bringing hospital to the vicinity of the oxygen plant, instead of transporting oxygen to hospital. Considering the speed at which the pandemic is spreading, we have also factored in the ramping up of the number of beds. We thank the Government of Gujarat for its cooperation and I reinforce all possible support from AM\/NS India in the fight against Covid-19.”   AM\/NS India is committed to standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the government, authorities, and medical personnel who are working relentlessly to safeguard people.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","title":"AM\/NS India sets up a 1000-bed COVID hospital with uninterrupted oxygen supply in Hazira","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"As the second wave of the Covid-19 virus swells, to supplement the government`s efforts, ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM\/NS India) – a joint venture between ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel – in alliance with the Government of Gujarat and District Administration, Surat, has set up a 250-bed COVID care hospital at Hazira, which will receive an uninterrupted supply of oxygen gas from its plant.

{"id":6556,"text":"The successful transaction reflects ArcelorMittal’s target of reducing its carbon intensity, and its belief that steel is the material of choice for the transition towards a low-carbon, circular economy.  Under the amended RCF – the largest ESG linked facility of its kind in the metals and mining sector - the margin payable will be increased or decreased depending on ArcelorMittal’s performance against certain metrics related to its environmental and sustainability performance. The metrics measured include the CO2 intensity of ArcelorMittal’s European operations and the number of ArcelorMittal facilities globally which have been certified by ResponsibleSteel™ by the end of each year.  ArcelorMittal has set a group-wide target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and a 30 per cent CO2 reduction target for its European operations by 2030. The Company has identified two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology routes, Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI. Its two flagship Smart Carbon initiatives, Carbalyst® (a carbon capture and reuse project) and Torero (converts waste wood into bio-coal which is used as a replacement for coal in the blast furnace) will both come on stream at the Company’s plant in Ghent, Belgium, next year, while in Hamburg, Germany it is developing an industrial-scale project to use hydrogen instead of natural gas in the direct reduction of iron ore.  The Company is a founding member of ResponsibleSteel™, the steel industry’s only global multi-stakeholder certification initiative. Its certification covers over 200 requirements addressing a range of environmental, social and governance standards. Several of the Company’s European Flat Products sites are currently undertaking the ResponsibleSteel™ site-level certification process.  In addition, it has been agreed that the leverage ratio financial covenant currently contained in the RCF will fall away in the event that ArcelorMittal obtains an investment grade long-term credit rating (with a stable outlook) from two rating agencies.  The RCF was signed on 18 December 2018 and remains undrawn and available for the Group’s general corporate purposes.

{"id":6558,"text":"The review, which can be accessed here, underpins the Company’s commitment to transparent reporting. It has been produced in-line with the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework, the Global Reporting Index Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016, the United Nations Global Compact, the European Union’s Directive 2014\/95\/EU on non-financial reporting and the Sustainability Accounting Standards.  The review provides an overview of the Company’s performance in 2020, outlines the progress it made against its strategic priorities and details its short- and long-term plans. Specifically, the review outlines ArcelorMittal’s performance and ambitions across the following areas: health and safety; delivering financial value; innovating smarter steels and solutions; and driving environmental and social sustainability. It also demonstrates the Company’s approach to ensuring it brings long-term, sustainable value to its broad stakeholder base.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “2020 was, by any measure, an extraordinary year. The Covid-19 global pandemic caused unprecedented disruption to societies, businesses and individuals across the globe, forcing us all to re-think the way we live and work. Our clear priority throughout the pandemic was to keep our employees safe and well. We are proud of the care they showed each other and their commitment to keeping the business running.  “Yet for all the challenges of 2020, it was also a year of progress for ArcelorMittal. We achieved our net debt target and improved the quality and earnings capability of our asset portfolio. The upshot is a higher growth portfolio as we are able to focus investment behind higher growth opportunities in markets like Brazil, Mexico, India and Liberia.  “I have therefore stepped into the CEO role at a time when the company is in many ways stronger, allowing me to focus on the four strategic pillars which underpin our vision to remain the world’s leading steel company in the coming decades. The first three – having a strong balance sheet, growth portfolio and competitive cost position – put the Company in a strong position to grow and develop.  “The fourth pillar of our strategy is our ambition to be a sector leader in sustainability. Global concern for sustainability and responsible business continued to grow in 2020, perhaps even accentuated by the challenge of the pandemic. We track performance according to five sustainable development themes but three issues in particular stand out – safety, decarbonisation and diversity. Despite considerable effort, we know our safety performance is not good enough. The Executive Office, the sustainability committee and the full board has discussed this in depth as a result of which changes have been introduced which we hope will support a step change in our safety performance.  “Although the transition to a low carbon society is a significant challenge, it also presents ArcelorMittal with tremendous opportunity. A significant milestone in our decarbonisation ambitions was the launch in March of XCarb™, a brand that brings together all of ArcelorMittal’s reduced, low- and zero-carbon steelmaking activities into a single effort, focused on achieving demonstrable progress towards carbon-neutral steel.   “It is widely recognised that diverse teams bring many benefits to organisations, including an increased wealth of perspectives and the capacity to make better-informed decisions. While our workforce is internationally diverse, our key issue has been gender diversity. We have worked on the plans to address it and are targeting doubling the number of female managers – or higher – by 2030.   “I hope we will be able to report progress on our key metrics in 2021. When it comes to sustainability, steel is an ideal material in the circular economy since it is easily recoverable and infinitely recyclable. I remain very confident in the future of steel, and in the ability of ArcelorMittal to succeed in this environment and continue to invent the smarter steels we need for a better world.”   Lakshmi Mittal, Executive Chairman, ArcelorMittal, added:  “Our vision is to remain the world’s leading steel company for many decades to come. We are aware that our ability to do so will be shaped not only by our financial performance but also our social and environmental performance, and particularly our ability to decarbonise. I have seen many fascinating and transformational developments in my decades in business. None, I believe, have quite the same implications as the challenge to decarbonise the global economy.  “It is a mammoth task for everyone and particularly for those of us operating in the so-called ‘hard to abate sectors’ which includes steel. We are acutely aware of the carbon footprint associated with steelmaking. Nevertheless, we remain confident that steel can and will remain the material of choice for building the world’s infrastructure. While we in no way underestimate the challenge of the transition, we are energised by the opportunities it will provide. Much of the infrastructure required for the transition to a low-carbon economy for example, including renewable energy systems and electric vehicles, depend on steel.  “The potential of the opportunity is what keeps us focused and energised. Our teams of engineers are working hard to ensure ArcelorMittal plays a leading role in the decarbonisation of our industry. Our financial strength, our innovative nature and the ingenuity and capability of our people to find solutions to the toughest challenges stands us in good stead to fulfil our purpose of inventing smarter steels for a better world.”  Key highlights discussed in the review include:    * Actions taken to protect the safety and wellbeing of our employees and support local communities during the pandemic. These included accessing essential medical supplies and personal protective equipment, using our global networks to facilitate the transfer of equipment to regions which are most in need, and financial donations to healthcare facilities, including laboratories to carry out Covid tests.   * The steps the Company is taking to improve its health and safety performance. Initiatives include enhanced governance, the re-vamping of the Company’s global Health and Safety Council and efforts aimed at instilling an interdependent safety culture group-wide.   * The Company’s strategy to address its carbon challenge and become a sector leader in sustainability, including the launch of XCarb™ in March and updates on the various decarbonisation projects being developed and deployed. In line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, in 2020 the Company announced a group-wide commitment to being carbon-neutral by 2050, and will shortly be announcing a group-wide CO2 emissions target for 2030.   * Progress the Company has made in reducing the carbon intensity of the steel it produces; CO2 per tonne of steel was 2.08 tonnes in 2020, a 1.4% improvement over 2019 and a 7.9% improvement since 2007, meeting the Company’s 2020 target.   * Insight into how the Company is managing its broader environmental impact, including detail on the $248 million allocated to 20 projects with energy and\/or carbon benefits, and the $396 million allocated to 32 projects which will deliver a broad range of environmental benefits.   * Progress towards meeting steel and mining certification and accreditation standards; following Covid-19 related delays, the Company has re-started the process of certifying its European flat products sites against ResponsibleSteel™ certification standards and committed to achieving Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) accreditation for its mines in Brazil, Canada, Liberia and Mexico by 2025.   * The importance the Company places on R&D, as evidenced by its $245 million R&D investment in 2020, which supported the launch of 29 new products and solutions to accelerate sustainable lifestyles and 27 to support sustainable construction, infrastructure and energy generation.   * Our plans to continue to improve on diversity and inclusion, including our target to double the representation of women in management positions to 25% by 2030.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes 2020 integrated annual review","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) has today published its 2020 integrated annual review, ‘Inventing smarter steels for a better world’.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-publishes-2020-integrated-annual-review\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6559,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces the completion of its first XCarb™ innovation fund investment since launching the initiative in March 2021. The Company has invested an initial $10 million in Heliogen, a renewable energy technology company which focuses on ‘unlocking the power of sunlight to replace fossil fuels’.  Heliogen’s technology will harness solar energy by using a field of mirrors which will act as a multi-acre magnifying glass to concentrate and capture sunlight. The sunlight will then be subsequently converted into heat (HelioHeat™), electricity (HelioPower™) or clean fuels (HelioFuel™).  All three Heliogen products have the potential to be applicable to the steelmaking process and support the steel industry’s transition to carbon-neutrality. HelioHeat™, for example, could be used to increase the temperature of air blown into a blast furnace, offsetting the use of fossil fuel. The Heliogen technology will also be capable of creating 100 per cent green hydrogen, which Heliogen is working to develop as its first HelioFuel™. Hydrogen sits at the heart of ArcelorMittal’s Innovative-DRI technology pathway, which involves using hydrogen instead of natural gas as the reductant in the production of direct reduced iron.  In addition to the $10 million investment, ArcelorMittal and Heliogen have signed a Memorandum of Understanding which aims to evaluate the potential of Heliogen’s products in several of ArcelorMittal’s steel plants.  Commenting, Pinakin Chaubal, Chief Technology Officer, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Developing and deploying breakthrough technologies is at the heart of our climate action strategy. While our own efforts are progressing well, the objective of our XCarb™ Innovation fund is to extend our reach and support companies developing technologies which could assist us on our decarbonisation journey. The technology Heliogen is developing has the potential to do exactly that.  “Moreover, the partnership we have established with Heliogen goes beyond investment. The MoU we have signed means we are actively exploring working with them to deploy their technologies in our steel plants, enhancing our ongoing programme of decarbonisation initiatives. Establishing partnerships of this kind has an important role to play in ensuring we succeed in our ambition to lead our industry’s efforts to decarbonise, and reach carbon-neutrality by 2050.”  Bill Gross, CEO and Founder, Heliogen, added:  “The future of our planet and civilization hinges on the global economy’s ability to shift from its reliance on fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. We founded Heliogen to eliminate the need for fossil fuels in all sectors of the economy and to empower a sustainable future. We’re thrilled to welcome ArcelorMittal as an investor in the company.”  “We’re also excited to begin working with ArcelorMittal to explore how our technology can support its significant decarbonization efforts. Heliogen’s Sunlight Refinery™, which will cost-effectively deliver 24\/7 carbon-free energy in the form of heat, electricity, or hydrogen fuels at scale for the first time in history, was designed for use by a spectrum of industries, including steel. Together, ArcelorMittal and Heliogen can meaningfully help the world achieve carbon neutrality.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal makes first investment through its XCarb™ innovation fund ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Initial $10 million investment part of broader partnership established with Heliogen","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-makes-first-investment-through-its-xcarb-innovation-fund\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6570,"text":"ArcelorMittal today announces that its Sestao plant in Spain will become the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant.  The development is the result of a memorandum of understanding signed today with the Government of Spain that will see an investment of €1 billion in the construction of a green hydrogen direct reduced iron (DRI) plant at its plant in Gijón, as well as a new hybrid electric arc furnace (EAF).  By 2025, the Sestao plant – which manufactures a range of flat steel products for the automotive and construction sectors, and general industry - will produce 1.6 million tonnes of zero carbon-emissions steel by:    1. Changing the metallic input by increasing the proportion of circular, recycled scrap, and using green hydrogen-produced DRI from Gijón in its two existing EAFs.   2. Powering all steelmaking assets (EAFs, rolling mill, finishing lines) with renewable electricity.   3. Introducing several key emerging technologies that will replace the small, remaining use of fossil fuel in the steelmaking process with carbon-neutral energy inputs, such as sustainable biomass or green hydrogen.    Central to this development will be the construction of a 2.3 million-tonne green hydrogen DRI unit in Gijón. Around 1 million tonnes of DRI will be transported to Sestao to be used a feedstock for its two EAFs.  The national and the Basque government’s support in this project is crucial, firstly from a funding perspective, given the significant cost associated with the transition to carbon-neutral steelmaking. Secondly, because it will enable ArcelorMittal to have access to green hydrogen supplied through a consortium of companies that will cooperate in the construction of the infrastructure required in order to produce hydrogen in the Iberian Peninsula using solar‑powered electrolysis and to transport it directly through a network of pipelines. The initiative involves the construction of multiple large-scale solar farms, with hydrogen produced in situ and with the corresponding impact in terms of employment.  In addition to the investments in the DRI and EAF installations in Gijón, ArcelorMittal will invest €50 million in Sestao. This will fund the introduction of key emerging technologies required to bring the plant to zero carbon-emissions, supporting 1.6 million tonnes of production.  Looking further ahead, the company has also committed to achieving net zero[2] at the Sestao plant as soon as possible.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:  “It is widely understood that for the world to achieve net-zero by 2050, faster progress over the next decade is essential. Having announced a net-zero target for 2050, we therefore set ourselves the challenge to identify how we could take an existing steel plant to zero carbon-emissions within the next five years. Our teams have been working incredibly hard to turn this ambition into the plan that we have announced today. This is a hugely significant development and demonstrates the strength of innovation embedded in our people, our unparalleled technology leadership, and what can be achieved through investment in existing steelmaking infrastructure. It means ArcelorMittal will be the first company in the world to be in a position to offer its customers meaningful volumes of zero carbon-emissions steel.  “The ability of the Sestao plant to become the world’s first zero carbon-emissions steel plant would not be possible without the support and partnership of the Spanish government.

{"id":6571,"text":"ArcelorMittal has today signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Spanish Government that will see a €1 billion investment in decarbonisation technologies at ArcelorMittal Asturias’ plant in Gijón. The investments will reduce CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal’s Spanish operations by up to 4.8 million tonnes, which represents approximately 50% of emissions, within the next five years[2].  The MoU states the commitment of ArcelorMittal and the Government of Spain to transition towards a decarbonised steel industry. ArcelorMittal will introduce new manufacturing processes that contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions. It will also further intensify its R&D capabilities in Spain to support the new project and innovation requirements. The Government of Spain will promote reforms and investments to support the development and growth of a strong, more competitive and sustainable industrial sector, as well as endeavouring to provide maximum financial support for the project, in line with Spanish legislation and European Union regulations.  Given the significant cost associated with the transition, in terms of both capex and opex, it is ArcelorMittal’s expectation this support will cover at least half of the additional cost to enable its operations to remain competitive as it accelerates its decarbonisation program.  The MoU was signed at an event in ArcelorMittal Asturias’ plant in Gijón, which was attended by ArcelorMittal Executive Chairman, Lakshmi Mittal, CEO Aditya Mittal and the President of Spain, Pedro Sánchez as well as Raül Blanco, the Secretary General for Industry, and Adrián Barbón, President of the Asturias regional government.  At the heart of the plan is a 2.3 million-tonne green hydrogen direct reduced iron (DRI) unit, complemented by a 1.1 million-tonne hybrid electric arc furnace (EAF). This starts the transition of the Gijón plant away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the DRI-EAF production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint. The new DRI - which will be the first of its kind in Spain - and EAF will be in production before the end of 2025.   To maximize the emissions reduction potential, ultimately green hydrogen will be used to reduce the iron ore in the DRI, with the EAF powered by renewable electricity. The support of the national and regional governments in this project is crucial as it will enable ArcelorMittal to have access to green hydrogen supplied through a consortium of companies that will cooperate in the construction of the infrastructure required in order to produce hydrogen in the Iberian Peninsula using solar‑powered electrolysis and to transport it directly through a network of pipelines. The initiative involves the construction of multiple large-scale solar farms, with hydrogen produced in situ and with the corresponding impact in terms of employment.  The Gijón DRI will also feed the company’s Sestao plant, situated approximately 250km from Gijón, where production is already entirely from the electric arc furnace route. This means that by 2025 ArcelorMittal Sestao will produce 1.6 million tonnes of steel and be the world’s first full-scale steel plant to achieve zero carbon-emissions.   Speaking at the signing of the MoU in Gijón, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:   “It is widely understood that for the world to achieve net-zero by 2050, faster progress over the next decade is essential. The MoU we have signed today will play an important role in doing exactly that. The construction of the new green hydrogen DRI plant in Gijón will not only enable us to reduce emissions from our Spanish operations by half but will also result in the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant in Sestao.  “Clearly, this is a project that will require the support of many different partners to succeed; our plan hinges on the supply of affordable, mass-scale hydrogen, access to sustainable finance and a supportive legal framework that allows us to be competitive globally. The Spanish government has clearly defined plans to transition the country to a decarbonised economy and I have been impressed by the progress made in creating the energy infrastructure that this green economy will require.  “As a large emitter, the steel industry can make a vital contribution to achieving net zero by 2050. This project demonstrates what is achievable.”  Expressing their support for the plan, Spain’s Minister of Industry María Reyes Maroto said:   “The Government of Spain and the ArcelorMittal Group fully agree that the transition towards a decarbonised economy is an essential objective for Spain, and they both recognise the industrial, technological and regulatory challenges that this transition poses for Spanish industry, as well as the opportunities it offers, in terms of innovation and improved competitiveness. The Government of Spain, through the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, will strongly support a new framework of institutional relations between the Government and the ArcelorMittal Group, because the Government of Spain recognises the importance of the steel industry for the development of the Spanish economy, while also recognising that the industry needs a stable and predictable legal framework as the best tool to enable it to be competitive and attain the targets set in terms of energy transition and digitalisation, both at national and at European Union level. In this regard, the Government of Spain is exploring regulatory instruments to support the industry in the transition process, such as the compensation programmes for electricity-intensive industries, tools to promote improved energy efficiency, public financing for digitalisation, instruments to promote industrial investments, training programmes and strategies to promote the use of clean fuels.”  ArcelorMittal Europe has a target to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, and an ambition to be net-zero by 2050. The company is pursuing two pathways to achieve this: Innovative DRI and Smart Carbon.  ArcelorMittal Spain’s operations are already contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions from the company’s steelmaking operations. Earlier this year, ArcelorMittal Asturias completed its project to capture hydrogen-rich coke oven gas and re-inject it into the blast furnace, replacing some of the coke used in the blast furnace. Deploying this innovative technology will result in a reduction in CO2 emissions of 125,000 tonnes a year, equivalent to the emissions generated by the annual consumption of 84,000 Spanish households with individual natural gas-based heating systems. These CO2 savings have already generated XCarb™ green steel certificates, which were launched by the company in March 2021, allowing ArcelorMittal customers to report a reduction in their Scope 3 CO2 emissions.  [1] On a Scope 1 and 2 basis.  [2] Should green hydrogen not be available at affordable rates by the end of 2025, natural gas would be used to power the DRI furnace. This would still result in a very significant reduction in CO2 emissions, of 4 million tonnes, approximately 45%.

{"id":6573,"text":"In the project CO2, which would otherwise have been emitted, will be separated and recovered from carbon-rich waste gas from the steelmaking process. An innovative chemical process, developed by SEKISUI CHEMICAL in Japan, then converts the waste CO2 into carbon monoxide rich Synthesis Gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen). The Synthesis Gas is then returned to the steelmaking process as an alternative reduction agent for iron ore, thereby lowering the volume of fossil resources required in the steelmaking process.  Key to this work is SEKISUI CHEMICAL’s innovative technology that converts CO2 to carbon monoxide at high yield. To date, producing carbon monoxide in large volumes from CO2 has been very challenging. SEKISUI CHEMICAL aims to demonstrate the ability to scale up its new technology through this partnership with ArcelorMittal.  The technology will initially be trialled over a three-year period at one of ArcelorMittal’s research and development laboratories located in Asturias, Spain, commencing in the third quarter of 2021. The investment cost of the project is USD1.9 million.  Pinakin Chaubal, Chief Technology Officer at ArcelorMittal, said:  “This is an exciting albeit early stage technology which complements our existing carbon capture and re-use or storage technology (CCUS) initiatives. Successfully decarbonising steelmaking will involve multiple technologies and we expect CCUS technologies to have an important role to play. This view is shared by the International Energy Agency which said in its recent ‘Net Zero by 2050’ report that CCUS technologies will be attached to over 50% of steel production by 2050.”  Katsunori Mukai, Director of Corporate R&D at SEKISUI CHEMICAL said:  “SEKISUI CHEMICAL has been developing basic technologies for sustainable societies. One of them is focussed on giving ‘LIFE to CO2’ by enabling carbon recycling in manufacturing industries. In this inter-industry partnership with ArcelorMittal, we are aiming to help reduce the carbon emissions of the steel industry.”  ArcelorMittal has a target of reducing CO2 emissions in Europe by 30 per cent by 2030 and producing carbon-neutral steel group-wide by 2050. To this end, ArcelorMittal is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology pathways, Smart Carbon and Innovative-DRI. Within its Smart Carbon pathway, ArcelorMittal is already developing and deploying other carbon capture and re-use technologies including Carbalyst, a €165 million project in Ghent, Belgium, which converts carbon-rich steelmaking waste gases into bio-ethanol, and IGAR, an industrial-scale pilot project in Dunkirk, France, to capture waste CO2 and waste hydrogen from the steelmaking process and convert it into synthetic gas to replace the use of fossil fuel in steelmaking.

{"id":6574,"text":"The company’s steelmaking sites in ArcelorMittal Belgium (Geel, Genk, Gent and Liège), Luxembourg (Belval, Differdange and Rodange) and Germany (Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt) are the first steel plants globally to be independently audited and found to meet the standards required for ResponsibleSteel, the industry’s first global multi-stakeholder standard and certification initiative.  The ResponsibleSteel audit process enables each site to prove that its production processes meet rigorously defined standards across a broad range of social, environmental and governance criteria including:     * Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions   * Water stewardship and biodiversity   * Human rights and labour rights   * Community relations and business integrity    The standard is based on 12 principles with a variety of criteria and underlying requirements. To be awarded with ResponsibleSteel certification, each site has to undergo a detailed third-party audit, with an independent Certification Committee making the final certification decision. ArcelorMittal worked with international auditor AFNOR and its German subsidiary GUTcert, both specialist companies providing certification and assessment services.  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe said:   “Responsible production techniques and high ethical and business standards have become increasingly important to our customers and consumers. ResponsibleSteel certification gives our customers the reassurance that we meet expectations on setting carbon reduction targets, as well as meeting expectations on environmental and social standards at every stage of production. The certification process has involved many teams across ArcelorMittal, and I would like to congratulate them for their hard work in being the first sites to achieve ResponsibleSteel™ certification – this is a major achievement.”  Explaining what the business has learned from the ResponsibleSteel certification process, Mr Van Poelvoorde said:  “In particular, the ResponsibleSteel process has helped us to improve our social management approach towards our rights holders, including our local communities, our employees, and the contractors working in our sites. While social sustainability has always been an important topic for us, ResponsibleSteel has taught us to take a more management systems-based approach to areas such as human rights, diversity and labour rights. As a result, our aim is to now manage social topics with the same systematic rigour with which quality, environment and safety topics are handled.”  He added: “Given the considerable investments we have already made to achieve a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 2050, as well as our broader environmental investments across our sites, I’m confident that we will achieve our goal of securing certification in each of our Flat Products sites early in 2022.”   ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products is also targeting ResponsibleSteel certification, at more of its sites during 2022.  Speaking at an event at ArcelorMittal Gent to mark the first certifications at ArcelorMittal sites, Anne-Claire Howard, ResponsibleSteel CEO said:   “I am delighted that the first steel sites which have been assessed against the very stringent set of criteria required in the ResponsibleSteel Standard have been approved. The ResponsibleSteel Standard was created by the steel sector’s only truly global multi-stakeholder initiative – designed to ensure business and consumers can be confident that the steel they use has been sourced and produced responsibly at every stage.“  She added: “I would like to congratulate the teams at ArcelorMittal who have supported the development and now the implementation of the ResponsibleSteel Standard at these first sites in Europe. This is truly a ground-breaking moment for both ResponsibleSteel and the steel sector. I am excited to work with the growing number of ResponsibleSteel members and am confident that the pipeline of steel sites who are working to achieve certification will continue to grow over the coming months. This will send a clear and strong message to markets, finance and governments that the steel industry’s intent to not only decarbonise steel production but also to ensure responsible ESG practices in steelmaking has very much begun.”  After the initial phase in Europe, further ArcelorMittal sites around the world will be part of the programme.  In 2021, ResponsibleSteel will launch a standard for the certification of steel products, which will include stringent requirements for raw materials supply chain. ArcelorMittal will continue to play an active role in developing this aspect of the programme.   Steel is the world’s most widely used material and those who use it in the transport, automotive, infrastructure, packaging, construction, energy and white goods sectors have a growing expectation that the materials they work with are responsibly sourced and produced. ResponsibleSteel, which is the world’s first’s responsible sourcing certification scheme for steel, aims to meet these expectations.  ### Discover more  The world’s first ResponsibleSteel-certified steel sites – a case study from ArcelorMittal Belgium  To read the public summaries of the audit reports for each site, please visit https:\/\/www.responsiblesteel.org\/certification\/issued-certificates\/","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal celebrates industry-first with ResponsibleSteel™ site certifications","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announces that it has achieved ResponsibleSteel™ site certification in Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-celebrates-industry-first-with-responsiblesteel-site-certifications\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6577,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) has today published its second group climate action report, following the first group report published in May 2019 and the European climate action report published in May 2020.  In the new report, ArcelorMittal has for the first time announced a 2030 global carbon emissions intensity reduction target of 25%. It has also increased its European 2030 carbon emissions intensity reduction target to 35% from 30% previously announced. All targets are on a scope 1 and 2 basis. The Company had previously announced a net zero by 2050 ambition in September 2020.  The Company’s targets are underpinned by a set of assumptions:    * The cost of green hydrogen will become increasingly competitive over the next decade but will still require government support.   * Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) infrastructure will take time to be built at scale. While Europe is expected to take the lead, CCUS infrastructure has the potential to expand quickly in the US and Canada – providing some potential upside to our assumptions.   * Different regions of the world will continue to move at very different paces and the level of climate ambition will differ between jurisdictions at any given time.   * The introduction of climate-friendly policies in other regions will be 5–10 years behind Europe.    Reflecting these assumptions, each region in which the Company operates is designated as either ‘Accelerate’ (supported by the introduction of more ambitious climate change policy) or ‘Move’ (reflecting a policy environment not yet providing any meaningful support to accelerate steel industry decarbonization and where accelerating without supportive policy will render the asset uncompetitive versus national\/regional competition).  2030 target breakdown and capex  The new climate action report provides a roadmap that illustrates the Company’s current thinking on the journey to net zero steelmaking. Five key levers are identified as the stepping-stones to achieve net zero by 2050. These are:  A – Steelmaking transformation: In the course of the coming decades the steel industry will undergo a transformation of the assets used to make steel on a scale not seen for over 100 years. This includes in a first phase the transition from coal (in the blast furnace) to natural gas (in a DRI plant) as a precursor to green hydrogen DRI.  B – Energy transformation: The energy used to make steel in future years will undergo a further and more radical transition, from high-emitting fossil fuel-based energy to low and zero-carbon emissions forms of energy. This includes green hydrogen, circular forms of carbon and CCUS technologies.  C – Increased use of scrap: As well as using scrap in the EAF, we will increase the use of scrap in blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) steelmaking.  D – Sourcing clean electricity: We will focus on increasing the amount of low and zero-carbon emissions electricity we consume. We plan to do this by purchasing renewable energy certificates and by direct power purchase agreements (PPA) with suppliers from renewable projects.  E – Offsetting residual emissions: There are likely to remain residual emissions for which either there is no feasible technological solution or the solution involves excessively high economic or social costs. For these emissions ArcelorMittal will buy high-quality offsets or launch projects to generate high-quality carbon credits.   Further specific detail for the 2030 target is provided aligning with these five levers, as follows:  1-  |   Announced projects Innovative DRI-EAF  |   -7.5%  |   A, C      ---|---|---|---      2-  |   Announced projects Smart Carbon and gas injection  |   -1.6%   |   B      3-  |   Further projects in development in Europe   |   -5.1%   |   A, B, C      4-  |   Project in NAFTA to be announced  |   -1.5%   |   A, B, C      4-  |   Further projects in development ex-Europe  |   -7.4%   |   A, B, C      5-  |   Sourcing clean electricity  |   -2.1%  |   D      To achieve this reduction the Company has estimated it will require a gross investment of c. $10 billion of capital expenditure. The Company expects to deploy approximately 35% of this c. $10 billion investment by 2025 with the remainder in the second part of this decade.  Over time, and with the deployment of appropriate technologies, it is expected that low-carbon steel-making technologies will become more competitive than higher-carbon steel-making technologies. However, this is not the case today and therefore companies will need support through well-designed policy to help moderate the initial capital costs, which will not yield a reasonable EBITDA return in the short-to-medium term, as well as the higher opex costs in the transition period that could otherwise render them uncompetitive. ArcelorMittal believes support of approximately 50% of total costs will be needed to enable companies to remain competitive regionally and globally through the transition period.   In terms of our investment decision-making, each major capex project proposal is required to demonstrate its CO2 impact to our Investment Allocation Committee (IAC). The IAC considers both the potential future carbon cost as well as the capital cost of decarbonization, to maximize our chances of achieving our targets while ensuring each project is economically justifiable and earns its cost of capital.  The announced Innovative DRI-EAF projects include:    * Reducing emissions in Spain by 50% by constructing a 2.3 million tonne hydrogen-powered DRI unit at Gijon, as well as a new hybrid EAF. The construction of these units will transition the Gijon plant away from BF-BOF steelmaking to DRI-EAF production.   * Transforming ArcelorMittal Sestao to be the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant by 2025. 1 million tonnes of DRI will be transported by rail from Gijon to Sestao to be used as feedstock for its two EAFs. Sestao will also change its metallic input; power all steelmaking assets with renewable electricity; introduce new emerging technologies that will replace the remaining use of fossil fuels in the steelmaking process with carbon-neutral energy inputs.   * Plans to build a large-scale industrial plant for DRI and EAF-based steelmaking in Bremen, as well as an innovative DRI plant and EAF in Eisenhuttenstadt. CO2 savings of up to more than 5 million tonnes could be possible depending on the availability of green hydrogen.   * The construction of a DRI plant in Dunkirk to produce 2 million tonnes per year of hot metal, reducing CO2 emissions by 2.85 million tonnes by 2030.   * Testing of hydrogen injection at our DRI facility in Quebec. The test will start with a limited injection of 5% within the energy mix and further phases are planned in the future. Renewable sources – specifically hydroelectric – provide 99% of Quebec’s energy.    The announced Smart Carbon projects include:    * Torero and Carbalyst – two technologies to enable the use of circular carbon, which does not add carbon to the biosphere. Torero is a torrefaction process to make steel-specific bioenergy from waste wood and waste plastic. Carbalyst allows us to use steelmaking waste gases to produce basic chemicals such as bio-ethanol, which are the key building blocks of plastics.   * In Gent, we are constructing an industrial-scale demonstration plant that converts waste wood into bio-coal through torrefaction. Two reactors will each produce 40,000 tonnes of bio-coal annually that can be used in the blast furnace as a substitute for coal. Reactor 1 is expected to start production in 2022 and reactor 2 in 2024.   * In Gent we are also constructing an industrial scale Steelanol demonstration plant to capture carbon off-gases from the blast furnace and convert them into bioethanol using microbes. The plant is expected to be completed in 2022 and will produce 80 million litres of bioethanol annually.    ArcelorMittal continues to believe that both technology pathways (Innovative DRI and Smart Carbon) have an important role to play in helping the steel industry, and the global economy, achieve net zero by 2050. Furthermore, the Company continues to develop a third route, direct electrolysis, which is still in the research and development phase. Which specific routes will ultimately be adopted is likely to differ from region to region and depend on policy choices and the availability of government funding. The Company has been able to accelerate plans for the world’s first zero carbon-emission steel plant in Spain for example because of government policy to accelerate the availability of green hydrogen.  Policy   The Company has also outlined in the report the combination of policy instruments it believes will be required to address not just the significant capital expenditure to transition to the new zero carbon-emissions technologies, but also the considerably higher operating costs associated with these technologies at least in the short-medium term until low and zero carbon-emission technologies become competitive. Policy instruments such as contracts for difference, used so effectively in enabling the renewable energy industry to become competitive, will play an important role in ensuring a level playing field during the transition period.  ArcelorMittal intends to actively and directly engage with policymakers and organisations that advocate for the policies and conditions that will enable steel to accelerate and achieve its net-zero transition globally while remaining competitive.  Science based targets  The Company has also announced a new collaboration with the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) and a commitment to publish a science-based target within the next two years. The collaboration will support the SBTi to develop a new science-based methodology for the steel sector.   As part of the Net Zero Steel Pathway Methodology Project (NZSPMP), ArcelorMittal has, with other steelmakers, been working on a set of principles by which it believes the steel industry’s alignment with a net zero by 2050 outcome should be measured. These principles were published on 27 July.   Just transition  ArcelorMittal is aware of key stakeholder concerns around a just transition. We are seeking to employ best practice principles to understand the social impact of our decarbonization strategy and support engagement with our key stakeholders and collaborate with policy makers in addressing this issue.  TCFD and Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Benchmark Alignment   The Company has followed the TCFD guidelines and the Climate Action 100 Net Zero benchmark. While we have not yet achieved full disclosure according to either the TCFD or CA100 Net Zero benchmark, we believe this report marks a meaningful step forward, thereby demonstrating to stakeholders our commitment to adopting a leadership position in the decarbonization of the steel industry in terms of target-setting, performance and disclosure.  Executive remuneration  The Company now intends to link these targets to executive remuneration. Details will be published in due course.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal said:  “As the world’s most prolific material, steel can make a huge contribution to the decarbonization of the global economy. Steel is already the material of choice due to its lower carbon footprint and high recyclability. But we can and must go further as zero carbon-emissions steel has the potential to be the backbone of the buildings, infrastructure, industry and machinery, and transport systems that will enable governments, customers and investors to meet their net-zero commitments.  “ArcelorMittal has been working hard to be at the forefront of our sector in the net-zero transition, as we believe not only will this help decarbonize the global economy but will also generate opportunities in multiple aspects of our business.   “This is reflected in the new targets we have announced today. We have for the first time published a group target for 2030, alongside a more ambitious target for our European business. These targets we believe are aligned with our net zero 2050 ambition and we have also announced today a new collaboration with the Science Based Target initiative.  “These targets reflect the uneven pace of change that is the reality of the world’s decarbonization journey. In regions of the world like Europe, where we are observing an ‘Accelerate’ policy scenario, we can be more ambitious – with plans to reduce emissions by 35% within the next decade. In other markets we face a situation where being a first mover will result in us being uncompetitive in that market. For our target setting today we assume progress in other regions of the world will be at least five years behind Europe.   “With COP26 focused on addressing the acceleration that is critical in the next decade if the world is to reach its 2050 target, it may be that we will see a swifter evolution of this policy environment than is currently envisaged. Policymaking has a catalytic role to play. ArcelorMittal intends to step up our advocacy for policies that support the acceleration of this transition, addressing the fact that both capex and opex costs will be significantly higher, at least in the short to medium term.   “Ultimately the goal is to ensure that the technologies that will decarbonize the steel-making process are competitive. The good news is that we already have two technology routes - Innovative DRI and Smart Carbon - which can enable the decarbonization of the industry with a third, direct electrolysis, looking encouraging. Given our global profile we believe it is sensible to continue to develop both these technology routes which essentially encompass the clean energy routes of both green hydrogen and also bio-energy with carbon capture utilization and storage.  “In Europe our strategy is largely focused on the Innovative DRI pathway. This reflects the commitment in Europe to prioritize the availability of green hydrogen at competitive prices. Spain’s plan to accelerate the availability of renewable energy and green hydrogen underpins our recent announcement that ArcelorMittal Sestao will become the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant.   “In many respects the challenges confronting steelmaking today resemble those faced by renewable energy over a decade ago. The importance of solar and wind was widely acknowledged yet the technology remained economically prohibitive. Targeted, reliable and thoughtful policies supported innovation and investment that enabled both companies and their financing partners to make long-term planning decisions.  “We are optimistic that the same will happen in steel. It is too critical a material on so many levels for that not to be the case. And as developing economies continue to grow, the world will need more steel, not less, to give a better quality of life to billions of people.  “Over this past year, we have engaged with our stakeholders on climate more than ever before. I hope this report demonstrates how seriously we take your input, how closely we have listened to your questions, and how committed we are to providing solutions.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes second group climate action report","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"- Targeting 25% global carbon-emissions reduction by 2030  - Estimated cost of c. $10 billion  - Europe 2030 target increased to 35%  - ArcelorMittal Sestao to become world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions plant - New collaboration announced with Science Based Targets initiative - Targets to be linked to executive remuneration","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-publishes-second-group-climate-action-report\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6579,"text":"ArcelorMittal (the ‘Company’) has today announced with the Government of Canada its intention for a CAD$1.765 billion investment in decarbonization technologies at ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton. The intended investments will reduce annual CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal’s Hamilton, Ontario operations by approximately 3 million tonnes, which represents approximately 60% of emissions, within the next seven years. This means the Hamilton plant will transition away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) – Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint.  ArcelorMittal will introduce new manufacturing processes that contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions and deliver other positive environmental impacts including the elimination of emissions and flaring from coke making and ironmaking operations.  The investment is contingent on support from the governments of Canada and Ontario. Today the Government of Canada announced it will invest CAD$400 million in the project. The Company is in discussions with the Government of Ontario regarding its support.  The announcement was made at an event in ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton, which was attended by ArcelorMittal CEO Aditya Mittal, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard, Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne and Minister of Labour Filomena Tassi.  At the heart of the plan is a 2 million tonne capacity DRI facility and an EAF facility capable of producing 2.4 million tonnes of high-quality steel through its existing secondary metallurgy and secondary casting facilities. Modification of the existing EAF facility and continuous casters will also be undertaken to align productivity, quality and energy capabilities between all assets in the new footprint.  The new DRI and EAF will be in production before the end of 2028.  This project contributes to the sustainability of well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing and is also expected to support as many as 2,500 jobs during the engineering and construction phases. It will also support ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s customers decarbonization ambitions while further enhancing ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s capability to support the most demanding product segments including automotive exposed, advanced high strength steels, and consumer packing.  This new production route for ArcelorMittal Dofasco will provide a technically advanced manufacturing environment for operations, maintenance, and technology staff to work in, with improved health and safety. New positions, training, and development will be provided for employees moving from existing business units to new assets, with approximately 160,000 training hours required to transition our workforce to the new footprint.  Expressing Canada’s support for the plan, Deputy and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland said:  “Our government has been steadfast in defending and championing our steel workers. Today’s announcement, through the Net Zero Accelerator, is about investing in the low-carbon transformation of Canadian industry, taking serious action in the global fight against climate change, and supporting good middle-class jobs in Hamilton. We will continue to be there to support growth and a strong economic future for our steel workers and the broader Hamilton community.”  François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, said:  “We are supporting our steel workers and companies like ArcelorMittal Dofasco as they seize today’s opportunities in the low-carbon economy and they do their part in the fight against climate change. This investment will ensure that Canada’s largest producer of flat-rolled steel adopts innovative technologies, continues to provide economic opportunities for Canadian workers, and contributes meaningfully toward our climate targets. This investment will create good jobs in communities like Hamilton and clean Canadian-made products for the world for decades to come.”  Filomena Tassi, Minister of Labour, added:  “This $400 million investment by our government in reducing greenhouse gas emissions at ArcelorMittal Dofasco will transform Hamilton. It will position ArcelorMittal Dofasco to become a world leader in the development of advanced steels and make a significant contribution to achieving Canada’s carbon pollution reduction targets. We are proud to work with organizations like ArcelorMittal Dofasco that are committed to building a stronger, more competitive economy by innovating to fight climate change and creating 2,500 new jobs.”  Speaking at the announcement in Hamilton, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:  “The plans we have announced today represent a historic moment for ArcelorMittal in Canada and North America, marking the beginning of a new era of steelmaking in Hamilton, that will result in a 60% drop in CO2 emissions within the next seven years. We are very pleased to be in partnership with the Government of Canada - as partners, we all recognize that it is vital to accelerate our carbon emissions reduction and strengthen our climate action. Indeed progress in the next decade is vital if the world is to reach net zero by 2050.  “This project is part of ArcelorMittal’s new global 25% CO2 2030 emissions reduction target which was announced yesterday in our second climate action report. DRI-EAF technology, such as that being introduced in Dofasco, is at the heart of our new target although we do also continue to develop our smart carbon technology route. Transitioning from the blast furnace route to the DRI-route, offers an immediate significant reduction in emissions in the first phase through natural gas and then in a second phase, which we call innovative DRI, harnessing green hydrogen or other Smart Carbon technologies.  “This is the first significant decarbonization project we have announced outside Europe and again reflects ArcelorMittal’s determination to lead the decarbonization of the steel industry. Across the company our people are highly motivated to demonstrate that steel can reach net zero and will be the core material for a carbon-neutral world. This project in Dofasco is a very significant and important milestone in this journey.”  Highlighting the transformative impact of the announcement, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard said:  “The Government of Canada’s investment accelerates the realization of low carbon steelmaking in Canada. This significant total investment in Hamilton will transform our organization and deliver exceptional benefits to all our stakeholders including our customers, our employees and the community.  “The new steelmaking footprint will improve our capability to support the most demanding product segments with advanced high strength steels, including those used for the emerging electric vehicles in the automotive sector. The new steelmaking stream also sustains well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing in Ontario, with the opportunity for our highly skilled employees to work in the most technically advanced Steelmaking assets in North America. The company’s bayfront property has been re-imagined and we are well on the way to a significant and broad reduction in environmental impacts, contributing to the health and sustainability of our community, the environment and the economy.”  ArcelorMittal has an ambition to be net zero by 2050. Yesterday the Company published its second group Climate Action Report in which it set a new 2030 global carbon emissions intensity reduction target of 25%. It has also increased its European 2030 carbon emissions intensity target to 35%, from 30%. ArcelorMittal estimates the cost of achieving its global 2030 carbon reduction target is c. US$10 billion and believes government funding support of approximately 50% is required to enable the Company to remain competitive regionally and globally through the transition period given the capital investment required and higher operating costs of low-carbon steelmaking technologies. The Company has developed two technology pathways, Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI, both of which it believes will have an important role to play in helping the Company achieve net zero by 2050.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal and the Government of Canada announce investment of CAD$1.765 billion in decarbonisation technologies in Canada","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"New DRI and EAF installations at ArcelorMittal Dofasco in Hamilton, Ontario will reduce carbon emissions by approximately 60%","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-and-the-government-of-canada-announce-investment-of-cad-1-765-billion-in-decarbonization-technologies-in-canada\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6583,"text":"This demonstrator plant, which will use hydrogen exclusively as the chemical agent to reduce iron ore into DRI, is intended to lay the foundation for a steelmaking process that means steel can be produced with zero carbon-emissions[1], using electric arc furnaces fed with hydrogen reduced DRI and scrap metal, powered by renewable electricity.   The Federal Government has expressed its intention to provide €55 million of funding support towards the construction of the plant, which is half of the €110 million total capital expenditure required. The next step is for the European Commission to approve the Federal Government's intention to provide funding before the installation of the new plant can begin. Production is scheduled to start in 2025.  DRI is currently produced using natural gas to reduce iron ore. In a transition phase, the process of reducing iron ore with hydrogen will first be demonstrated using hydrogen generated by the separation of waste gas from the Hamburg plant. Once available in sufficient volumes and at an affordable price, green hydrogen - made from the electrolysis of water using renewable energy - will be used. By 2030, ArcelorMittal plans to produce more than one million tonnes of zero carbon-emissions steel a year in the Hamburg plant alone, thereby saving around 800,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.  The plant is an important component of ArcelorMittal Germany’s Steel4Future strategy, which involves the conversion of its four German plants - in Hamburg, Bremen, Duisburg and Eisenhüttenstadt - to zero carbon-emissions steel production in the coming years.  Commenting, Dr. Uwe Braun, CEO ArcelorMittal Hamburg, said:  “With the intended plant, for the first time we will be able to produce 100,000 tonnes of DRI for steel production using hydrogen - as early as 2025. Our project thus contributes to the goal of greenhouse gas reduction and a low-carbon economy. The technology is also directly transferrable and shows how other steelworks in our group – like Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt - can convert to zero carbon-emissions steel production processes. But one thing is clear - the production of low or zero carbon-emissions steel is significantly more expensive than traditional steelmaking methods. When it comes to these challenges, we continue to rely on political support to create the appropriate framework conditions. The German Government's intention to provide funding helps our project and we are very grateful for this. Now we need approval from the European Commission so that words can be followed up with action.”  Svenja Schulze, German Federal Environment Minister, said:  “Ever since mankind started producing steel, it has needed coal to do so. We are helping to ensure that this will be possible in the future with hydrogen from wind and solar power. The restructuring of the steel industry is a huge challenge. The German Government will not leave the steel industry alone in the transformation. My ministry is offering concrete support for investment in climate protection through the decarbonisation funding program. For industry, our ambitious climate targets are both a challenge and an opportunity. If companies invest now in greenhouse gas-neutral processes and products such as green steel, they will be able to survive on the market in the future, and jobs will be secure. The prerequisite for all this is the expansion of renewable energies. Anyone who says yes to steel production with a future must also say yes to the spirited expansion of wind and solar energy.”  Jens Kerstan, Senator for the Environment, Climate, Energy and Agriculture in Hamburg, said:  “Those who pursue climate protection invest in the future, invest in the location and secure jobs. By switching to low-CO2 and, in the long term, climate-neutral steel production, ArcelorMittal is seizing the opportunity to become a pioneer of an innovative climate protection technology. The production of green steel is a particular challenge, and as an environmental authority we have closely supported the H2H project from the outset. I am pleased that with this project Hamburg is further expanding its pioneering role in the decarbonisation of industry. We need such innovative strategies to achieve our climate targets.\"  Michael Westhagemann, Senator for Economics and Innovation in Hamburg, said:  “Decarbonising industry, especially the steel industry, is a socio-political task of the century. The aim is to achieve our climate protection targets within the set deadlines without jeopardizing Germany as an industrial and technology location. Thanks to the commitment of the German Environment Ministry, here in Hamburg we are a good step closer to achieving this goal. Our heartfelt thanks therefore goes to the Federal Environment Minister and her office for their far-sighted support.”   Press contact: Arne Langner, [email protected], +49 30 75445-556  [1] On a Scope 1 and 2 basis.

{"id":6584,"text":"With the MDA amendment coming into effect, the ArcelorMittal Liberia will significantly ramp up production of premium iron ore, generating significant new jobs and wider economic benefits for Liberia.  The expansion project - which encompasses processing, rail and port facilities - will be one of the largest mining projects in West Africa. The capital required to finalise the project is expected to be approximately $0.8 billion, as it is effectively a brownfield expansion.  The expansion project includes the construction of a new concentration plant and the substantial expansion of mining operations, with the first concentrate expected in late 2023, ramping up to 15 million tonnes per annum (‘mtpa’). Under the agreement the company will have reservation for expansion for at least up to 30mt. Other users may be allowed to invest for additional rail capacity.  Economic benefits  As the largest foreign investor in Liberia, ArcelorMittal Liberia has invested over $1.7 billion in the country over the past 15 years.  More than 2000 jobs are expected to be created during the construction phase, with Liberians envisaged to fill the majority of the roles created.  ArcelorMittal operates a Vocational Training Centre and provides two-year residential certificate training in mechanical and electrical trades.  As part of the expansion, ArcelorMittal Liberia has also launched a training and development program for high potential Liberian employees who will gain on the job experience and knowledge in ArcelorMittal Mining operations globally.  The employees will receive advanced training in the fields of mining production and operation optimisation, plant maintenance, planning and execution, plant electrical operation systems, and electrical maintenance. Other training areas include plant fitting and heavy-duty mobile equipment maintenance, as well as mine production and operations.  The investment in advanced skills training demonstrates ArcelorMittal Liberia’s commitment to providing employment and professional development opportunities to Liberians.  In addition, it is envisaged that the expansion will further boost the growth of small and medium sized businesses in Liberia which offer a range of services to ArcelorMittal Liberia.  Commenting on the agreement, his Excellency George Manneh Weah, President of the Republic of Liberia, said:  “We are delighted to have reached this important agreement with ArcelorMittal Liberia, our long-term partner in the development of the mining sector in Liberia. This agreement demonstrates to the world that Liberia welcomes foreign direct investment and is a key emerging destination for capital. It further supports the Government’s ’Pro Poor’ agenda, which is underpinned by the importance of creating jobs to lift Liberian citizens out of poverty. The further investment by ArcelorMittal in Liberia bears testament to the company’s confidence in the future of this country. We are confident that our constructive working relationship will go from strength to strength.”  Lakshmi Mittal, Executive Chairman, ArcelorMittal, said:  “The expansion underlines ArcelorMittal’s long-term commitment to Liberia and the importance of a continued productive partnership with the government which helped bring this project to fruition. I would like to thank President Weah and his administration for their invaluable commitment and support which has been critical in enabling us to sign today’s agreement.  “The expansion of mine, processing, rail and port facilities is the largest iron ore project in West Africa and will draw international attention to Liberia as an attractive country to invest in. The current planned expansion is part of a long-term commitment by ArcelorMittal to Liberia that includes undertaking planning for the further expansion of our iron ore asset to at least 30mtpa.”  Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, added:  “This project is an important component of our strategic growth programme, designed to ensure ArcelorMittal captures the best organic growth opportunities within our business. The Phase 2 expansion in Liberia is an excellent example of how we can leverage growth opportunities within our existing asset base to deliver sustainable, long-term value.

{"id":6585,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces it has become an anchor partner in Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst program, committing to an equity investment of $100 million over the next five years.  Founded by Bill Gates, Breakthrough Energy is committed to scaling the technologies the world needs to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Breakthrough Energy’s efforts include investment vehicles, philanthropic programs, policy advocacy, and other initiatives, including Catalyst.  Catalyst, launched earlier this year, is a new model for how companies, governments, and private philanthropy can finance, produce, and ensure widespread adoption of next-generation clean technologies. The program will initially focus on four decarbonisation technologies: direct air capture (DAC); green hydrogen; long-duration energy storage (LDS); and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).  ArcelorMittal’s investment will be made through its XCarb™ innovation fund which was launched earlier this year. The Company anticipates investing up to $100 million annually through the fund in companies developing technologies with the potential to support and accelerate the transition to zero-carbon emissions steelmaking. To date, ArcelorMittal has invested $10 million in Heliogen, a renewable energy company which focuses on unlocking the power of sunlight to replace fossil fuels, and $25 million in Form Energy, which is working on the development of its breakthrough energy storage technology.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal said:  “The Catalyst program is innovative and necessary. It brings together public and private finance with the objective of fast-tracking the deployment of projects which can deliver significant carbon reduction. For ArcelorMittal and the steel industry this kind of initiative is critically important. The steel industry knows how to decarbonise – essentially what is missing is the availability of clean energy at competitive prices that provides the foundation for us to really accelerate. That’s why, after discussing the purpose of Catalyst with Bill, we were very happy to join as an anchor partner. Achieving net zero by 2050 needs a coordinated global drive the likes of which the world has never seen before. ArcelorMittal has its own comprehensive plan to decarbonise – with the first step being to achieve our group target of reducing emissions intensity by 25% by 2030 – but partnerships to scale up and accelerate progress are vital. There are so many interesting new companies and technologies that will help the world decarbonise – through both our XCarb™ fund and now Breakthrough Energy Catalyst we look forward to helping these companies accelerate their contribution.”  Bill Gates, Founder, Breakthrough Energy added:  “Avoiding a climate disaster will require a new industrial revolution. We need to make the technologies and products that don’t cause emissions as cheap as those that do, so the whole world can afford them and reach our climate goals. Through Catalyst, leaders from across the private and public sectors are coming together to focus on supporting technologies that are vital to the world reaching net-zero emissions but are currently too expensive to be adopted at scale. By coordinating investments and directing them toward these critical technologies, we can reduce their Green Premiums and help them get to market faster, so we can all reach our climate goals.”  ArcelorMittal recently published its second group climate action report in which it announced a 2030 global CO2e intensity reduction target of 25% and increased its European 2030 CO2e intensity reduction target to 35%. The Company had previously, in September 2020, announced its ambition to reach net zero by 2050. The report outlined the five key levers – steelmaking transformation, energy transformation, increased use of scrap, sourcing clean electricity and offsetting residual emissions – identified as the stepping stones to achieving net zero by 2050. It also detailed several of the projects the Company is undertaking to reach its 2030 reduction target. These include plans to create the world’s first zero carbon emissions steel plant in Sestao, Spain and convert its Canadian flat steel operations to DRI-EAF steelmaking through a CAD$1.8 billion investment which will reduce CO2 emissions by 60%.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal joins Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst program as anchor partner","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"$100 million equity investment to be made over five years through XCarb™ innovation fund","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-joins-breakthrough-energy-s-catalyst-program-as-anchor-partner\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6588,"text":"ArcelorMittal announces that it has signed a letter of intent with the Governments of Belgium and Flanders, supporting a €1.1 billion project to build a 2.5 million-tonne direct reduced iron (DRI) plant at its site in Gent, as well as two new electric furnaces.  A DRI plant uses natural gas, and potentially hydrogen, instead of coal to reduce iron ore, resulting in a large reduction in CO2 emissions compared with blast furnace ironmaking. The two electric furnaces will melt the DRI and scrap steel, which will then be transformed in the steel shop into steel slabs and then further processed into finished products.  Once the DRI and electric furnaces are built, there will be a transition period during which production will move gradually from blast furnace A, to the DRI and electric furnaces, after which blast furnace A will be closed as it reaches the end of its life. By 2030, this will result in a reduction of around three million tonnes of CO2 emissions each year.  The support of both the national and the Flanders governments in this project is crucial given the significant cost associated with the transition to carbon-neutral steelmaking.  Approval from the European Commission for the funding support will also be required.  Smart Carbon and DRI synergies   The DRI plant will operate alongside Gent’s blast furnace B, which restarted production in March 2021 following a significant investment of €195 million.  Various decarbonisation initiatives, including the commissioning in 2022 of Gent’s Steelanol\/Carbalyst and Torero projects will see annual CO2 emissions reduction of 0.9 million tonnes by 2030.  The combination of the new DRI plant alongside a sustainable, state-of-the-art blast furnace enables the creation of unique synergies in ArcelorMittal Belgium’s roadmap to climate-neutral steelmaking.  Combined, the various initiatives will enable ArcelorMittal Belgium to reduce its CO2 emissions by 3.9 million tonnes per year by 2030 (on a scope 1 and 2 basis, compared with 2018), which is equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 848,172 cars being driven for a year[1]. As a result, ArcelorMittal Belgium will make a significant contribution to ArcelorMittal Europe’s ambition to reduce CO2e emissions intensity by 35% by 2030 and to become carbon neutral by 2050.  Roadmap to 2050  The hybrid model approach of Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI steelmaking in Gent fits into ArcelorMittal Belgium’s CO2 roadmap which consists of three axes:    * Further improvement of material and energy efficiency as well as increased scrap usage   * The implementation of Smart Carbon technologies:     1. Replacing fossil carbon with circular and waste carbon: 'Fresh' raw materials will increasingly be replaced with waste products, in an environmentally and economically feasible way. The Torero project will pre-treat waste wood from container parks to produce bio-coal suitable for the blast furnace process. ArcelorMittal Belgium also has demonstration projects running with plastic waste that could be injected into the blast furnaces in the form of powder or gas.   2. Reforming waste gas into useful chemical compounds: In 2022, ArcelorMittal Belgium will commission a plant (Steelanol\/Carbalyst) to biologically convert gas from the steelmaking process into bioethanol.   3. Separating CO2 for reuse or storage.     * Hydrogen: replacing carbon as a reductant, with hydrogen (ultimately green hydrogen, when it is available commercially).    Alexander De Croo, Prime Minister of Belgium, said:  “To tackle the climate crisis, we need ambitious action. European countries are leading the way, with clear targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. It is good to see that sectors with a large footprint are also joining the race by investing in innovation that reduces emissions and, in the long term, achieves carbon neutrality. This major investment in new technology by ArcelorMittal is important for the wider Ghent region, for reducing our country's footprint, and shows that decarbonising our economy is a joint effort.”  Jan Jambon, Flemish Minister-President, said:  “We believe that technological breakthroughs are key in delivering on the climate agenda. The ambitious roadmap brought forward by ArcelorMittal for its site in Ghent is in that sense an opportunity.”  Vincent Van Peteghem, Deputy Prime Minister of the Belgian Government and Belgian Minister of Finance, said:  “In order for us to enable climate transition for a better, healthier tomorrow it is crucial for government and industry to come together in this crucial pivoting point in time. ArcelorMittal is proving to be a leading example for this transition in our region. This joint effort is not only securing the presence of ArcelorMittal in our region but is also quintessential in lending the Ghent region healthy & clean air for all.”  Hilde Crevits, Deputy Prime Minister of the Flemish Government and Flemish Minister for Economy, Innovation, Work, Social Economy and Agriculture, said:  “ArcelorMittal has chosen a ground-breaking and innovative technology that will significantly reduce emissions from one of their blast furnaces, resulting in a 4% reduction of emissions in Flanders. This unique project will serve as an example to the rest of Europe on how to realise the goal of climate neutrality. Simultaneously, it ensures the sustainable creation of jobs and strengthens ArcelorMittal's competitiveness, to the benefit of Flanders’ welfare and prosperity.”  Tinne Van der Straeten, Belgian Minster of Energy, said:  “This ambitious project shows that industry is a crucial partner to achieve a climate neutral society by 2050. It will be one of the largest climate investments in Belgium that will anchor ArcelorMittal in the Ghent region, that guarantees employment and that will provide low carbon and ultimately carbon neutral steel. Green steels is needed in the switch to 100% renewable energy. What is good for the climate is good for the economy and for everyone.”  Matthias Diependaele, Flemish Minister of Finance and Budget, Housing and Immovable Heritage, said:  “This investment for ArcelorMittal's infrastructure is a sign of responsible Flemish policy. We are investing in a sustainable future for the country, both in terms of emissions and in securing employment in the port of Ghent.”  Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Today’s announcement is the third major decarbonisation project we have announced in the past two months, demonstrating how we are taking firm steps to decarbonise our operations and crucially, to accelerate progress in the decade ahead. None of these projects would be possible without government backing, so we are very grateful to the governments of Belgium and Flanders for their ongoing support as we transition to net-zero steelmaking. Today’s announcement of our project to build a 2.5 million-tonne DRI plant that will co-exist with and complement the Smart Carbon pathway in which we are already investing in Gent, is an example of the kind of transformational change we want and need to implement in order to accelerate ArcelorMittal’s journey to net-zero steelmaking.”  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO, ArcelorMittal Europe, said:   “ArcelorMittal Europe recently announced a more ambitious target for reducing CO2 emissions, from a 30% to a 35% decrease by 2030. We are able to reduce our environmental impact faster, thanks to projects such as this, which embody the cooperation and innovation that we need in order to succeed. ArcelorMittal Belgium has played a vital role in the European business’ decarbonisation strategy from the outset, and as a result of today’s announcement, we will continue to see it at the forefront as we move closer to net-zero steelmaking.”   Manfred Van Vlierberghe, CEO, ArcelorMittal Belgium, said:  “ArcelorMittal Belgium has a passion for sustainability and circularity. We continue to invest and launch new projects in order to remain at the forefront of energy and climate transition. This €1.1 billion project is a major milestone in our decarbonisation journey. The DRI plant and two electric furnaces will result in a sharp decrease of CO2 emissions while the relined blast furnace will contribute to recycling waste wood and end-of-life plastics. This approach contributes to strengthening our global leadership in terms of CO2 and energy efficiency in the steel sector.”  [1] Calculated using the US EPA greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator - https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/energy\/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal signs letter of intent with the governments of Belgium and Flanders, supporting €1.1 billion investment in decarbonisation technologies at its flagship Gent plant","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Belgium will reduce CO2 emissions by 3.9 million tonnes per year by 2030, by building a 2.5 million-tonne direct reduced iron (DRI) plant and two electric furnaces at its Gent site, to operate alongside its state-of-the-art blast furnace that is ready to take waste wood and plastics as a substitute for fossil carbon.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-signs-letter-of-intent-with-the-governments-of-belgium-and-flanders-supporting-1-1-billion-investment-in-decarbonisation-technologies-at-its-flagship-gent-plant\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6591,"text":"The floating solar farm has been installed on a former cooling pond belonging to ArcelorMittal Differdange, and consists of 25,000m2 of solar panels, with a surface area of 5.7 hectares. Eventually, the electricity produced will amount to 3 GWh\/year and will be able to power nearly 800 local homes, i.e. the annual electricity usage of 3,200 people*. The electricity produced on the floating solar farm will be fed into the local grid and contribute to Luxembourg’s energy self-sufficiency.  Genesis of the project   In 2019, as part of a call for projects launched by the Luxembourg government, for the production of electricity from solar energy, ArcelorMittal and Enovos decided to join forces to carry out the first project of its kind in the Grand Duchy. A contract was signed between the two partners, under the terms of which ArcelorMittal would make its Differdange industrial basin available to the energy operator, which owns, manages and operates the photovoltaic structure.  A first in Luxembourg   Following feasibility studies and the obtaining of the necessary administrative permits, construction started in March 2021 and the plant was commissioned on 21 October 2021. This unusual construction project involved around 30 people for more than six months. The floating solar structure and the transformer station were first installed, and then the electrical connection was made. The highlight of this phase of the project was the drilling under the rail network adjacent to the basin, which allowed the cables needed to connect the installation to the public network, to be laid.  Thomas Georges, CEO of ArcelorMittal Differdange, said: \"With this project, which is in line with ArcelorMittal's sustainable development strategy in Luxembourg, and in particular with our commitment to communities and citizens, we have made available the conversion of an industrial basin for sustainable energy production. The combined efforts of ArcelorMittal and Enovos have made it possible to develop an innovative solution for the benefit of Luxembourg households. This project is a first for our sites and serves as an inspiration for future projects, as part of our decarbonisation strategy.  For Enovos and the Encevo Group, the message is clear: \"Enovos is building on its growing expertise to develop and build large-scale green energy plants. We are working hard to develop new concepts that emphasise the value of space and allow for multiple use between biodiversity, industrial activities and energy production from renewable sources. The Differdange floating plant is a clear example of how, by joining forces with industry and the energy supplier, we can advance the energy transition. We are proud to have ArcelorMittal as a partner on our journey to carbon neutrality.  * based on a consumption per 4-person household of 3,668 KWh\/year.  # Click here to watch a film about the project:","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Differdange hosts Luxembourg’s first floating solar farm    ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"HRH Grand Duke Henri and Claude Turmes, Luxembourg’s Minister of Energy, attended today’s ceremony to celebrate Luxembourg’s first floating solar farm, which was officially inaugurated by Thomas Georges, CEO of ArcelorMittal Differdange, accompanied by Claude Seywert, CEO Encevo Group and Erik Von Scholz, CEO Enovos Luxembourg.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-differdange-hosts-luxembourg-s-first-floating-solar-farm\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":6593,"text":"The investment, in which the Quebec government will contribute through an electricity rebate of up to CAD$80 million, will enable the Port-Cartier plant to become one of the world’s largest producers of DRI pellets, the raw material feedstock for ironmaking in a DRI furnace. The project includes the implementation of a flotation system that will enable a significant reduction of silica in the iron ore pellets, facilitating the production of a very high-quality pellet.  The project will deliver a direct annual CO2e reduction of approximately 200,000 tonnes at AMMC’s Port-Cartier pellet plant, equivalent to over 20% of the pellet plant’s total annual CO2e emissions. This reduction in CO2e emissions will be achieved through a reduction in the energy required during the pelletising process.  A DRI plant uses natural gas to reduce iron ore, resulting in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions compared with coal-based blast furnace ironmaking. In Hamburg, Germany, ArcelorMittal is trialing replacing natural gas with hydrogen to make DRI, with its industrial scale pilot project anticipated to be commissioned before the end of 2025. The DRI installations the Company has announced it is developing in Belgium, Canada and Spain are all being constructed to be hydrogen-ready, so as and when green hydrogen is available in sufficient quantities at affordable prices the Company can produce DRI with near zero-carbon emissions.  Approximately 250 jobs are expected to be created during the construction phase of the project in Port-Cartier, which is scheduled to be begin mid-2023 and complete before the end of 2025.  Expressing the Quebec government’s support for the project, Premier François Legault said:  “With this project, the Port-Cartier plant will become one of the world's largest producers of direct reduction pellets. The market is increasingly evolving towards this technology. We are therefore ensuring that ArcelorMittal will continue to create wealth in Quebec for many years. We are positioning our regions at the heart of the green economy of tomorrow. My message to companies looking for a place to reduce their GHG emissions is come and see us. We'll help you carry out your projects promptly. Quebec is the best place in the world to invest in the green economy. To build together a greener, more prosperous and prouder Quebec.’’  Aditya Mittal, ArcelorMittal CEO, said:  “This project has an important role to play in our efforts to reduce our group’s CO2e emissions intensity by 25% by 2030, and our longer-term ambition to reach net zero by 2050. Not only does it deliver a significant reduction in our emissions at AMMC, but it also expands our ability to produce high-quality direct reduced iron pellets, which we will need in significant volumes as we transition to DRI-EAF steelmaking at our steel plants in Canada and Europe.  “I am grateful to Premier Legault and his government for the support it is providing in realising this project. It is the first significant decarbonisation project we have announced for our mining business and fitting that we are able to make this announcement at COP26 as it exemplifies the transformational change we need to deliver this decade as we move towards becoming a carbon-neutral business.”   Mapi Mobwano, CEO, ArcelorMittal Mining Canada, added:  “This investment will see us become one of the biggest direct reduction pellet producers in the world, thereby propelling ArcelorMittal Mining Canada into the forefront of mining and steel decarbonisation. From 2025 onwards we will have the capacity to produce ten million tonnes of very high-quality iron oxide pellets, with low silica content and high iron density, which will be highly strategic in the years ahead. This transformation will enable us to reduce our own current emissions by 200,000 tonnes of CO2e per year – equivalent to removing 57,600 cars from the road each year. Moreover, it will support a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of primary steelmaking. These pellets are the feedstock for DRI-EAF steelmaking, which given its significantly lower carbon footprint is expected to replace a significant amount of blast furnace capacity in the coming decades. It also provides a boost to the local economy and community as 250 jobs will be created for the construction phase which will start in the summer of 2023.”  [1] AMMC’s pellet plant currently produces 10 million tonnes of pellets annually, of which 7 million tonnes are blast furnace pellets and 3 million tonnes are direct reduced iron pellets","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal announces CAD$205 million decarbonisation investment in its flagship Canadian mining operations with support from the Quebec government","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"At an event held at COP26 today, ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) and the government of Quebec announced a CAD$205 million investment by ArcelorMittal Mining Canada (‘AMMC’) in its Port-Cartier pellet plant, enabling this facility to convert its entire [1] 10 million tonne annual pellet production to direct reduced iron (‘DRI’) pellets by the end of 2025.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-announces-cad-205-million-decarbonisation-investment-in-its-flagship-canadian-mining-operations-with-support-from-the-quebec-government\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6605,"text":"The Prime Minister announced support from the French Government for ArcelorMittal’s decarbonisation programme in France, which involves a €1.7 billion investment in its Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk sites in France. This investment will enable a profound transformation of steelmaking in France and a total reduction of close to 40% or 7.8 million tonnes per year in ArcelorMittal’s CO2 emissions in France by 2030. This transformation will represent a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing industry in France and put France’s steelmaking industry on the path of the Paris Agreement.  The transformation of steelmaking operations will generate positive and sustainable dynamics for employment and industrial activity in France, especially in the Dunkirk and Fos-sur-Mer areas.  ArcelorMittal will implement €1.7 billion of investments by 2030 to accelerate the decarbonisation of its steelmaking sites in Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk while maintaining equivalent production capacities:    * In Fos-sur-Mer, ArcelorMittal will build an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). This new unit will complement the ladle furnace announced last March and supported by France’s recovery plan, ‘France Relance’. Together these investments will turn Fos-sur-Mer into a reference site for the production of low carbon, circular steel, made from recycled steel;   * In Dunkirk, ArcelorMittal will build a 2.5 million tonne Direct Reduction of Iron (DRI) unit to transform iron ore using hydrogen instead of coal. This DRI will be coupled with an innovative technology electric furnace and completed by an additional Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). Other investments are already under way to continue to increase the proportion of scrap steel used.    The new industrial facilities will be operational starting in 2027 and will gradually replace 3 out of 5 of ArcelorMittal’s blast furnaces in France by 2030 (2 out of 3 in Dunkirk, 1 out of 2 in Fos).  Decarbonising the Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk sites will contribute to maintaining and developing the French steelmaking industry. It will also support the strengthening and development of local ecosystems, generating positive and sustainable dynamics for employment and industrial activity in France, especially in the Dunkirk and Fos-sur-Mer areas.  Commenting, Eric Niedziela, Chairman of ArcelorMittal France and Vice President Climate Action ArcelorMittal Europe, said:  “ArcelorMittal is honored that the French State supports our projects. We are proud to have this unique opportunity to contribute to the objectives of the France 2030 plan and to maintaining a strong manufacturing industry in France, serving European markets. ArcelorMittal’s management team and its 15,500 employees in France are mobilised to succeed in this new industrial revolution and we will be happy to welcome new talents willing to participate in this extraordinary adventure.”  Yves Koeberlé, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, added:  “As a leader in steelmaking, ArcelorMittal is committed to decarbonising its plants in Europe to serve our industrial customers – automotive, packaging, construction, transport but also solar and wind energy and future networks for hydrogen and CO2 capture. We are grateful for this support from the French State which will enable the major transformation of our sites in Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk which together account for over one-third of ArcelorMittal’s flat steel production in Europe.”  Matthieu Jehl, CEO of ArcelorMittal France, said:  “This support makes possible the extremely high investments we need to make to decarbonise steelmaking on our Dunkirk site, Europe’s largest steel producing site. We will therefore continue transforming our sites in France to deliver our customers with low carbon steel.”   Bruno Ribo, CEO of ArcelorMittal Méditerranée, said:  “Our Fos-sur-Mer site will undergo a first-of-a-kind transformation to decarbonize. Our teams are already implementing a first investment – our ladle furnace – which will increase our production of low carbon steel. We are ready to continue.”  ArcelorMittal’s French operations have already started working on a second step in their decarbonisation programme, which will use the technologies implemented during the first step, along with carbon capture and storage or utilisation (CCU\/S) technologies, assuming the technology sufficiently matures and regulation ensures it economic viability. This second step will enable ArcelorMittal’s French operations to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.  The partnership between ArcelorMittal and the French government for the projects is subject to EU approval, which is anticipated by the second quarter of this year, as well as the availability of economically viable energy infrastructure and supply.  Decarbonising ArcelorMittal’s operations in France: three ways to carbon neutrality  ArcelorMittal plays its part in the fight against climate change and has set ambitious objectives: a 35% reduction in CO2 emissions in Europe and a -25% reduction globally by 2030; and carbon neutrality by 2050.  To do this, ArcelorMittal will change completely the way it produces steel, by:  ✅ Increasing the recycling of steel: one kilo of steel produced by ArcelorMittal in France will soon contain up to 25% recycled steel  ✅ Developing innovative DRI, to make steel without coal, with hydrogen  ✅ Capturing residual CO2 for storage or usage (CCU\/S).","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2022-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal accelerates its decarbonisation with a €1.7 billion investment programme in France, supported by the French Government","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Visiting the ArcelorMittal site in Dunkirk, France, today, French Prime Minister Jean Castex, Minister of Ecological Transition Barbara Pompili, and Minister of Industry Agnès Pannier-Runacher were welcomed by Eric Niedziela, Chairman of ArcelorMittal France and Vice President Climate Action ArcelorMittal Europe, Matthieu Jehl, CEO of ArcelorMittal France, Bruno Ribo, CEO of ArcelorMittal Méditerranée, and Yves Koeberlé, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-accelerates-its-decarbonisation-with-a-1-7-billion-investment-programme-in-france-supported-by-the-french-government\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6608,"text":"ArcelorMittal (the ‘Company’) has today confirmed with the Government of Ontario its plan for a c. CAD$1.8 billion investment in decarbonisation technologies at ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton. As announced in July, 2021, the investment will reduce annual CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal’s Hamilton, Ontario operations by approximately 3 million tonnes, which represents approximately 60% of emissions. This means the Hamilton plant will transition away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) – Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint.  The project is scheduled to be complete by 2028, although the Company is looking for opportunities to accelerate the project timelines.  The new manufacturing processes contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions and deliver other positive environmental impacts including the elimination of emissions and flaring from coke making and ironmaking operations.  The investment was contingent on support from the governments of Canada and Ontario. In July 2021 the Government of Canada announced it will invest CAD$400 million in the project and today, the Government of Ontario announced it will invest CAD$500 million in the project. This secures project funding and firms up the investment.  Today’s announcement was made at an event in ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton, which was attended by ArcelorMittal North America CEO John Brett, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, Minister of Economic Development Job Creation and Trade Vic Fedeli, Minister of Energy Todd Smith and MPP Donna Skelly.  At the heart of the plan is a 2.5 million tonne capacity DRI facility and an EAF facility capable of producing 2.4 million tonnes of high-quality steel through its existing secondary metallurgy and secondary casting facilities. Modification of the existing EAF facility and continuous casters will also be undertaken to align productivity, quality and energy capabilities between all assets in the new footprint.  This project contributes to the sustainability of well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing and is also expected to support as many as 2,500 jobs during the engineering and construction phases. It will also support ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s customers decarbonisation ambitions while further enhancing ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s capability to support the most demanding product segments including automotive exposed, advanced high strength steels, and consumer packing.  This new production route for ArcelorMittal Dofasco will provide a technically advanced manufacturing environment for operations, maintenance, and technology staff to work in, with improved health and safety. New positions, training, and development will be provided for employees moving from existing business units to new assets, with approximately 160,000 training hours required to transition our workforce to the new footprint.  Announcing the investment, Vic Fedeli, Minster of Economic Development Job Creation and Trade said:  “From day one, our government’s plan has been to unleash Ontario’s economic potential by reducing the cost of doing business in Ontario by nearly $7 billion a year. This once-in-a-generation investment to transform the province into a world-leading producer of green steel is a major step forward as we strive for a full economic recovery and transform our auto supply chains to build the car of the future – right here in Ontario.”  Speaking at the announcement in Hamilton, John Brett, ArcelorMittal North America CEO, said:  “Reducing our CO2 emissions intensity worldwide by 25% by 2030 is an ambitious target for a steel and mining company; but we believe it is achievable and that it is our responsibility to invent or innovate the processes and technologies that will enable us to reach that goal. As part of that, we understand that in the coming years, the assets used to make steel will undergo a transformation on a scale not seen for many decades.”  Highlighting the impact of the announcement, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard said:  “This is the most significant construction project ever undertaken at Dofasco. And the most important achievement in the project timeline will be that everyone working on site is working safely and returning home to their family unharmed.  “All options for the newest, most advanced technology that achieves maximum carbon reduction for steelmaking, enhanced product capability and quality, and advanced manufacturing employment opportunities were explored. Extensive benchmarking and modelling were also completed in preparing the ultimate plan for the sustainability of the environment, the company, employees, customers, and the community.”  In addition to Canada, the Company has also announced investments in decarbonisation technologies in Belgium, France and Spain. Combined investment for the four projects totals US$5.6 billion, with anticipated carbon emissions reduction totalling 19.5 million tonnes, which is equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 4,240,858 cars being driven for a year[1]. These projects sit at the heart of the Company’s target to reduce its CO2e emissions intensity by 25% by 2030 group-wide, and in Europe by 35% by 2030.

{"id":6615,"text":"With this new unit, which will specialise in the production of electrical steels for the engines of electric vehicles and which complements ArcelorMittal’s existing electrical steels plant in Saint-Chély d’Apcher, in the south of France, all of the group's electrical steels will be produced in France, strengthening France’s electromobility sector.  The new production unit, which will be located on the existing ArcelorMittal site in Mardyck near Dunkirk, will produce the electrical steels used in electric motors in general (including for industrial machinery) and for electric and hybrid vehicles in particular.  These steels, which are used in engines in the form of stacks of very thin layers (0.2 to 0.35 millimeters for the automotive industry), are characterised by their magnetic and mechanical properties: high polarisation to maximise engine performance, low losses to promote vehicle autonomy, and high yield strength to support engine rotation.  The new industrial unit in Mardyck will have a 200,000-tonne production capacity and is scheduled to start up in 2024. It will strengthen the French electromobility sector, which is particularly well established in France, especially in the Hauts de France region and in Dunkirk where numerous industrial projects have been announced in recent months. As part of this contribution to the electromobility sector, ArcelorMittal’s electrical steels will contribute to achieving the European Union’s goals on the reduction of CO2 emissions from mobility. This project is supported by the French government as part of France 2030.   Agnès Pannier-Runacher, French Minister Delegate for Industry, commented: “This major investment decision comes one month after the announcement of the steel decarbonisation project in Dunkirk and Fos, to which the Prime Minister gave the State's support. This project will contribute to our goal of carbon neutrality in 2050, while allowing us to strengthen our steel production capacities.

{"id":6616,"text":"ArcelorMittal (the ‘Company’) today announces it has established a strategic partnership with Greenko Group, India’s leading energy transition company, to develop a ‘round the clock’ renewable energy project with 975 MW of nominal capacity.   The c. $0.6 billion project will combine solar and wind power and be supported by Greenko’s hydro pumped storage project, which helps to overcome the intermittent nature of wind and solar power generation.  The project will be owned and funded by ArcelorMittal. Greenko will design, construct and operate the renewable energy facilities in Andhra Pradesh, Southern India. Project commissioning is expected by mid-2024.  ArcelorMittal’s joint venture company in India, ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM\/NS India), will enter into a 25 year off-take agreement with ArcelorMittal to purchase 250 MW of renewable electricity annually from the project. This will result in over 20% of the electricity requirement at AM\/NS India’s Hazira plant coming from renewable sources, reducing carbon emissions by approximately 1.5 million tonnes per year.  The project offers AM\/NS India the dual benefits of lower electricity costs and lower CO2 emissions, and it also provides an attractive return on investment for ArcelorMittal.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “This is an attractive opportunity for ArcelorMittal. We will be partnering with a highly experienced energy transition company in a project that will enable our joint venture company AM\/NS India to reduce both its electricity costs and carbon emissions, as well as providing consistent, guaranteed returns for ArcelorMittal.  “Large amounts of green energy are one of the key foundations for both a net zero economy and a decarbonised steel industry. We are excited about the potential of replicating this model in other regions. It demonstrates how establishing partnerships and collaborating across the supply chain can help us to progress faster towards our decarbonisation targets.”  Commenting on the partnership, Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty, CEO and Managing Director at Greenko said:  “This is a pioneering partnership with the world’s leading steelmaker and we hope it will serve as a blueprint for the adoption of renewable power for large-scale steel manufacturing in India. These efforts will also represent a notable contribution to India’s own commitment to build 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.”  More details on ArcelorMittal’s climate action ambitions, strategy, technologies and ongoing decarbonisation projects can be found here.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2022-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal establishes strategic renewable energy partnership with Greenko Group in India","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"- Companies to work together to construct 975 MW of nominal solar and wind capacity - Utilising Greenko’s hydro pump storage project, 250 MW of uninterrupted renewable power will be supplied annually to AM\/NS India under 25-year off-take, reducing AM\/NS India’s carbon emissions by 1.5 million tonnes per annum","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-establishes-strategic-renewable-energy-partnership-with-greenko-group-in-india\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6620,"text":"The state-of-the-art plant, which was opened in October 2016, is one of the largest of its kind in the world. It has an annual capacity of two million tonnes of HBI, a high-quality feedstock made through the direct reduction of iron ore which is used to produce high-quality steel grades in an electric arc furnace (‘EAF’), but which can also be used in blast furnaces, resulting in lower coke consumption. HBI is a premium, compacted form of Direct Reduced Iron (‘DRI’) developed to overcome issues associated with shipping and handling DRI.  In parallel with the transaction, ArcelorMittal has signed a long-term offtake agreement with voestalpine to supply an annual volume of HBI commensurate to voestalpine’s equity stake to its steel mills in Donawitz and Linz, Austria. The remaining balance of production will be delivered to third parties under existing supply contracts, and to ArcelorMittal facilities, including to AM\/NS Calvert in Alabama, upon the commissioning of its 1.5 million tonne EAF, expected in the second half of 2023.  Commenting, ArcelorMittal CEO, Aditya Mittal, said:  “This is a compelling strategic acquisition for our company. It accelerates both our progression into producing high-quality metallic feedstock for EAFs and our global decarbonisation journey. The facility is world-class and is ideally located, with its own deep-water port. There is also unused land on the site which provides interesting options for further development.  “ArcelorMittal is already one of the world’s largest producers of DRI. This acquisition will further strengthen our position and guarantee security of supply to AM\/NS Calvert, while our experience will bring significant value to the asset. DRI is a feedstock which has a very important role to play in our decarbonisation ambitions, as we have announced plans to construct DRI facilities at several sites across Europe and in Canada. Today’s transaction therefore represents an important further step in our climate action journey. Finally, I would like to thank the executive management team at voestalpine and look forward to developing a strong partnership with them.”  The Corpus Christi facility, which covers an area of two square kilometers and employs over 270 people, is located in an optimal coastal position with direct access to a broad and deep shipping channel which enables cost effective transportation to the Americas and Europe. It incorporates best-in-class technology and equipment supplied by MIDREX Technologies Inc., a leading supplier of DRI solutions. It currently uses natural gas to directly reduce iron ore pellets into HBI with an Fe content which exceeds 91%. However, the plant does have the potential to transition to 100% hydrogen, with the Texas coast presenting advantageous weather conditions to produce renewable energy powered green hydrogen. The use of natural gas rather than coal as the current energy input and reductant means that DRI-EAF steelmaking carries a significantly lower carbon footprint than blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking. DRI\/HBI is therefore expected to play a prominent role in the decarbonisation of the steel industry, a process ArcelorMittal intends to lead.  ArcelorMittal is a world leader in DRI production, with c. nine million tonnes of annual production capacity (c. 15 million tonnes including AM\/NS India). DRI – ultimately produced using green hydrogen – sits at the heart of the Company’s Innovative-DRI steelmaking pathway, one of two pathways ArcelorMittal has developed which hold the potential to deliver carbon-neutral steelmaking.  Over the past year, the Company has accelerated its Innovative-DRI strategy, announcing projects to construct additional DRI and EAF capacity at its operations in Belgium, Canada, France and Spain. The combined investment for the four projects totals US$5.6 billion, with anticipated carbon emissions reduction totalling 19.5 million tonnes, which is [1]equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 4,240,858 cars being driven for a year. These projects sit at the heart of the company’s target to reduce its CO2e emissions intensity by 25% by 2030 group-wide, and in Europe by 35% by 2030.

Together, these companies process approximately 400,000 tonnes of material annually, the majority of which is steel scrap. The companies source material from a broad range of suppliers, contracts with municipalities and via contracts with industrial clients from a range of manufacturing sectors. The companies ship processed metal scrap and other materials to metal producers and other participants in the circular economy.  Commenting, Geert Van Poelvoorde, ArcelorMittal Europe CEO, said:  “Increasing the use of scrap in our steelmaking operations and securing access to the metallics required for low-carbon steelmaking is one component of our plans to reduce our CO2e emissions intensity by 35 per cent by 2030.

{"id":6628,"text":"Mr. Van Poelvoorde explained in detail what ArcelorMittal Europe has already done to decarbonise to date, and what it will take to move to the next, crucial phase:  “Building zero-carbon emissions steel plants across ArcelorMittal Europe means replacing the blast furnaces with DRI plants, and building electric furnaces powered by renewable energy. Replacing the natural gas with green hydrogen in the DRI plants – once green hydrogen is available at scale, and at a competitive price - will bring our CO2 emissions down by 90%. And the remaining CO2 emissions will be captured and either stored or used.  “We have a detailed plan to do this and are ready to roll out this plan; we have the investment support of the Belgian, French, German and Spanish governments, and are preparing as much as possible, while we await funding approval from the European Commission – we submitted applications for funding, on time, last summer but are still waiting for a decision.”  Speaking in his EUROFER capacity, he added that across Europe more than 60 industrial scale projects are about to be launched by steelmakers - potentially reducing the European steel industry’s CO2 emissions by 81.5 million tonnes by 2030: “That matches the annual CO2 emissions per capita of around 13 million Europeans – or more than the populations of Belgium and Luxembourg combined. No other energy-intensive industry has set out such ambition.”  ‘Votes will decide the future of steel in Europe’   Ahead of votes on the ETS revisions in the environment committee of the European Parliament next week, and a plenary vote in early June, Mr Van Poelvoorde said: “The situation is very serious, and urgent. With the revised ETS that’s on the table today, even after the whole European steel sector has cut CO2 emissions by 30% and invested €31bn in capex and €55bn in opex, the European steel sector will be paying €8.4bn a year in CO2 costs in 2030 - at a time when we will still be investing heavily in the transition phase from blast furnace-based steelmaking to DRI-EAF steelmaking.”  Linked to the ETS, he also spoke about the proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism: “We welcome this idea, and indeed we need assurance that imports will be subject to the same CO2 cost as European producers. As it is currently proposed however, the carbon border adjustment will not do this. Instead it will create a situation where European steel will be uncompetitive in the global market. We will simply not have a market for our high cost, low-emissions steel, without a level playing field.”  The industry needs a transition period  Addressing critics of the steel industry who argue that the proposed ETS reforms are needed to accelerate decarbonisation, he explained that the industry needs a transition phase to allow time to transform steelmaking sites: “Replacing blast furnaces with DRI-EAF plants takes years – after the engineering phase, we need two years for the building phase, followed by a period of testing and commissioning. For each of our planned DRI-EAF projects, we will transform an existing industrial site through brownfield investment. We therefore need a transition phase. This will allow us to continue producing via the blast furnace route – making steel in Europe and generating funds that we can reinvest building the new plants that we need for carbon-neutral steelmaking.”  Crucial need for renewable energy at scale  Access to affordable renewable energy at scale is one of the crucial pillars of carbon-neutral steelmaking – and Mr Van Poelvoorde explained why: “By 2030 the European steel industry will need 150 TWh of renewable electricity from the grid, of which half will be needed for the production of hydrogen. This is double the total electricity consumption of Belgium in 2020. Europe must accelerate the creation of a regulatory environment for green hydrogen (storage, transport); push the building of infrastructure and accelerate the permitting.”  The importance of a secure supply chain   He also reminded the audience of the importance of a secure supply chain. “Just last month, Ursula Von Der Leyen said: ‘Every euro we invest in renewables and energy efficiency is a down-payment on our future energy independence’ – and the same could be said of Europe’s steel industry. Every euro invested in carbon-neutral steelmaking in Europe, is a down-payment on a healthy supply chain for Europe’s long-term prosperity. Steel is strategic, it’s part of the critical value chain – there’s no doubt that these value chains will be significantly weakened, if steelmaking moves outside Europe.”  To find out more about ArcelorMittal’s decarbonisation strategy, visit https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/climate-action","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2022-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe CEO calls on the European Parliament to help save European steelmakers’ decarbonisation projects threatened by uncertainty","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Speaking at the multisectoral business federation FEDIL’s annual reception in Luxembourg, which was attended by Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe and President of EUROFER, spoke on the urgent topic of the decarbonisation of European steelmaking and the many uncertainties that the sector faces.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-europe-ceo-calls-on-the-european-parliament-to-help-save-european-steelmakers-decarbonisation-projects-threatened-by-uncertainty\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6657,"text":"Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) said today it added 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved oil and gas reserves in 2015, replacing 67 percent of production, including a 219 percent replacement ratio for crude oil and other liquids.\n  * 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels added to reserves; replacement ratio 67 percent\n  * Liquids replaced at a ratio of 219 percent comprising 59 percent of total proved reserves\n  * Ten-year replacement ratio of 115 percent \nAt year-end 2015, ExxonMobil's proved reserves totaled 24.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels. Liquids represented 59 percent of proved reserves, up from 54 percent in 2014. ExxonMobil’s reserves life at current production rates is 16 years.  \nIn 2015, reserves were added in Abu Dhabi, Canada, Kazakhstan and Angola. Liquid additions during 2015 totaled 1.9 billion barrels. Natural gas proved reserves were reduced by 834 million oil-equivalent barrels primarily in the United States reflecting the change in natural gas prices. The company expects this gas to be developed and booked as proved reserves in the future.\nOver the past 10 years, ExxonMobil has replaced 115 percent of the reserves it produced, including the impact of asset sales.\n“ExxonMobil has a successful track record of proved reserves replacement over the long term, demonstrating the strength of our global strategy to identify, evaluate, capture and advance high-quality opportunities,” said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer.\n“Our proved reserves represent a diverse portfolio that positions us to create shareholder value as we supply long-term energy demand growth. We will continue to apply our disciplined, paced investing approach as we develop our industry-leading resource base.”\nReserves additions in 2015 reflect new developments as well as revisions and extensions of existing fields resulting from drilling, studies and analysis of reservoir performance. The annual reporting of proved reserves is the product of the corporation’s long-standing, rigorous process that ensures consistency and management accountability in all reserves bookings. Consistent with SEC requirements, ExxonMobil reports reserves based on the historic average market prices on the first day of each calendar month during the year.\nResource Base\nDuring 2015, ExxonMobil added 1.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its resource base through by-the-bit exploration discoveries, undeveloped resource additions and strategic acquisitions.\nExxonMobil’s by-the-bit exploration success in 2015 included a significant oil discovery offshore Guyana and additional discoveries in Iraq, Australia, Romania and Nigeria. Strategic unconventional resource additions were made in the Permian Basin in West Texas, Canada and Argentina.\nOverall, the corporation’s resource base totaled more than 91 billion oil-equivalent barrels at year-end 2015, taking into account field revisions, production and asset sales. The resource base includes proved reserves, plus other discovered resources that are expected to be ultimately recovered.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE: Proved reserve figures in this release are based on current SEC definitions. Reserves also include oil sands and equity company reserves for all periods, which were excluded from SEC reserves prior to 2009.\nThe reserves replacement ratio is calculated for a specified period utilizing the applicable proved oil-equivalent reserves additions divided by oil-equivalent production.\nThe terms “resources” and “resource base” include quantities of discovered oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves but that are expected to be ultimately recovered in the future. The term “resource base” is not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as “probable” or “possible” reserves.\nThe term “project” as used in this release does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2016-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil announces 2015 reserves additions","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) said today it added 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved oil and gas reserves in 2015, replacing 67 percent of production, including a 219 percent replacement ratio for crude oil and other liquids.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2016\/0219_ExxonMobil-Announces-2015-reserves-additions","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6693,"text":"IRVING, Texas — ExxonMobil and Princeton University today announced the selection of five research projects associated with their partnership focused on energy technologies. The projects will center on solar and battery technologies, plasma physics, Arctic sea-ice modeling, and the impact of carbon dioxide absorption on the world’s oceans. \n  * Projects to focus on solar and battery technologies, plasma physics and Arctic sea-ice modeling\n  * ExxonMobil has committed $5 million toward Princeton partnership for new energy research\n  * ExxonMobil engaged in similar energy partnerships with MIT and University of Texas \nThis announcement follows ExxonMobil’s June 2015 commitment to contribute $5 million over five years to the Princeton E-ffiliates Partnership, a program administered by Princeton University’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment that fosters research in sustainable energy and environmental solutions. E-ffiliates promotes collaboration between industry and academia to search for energy and environmental breakthroughs. Over the past year, ExxonMobil scientists have collaborated with Princeton professors to identify areas with the most scientific potential, particularly ones that build on the university’s existing strengths and interests in emerging energy.  \n“Each of the five selected projects is a potential game-changer in terms of new energy development and better understanding of our natural environment,” said Eric Herbolzheimer, senior scientific advisor and section head of engineering physics at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. “For example, we will examine whether photovoltaic properties can be embedded directly into polymers that could be used as coatings on building materials. Such technologies could complement current roof-mounted solar technologies and build upon our leadership in the chemical industry.”\n“The collaboration with ExxonMobil is a win-win,” said Lynn Loo, director of Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. “ExxonMobil gains insight into new developments in emerging energy and the Princeton community benefits from industry’s view of the challenges of meeting global energy demands while being responsive to environmental impacts.”\nIn the coming months, Princeton’s professors will select graduate research students to be named ExxonMobil Emerging Technology Fellows. The five selected projects and the professors who will lead them are as follows:\nOrganic Photovoltaics: The objective is to study how new photovoltaic materials, particularly those polymeric in nature, can be applied in forms of coatings and building materials. The project will be led by Lynn Loo, director of the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, the Theodora D. '78 and William H. Walton III '74 Professor in Engineering, and professor of chemical and biological engineering.\nExtending Battery Lifetime and Cycle Efficiency: The project will use diagnostic tools recently developed at Princeton to study degradation pathways of electric-vehicle batteries, and how they might impact follow-on use in applications on the power grid, known as “second life” applications. Research will be led by Daniel Steingart, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment.\nArctic Sea-Ice Modeling: The focus of the project is to advance sea-ice models used for understanding the factors controlling Arctic sea-ice cycles and, consequently, the ability to make reliable seasonal and long-range forecasts for sea-ice formation and melting. Research will be conducted at Princeton’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, a premier institution that has been developing state-of-the-art sea-ice modeling tools for decades. The project will be led by Alistair Adcroft, research oceanographer, and Olga Sergienko, research glaciologist, at the Princeton University Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences Program\/NOAA-Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.\nRole of the Ocean in the Future of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Levels: The project’s objective is to gain insight into the future of carbon dioxide uptake by the ocean by reconstructing ocean carbon cycle changes during past periods of warming. Research will be led by Daniel Sigman, Dusenbury Professor of Geological and Geophysical Sciences.\nPlasma Physics: The project will take advantage of Princeton’s world-leading facilities for studying plasma physics. It will explore low-energy plasmas’ effectiveness in enhancing or controlling energy-related chemical processes, such as converting natural gas to larger molecules for producing liquid fuels or chemical feedstocks. Egemen Kolemen, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment and the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, is leading this research with Yiguang Ju, Robert Porter Patterson Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.\nPrinceton’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment is one of three university energy centers to partner with ExxonMobil to conduct fundamental research on technologies that can provide low-carbon energy solutions while meeting global energy demand, which is expected to rise by about 25 percent between now and 2040 as population and living standards rise. ExxonMobil’s $5 million contribution to Princeton E-ffiliates Partnership remains the program’s single largest financial commitment.\nLast month, ExxonMobil announced that it would invest $15 million to the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute to pursue technologies to help meet growing energy demand while reducing environmental impacts and the risk of climate change.\nIn 2014, ExxonMobil became a founding member of the MIT Energy Initiative, contributing $25 million over five years to support research and establish 10 graduate energy fellowship appointments each year.\nThese efforts are in addition to the more than 80 universities that ExxonMobil partners with on research programs to explore new energy solutions.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2016-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil and Princeton University announce new energy research projects","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas — ExxonMobil and Princeton University today announced the selection of five research projects associated with their partnership focused on energy technologies.

{"id":6711,"text":"HOUSTON — ExxonMobil announced today its development of cMISTTM technology, which dehydrates natural gas using a patented absorption system inside pipes and replaces the need for conventional dehydration tower technology. This “in-line” technology could be deployed at both land-based and offshore natural gas production operations.\n  * Represents a step-change in efficiency and significant reduction in operational footprint\n  * Size, weight and cost of natural gas dehydration reduced for land-based and offshore operations\n  * Technology licensed to Sulzer for commercial application across the industry \nThe new technology, developed and extensively field-tested by ExxonMobil, more efficiently removes water vapor present during the production of natural gas. Removing water vapor through the use of dehydration technology, typically accomplished using large and expensive dehydration towers, reduces corrosion and equipment interference helping to ensure the safe and efficient transport of natural gas through the supply infrastructure and ultimately to consumers.  \ncMIST reduces the size, weight and cost of dehydration, resulting in reductions of surface footprint by 70 percent and the overall dehydration system’s weight by half, which has significant added benefits on offshore applications.\n“By leveraging our industry-leading experience with upstream applications, our researchers were able to create this advanced natural gas dehydration technology, which represents a step-change in operational efficiency and a significant reduction in footprint,” said Tom Schuessler, president of ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company.\nExxonMobil’s cMIST technology relies on a proprietary droplet generator to break up conventional solvent into tiny droplets that become well dispersed in the gas flow thereby increasing the surface area for the absorption of water from the gas. This is followed by an inline separator that coalesces the water-rich glycol droplets and moves them to the outside wall of the pipe for effective separation from the dehydrated natural gas. The water-rich glycol is regenerated using a conventional system and is sent back to the droplet generator to be used again. The droplet generator uses the energy from the flowing natural gas to create droplets of the right size.\nExxonMobil has licensed cMIST technology to the Chemtech division of Sulzer, a leading player in separation technologies, to facilitate deployment across the oil and gas industry.\n“We are proud to have been selected as worldwide exclusive licensee of the cMIST technology, which includes our patented compact HiPer™ inline separator,” said Torsten Wintergerste, president of the Chemtech division. “We look forward to servicing the oil and gas industry with this unique technology, allowing for much needed reductions in capital expenditures for both greenfield projects and existing facilities seeking brownfield debottlenecking opportunities. cMIST technology complements the Sulzer line of compact multi-phase separation technologies and will maximize benefits available to oil & gas operating companies around the world.”\nExxonMobil’s Houston-based Upstream Research Company and New Jersey-based ExxonMobil Research and Engineering division develop a range of innovative technologies aimed at producing energy more efficiently.

{"id":6723,"text":"IRVING, Texas — Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today proved reserves were 20 billion oil-equivalent barrels at year-end 2016, inclusive of a net reduction of 3.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels from 2015. \nReserves changes in 2016 reflect new developments as well as revisions and extensions to existing fields resulting from drilling, studies, analysis of reservoir performance and application of the methodology prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAs a result of very low prices during 2016, certain quantities of liquids and natural gas no longer qualified as proved reserves under SEC guidelines.\nThese amounts included the entire 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl in Alberta, Canada. Another 800 million oil-equivalent barrels in North America did not qualify as proved reserves, mainly due to the acceleration of the projected economic end-of-field life. These revisions are not expected to affect the operation of the underlying projects or to alter the company’s outlook for future production volumes. The reductions were partially offset by reserves additions of oil and natural gas totaling approximately 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the U.S., Kazakhstan, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Norway, which replaced 65 percent of production and were the result of acquisitions, improved asset performance and a decision to fund an expansion of the Tengiz project in Kazakhstan.\nConsistent with SEC requirements, ExxonMobil reports reserves based on the average of the applicable market price prevailing on the first day of each calendar month during the year. Prices to date in 2017 have been higher than the average first-of-month prices in 2016. Among the factors that would result in these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline in costs, and \/ or operating efficiencies.\nThe annual reporting of proved reserves is the product of the corporation’s long-standing, rigorous process that ensures consistency and management accountability in all reserves bookings. Over the past 10 years, ExxonMobil has added proved oil and gas reserves totaling approximately 13 billion oil-equivalent barrels, including the impact of asset sales, replacing 82 percent of produced volumes. ExxonMobil’s reserves life at current production rates is 13 years. Liquids account for 53 percent of proved reserves.\nResource Base\nDuring 2016, ExxonMobil added nearly 2.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its resource base through by-the-bit exploration discoveries, undeveloped resource additions and strategic acquisitions. The resource base includes proved reserves, plus other discovered resources that are expected to be ultimately recovered.\nExxonMobil’s by-the-bit exploration success in 2016 included significant oil discoveries in Nigeria and Guyana. Strategic unconventional resource additions were made in the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania, the Permian Basin in West Texas and Neuquén Province in Argentina.\nOverall, the corporation’s resource base totaled more than 91 billion oil-equivalent barrels at year-end 2016, taking into account field revisions, production and asset sales.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE: Proved reserve figures in this release are based on current SEC definitions. Reserves also include oil sands and equity company reserves for all periods, which were excluded from SEC reserves prior to 2009.\nThe terms “resources” and “resource base” include quantities of discovered oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves but that are expected to be ultimately recovered in the future. The term “resource base” is not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as “probable” or “possible” reserves.\nThe term “project” as used in this release does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2017-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil announces 2016 reserves","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas — Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today proved reserves were 20 billion oil-equivalent barrels at year-end 2016, inclusive of a net reduction of 3.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels from 2015. \n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2017\/0222_ExxonMobil-announces-2016-reserves","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6759,"text":"IRVING, Texas & LA JOLLA, Calif. — ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics Inc. today announced a breakthrough in joint research into advanced biofuels involving the modification of an algae strain that more than doubled its oil content without significantly inhibiting the strain’s growth.\n  * Algae strain developed and modified by Synthetic Genomics more than doubled oil production\n  * Additional research and testing required before commercial application\n  * Results published in peer-reviewed journal Nature Biotechnology\nUsing advanced cell engineering technologies at Synthetic Genomics, the ExxonMobil-Synthetic Genomics research team modified an algae strain to enhance the algae’s oil content from 20 percent to more than 40 percent. Results of the research were published today in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Biotechnology by lead authors Imad Ajjawi and Eric Moellering of Synthetic Genomics.  \nResearchers at Synthetic Genomics’ laboratory in La Jolla discovered a new process for increasing oil production by identifying a genetic switch that could be fine-tuned to regulate the conversion of carbon to oil in the algae species, Nannochloropsis gaditana. The team established a proof-of-concept approach that resulted in the algae doubling its lipid fraction of cellular carbon compared to the parent – while sustaining growth.\n“This key milestone in our advanced biofuels program confirms our belief that algae can be incredibly productive as a renewable energy source with a corresponding positive contribution to our environment,” said Vijay Swarup, vice president for research and development at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. “Our work with Synthetic Genomics continues to be an important part of our broader research into lower-emission technologies to reduce the risk of climate change.”\n“The major inputs for phototropic algae production are sunlight and carbon dioxide, two resources that are abundant, sustainable and free,” said Oliver Fetzer, Ph.D., chief executive officer at Synthetic Genomics. “Discoveries made through our partnership with ExxonMobil demonstrate how advanced cell engineering capabilities at Synthetic Genomics can unlock biology to optimize how we use these resources and create solutions for many of today’s sustainability challenges – from renewable energy to nutrition and human health.”\nAlgae has been regarded as a potential sustainable fuel option, but researchers have been hindered for the past decade in developing a strain that is high in oil content and grows quickly – two critical characteristics for scalable and cost-efficient oil production. Slower growth has been an adverse effect of previous attempts to increase algae oil production volume.\nA key objective of the ExxonMobil-Synthetic Genomics collaboration has been to increase the lipid content of algae while decreasing the starch and protein components without inhibiting the algae’s growth. Limiting availability of nutrients such as nitrogen is one way to increase oil production in algae, but it can also dramatically inhibit or even stop photosynthesis, stunting algae growth and ultimately the volume of oil produced.\nThe ability to sustain growth while increasing oil content is an important advance. Algae has other advantages over traditional biofuels because it can grow in salt water and thrive in harsh environmental conditions, therefore limiting stress on food and fresh water supplies.\nOil from algae can also potentially be processed in conventional refineries, producing fuels no different from convenient, energy-dense diesel. Oil produced from algae also holds promise as a potential feedstock for chemical manufacturing.\n“The SGI-ExxonMobil science teams have made significant advances over the last several years in efforts to optimize lipid production in algae. This important publication today is evidence of this work, and we remain convinced that synthetic biology holds crucial answers to unlocking the potential of algae as a renewable energy source,” said J. Craig Venter, Ph.D., Synthetic Genomics co-founder and chairman. “We look forward to continued work with ExxonMobil so that eventually we will indeed have a viable alternative energy source.”\nSince 2009, ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics have been partners in researching and developing oil from algae to be used as a renewable, lower-emission alternative to traditional transportation fuels. Swarup said that while the breakthrough is an important step, the technology is still many years from potentially reaching the commercial market.\n“Advancements as potentially important as this require significant time and effort, as is the case with any research and development project,” Swarup said. “Each phase of our algae research, or any other similar project in the area of advanced biofuels, requires testing and analysis to confirm that we’re proceeding down a path toward scale and commercial viability.”\nExxonMobil is engaged in a wide range of research on advanced biofuels, partnering with universities, government laboratories, and other companies. Global demand for transportation-related energy is projected to increase by about 25 percent through 2040, and accelerating the reduction in emissions from the transportation sector will play a critical role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.\nExxonMobil is also actively researching other emission-reducing technologies, including carbon capture and sequestration. In 2016, ExxonMobil announced its partnership with Connecticut-based FuelCell Energy, Inc. to advance the use of carbonate fuel cells to economically capture carbon emissions from power plants while generating hydrogen and additional electricity. Since 2000, ExxonMobil has spent about $8 billion to develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions across its operations.\nNote to editors: \nVijay Swarup, Craig Venter and Oliver Fetzer will discuss the research breakthrough and answer questions during a media briefing scheduled for 10 a.m. PDT today at the San Diego Convention Center, located at 111 W. Harbor Drive, in Room 32B on the upper level. The live briefing and replay may also be accessed online via an interactive webcast.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2017-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics report breakthrough in algae biofuel research","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas & LA JOLLA, Calif. — ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics Inc. today announced a breakthrough in joint research into advanced biofuels involving the modification of an algae strain that more than doubled its oil content without significantly inhibiting the strain’s growth.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2017\/0619_ExxonMobil-and-Synthetic-Genomics-report-breakthrough-in-algae-biofuel-research","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":6783,"text":"IRVING, Texas — Exxon Mobil Corporation announced estimated third quarter 2017 earnings of $4 billion, or $0.93 per diluted share, compared with $2.7 billion a year earlier as commodity prices improved and performance in the Upstream and Downstream strengthened. Impacts related to Hurricane Harvey reduced earnings by an estimated 4 cents per share.\n  * Cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeds dividends and net investments1 for the fourth-consecutive quarter\n  * Company makes fifth Guyana discovery; captures 12 high-potential blocks offshore Brazil\n  * Hurricane Harvey reduces earnings by an estimated $160 million, or 4 cents per share\n“A 50 percent increase in earnings through solid business performance and higher commodity prices is a step forward in our plan to grow profitability,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “For the fourth-consecutive quarter, we generated cash flow from operations and asset sales that more than covered our dividends and net investments in the business.”\nUpstream earnings rose to $1.6 billion as commodity prices increased. Building on its recent success in deepwater exploration, such as the Turbot discovery in Guyana, ExxonMobil added 12 offshore blocks in Brazil, capturing acreage with high resource potential and competitive fiscal terms.\nDownstream results increased to $1.5 billion, despite Hurricane Harvey impacts and the absence of favorable asset management gains of $380 million in the prior year from the sale of Canadian retail assets. These results were achieved as the company worked quickly to safely bring refineries back online following the storm and to restore product supplies.\nChemical earnings were $1.1 billion, down slightly from a year ago on lower commodity margins and hurricane impacts, partially offset by volume growth. During the quarter the company enhanced its position to capture growing demand in Asia by completing the purchase of an aromatics plant in Singapore.\n1 Includes additions to property, plant and equipment and net investments \/ advances\n Third Quarter 2017 Highlights\n  * Earnings of $4 billion increased 50 percent from the third quarter of 2016.\n  * Earnings per share assuming dilution were $0.93.\n  * Cash flow from operations and asset sales increased 33 percent to $8.4 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $854 million.\n  * Capital and exploration expenditures were $6 billion, including an aromatics plant acquisition in Singapore.\n  * Oil-equivalent production was 3.9 million barrels per day, up 2 percent from the prior year. Excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil-equivalent production remained at 2 percent higher than the prior year.\n  * The corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to shareholders.\n  * Dividends per share of $0.77 increased 2.7 percent compared to the third quarter of 2016.\n  * The company acquired an interest in 12 blocks offshore Brazil during the last bid round completed during the quarter. The bid resulted in the addition of 2 million high-potential acres with competitive fiscal terms.\n  * The company completed the Turbot-1 exploration well offshore Guyana. The well encountered 75 feet (23 meters) of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone, and represents ExxonMobil’s fifth discovery to date in the country.\n  * ExxonMobil signed a production sharing contract for Block 59 located 190 miles (305 kilometers) offshore Suriname. The deepwater block has an area of 2.8 million acres and significantly expands the corporation’s operated acreage in the Guyana-Suriname basin.\n  * During the quarter, ExxonMobil announced it added 22,000 acres since May to its Permian Basin portfolio through a series of acquisitions and acreage trades. Located in the Delaware and Midland Basins, the new acreage adds over 400 million oil-equivalent barrels to the company’s existing Permian Basin resource base of 6 billion oil-equivalent barrels.\n  * ExxonMobil completed the acquisition of one of the world’s largest aromatics facilities, located in Singapore, from Jurong Aromatics Corporation Pte Ltd. The acquisition will provide operational and logistical synergies between the plant and ExxonMobil’s integrated refining and petrochemical complex, as well as increase ExxonMobil Singapore’s aromatics production to over 3.5 million metric tons per year.\n Third Quarter 2017 vs. Third Quarter 2016\nUpstream earnings were $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2017, up $947 million from the third quarter of 2016. Higher liquids and gas realizations increased earnings by $860 million. Higher volume and mix effects increased earnings by $20 million. All other items increased earnings by $70 million as lower expenses were partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects.\nOn an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 2 percent from the third quarter of 2016. Liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day, up 69,000 barrels per day as lower downtime and higher project volumes were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production was 9.6 billion cubic feet per day, down 16 million cubic feet per day from 2016 as field decline and lower demand were partly offset by project ramp-up, primarily in Australia, and work programs.\nU.S. Upstream results were a loss of $238 million in the third quarter of 2017, compared to a loss of $477 million in the third quarter of 2016. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $1.8 billion, up $708 million from the prior year.\nDownstream earnings were $1.5 billion, up $303 million from the third quarter of 2016. Higher refining margins increased earnings by $1 billion. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $160 million. All other items decreased earnings by $550 million, reflecting the absence of favorable asset management gains of $380 million in the prior year from the sale of Canadian retail assets and higher expenses related to Hurricane Harvey. Petroleum product sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 43,000 barrels per day lower than last year’s third quarter.\nEarnings from the U.S. Downstream were $391 million, up $166 million from the third quarter of 2016. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $1.1 billion were $137 million higher than prior year.\nChemical earnings of $1.1 billion were $79 million lower than the third quarter of 2016.

Non-U.S. Chemical earnings of $689 million were $48 million lower than prior year.\nCorporate and financing expenses were $221 million for the third quarter of 2017, down $149 million from the third quarter of 2016 mainly due to favorable impacts from the resolution of long-standing tax items.\n First Nine Months 2017 Highlights\n  * Earnings of $11.3 billion increased 84 percent from $6.2 billion in 2016.\n  * Earnings per share assuming dilution were $2.66.\n  * Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $24.4 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $1.7 billion.\n  * Capital and exploration expenditures were $14.1 billion, down 3 percent from 2016.\n  * Oil-equivalent production was 4 million barrels per day, down 1 percent from the prior year. Excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil-equivalent production was up 1 percent from the prior year.\n  * The corporation distributed $9.7 billion in dividends to shareholders.\n First Nine Months 2017 vs. First Nine Months 2016\nUpstream earnings were $5 billion, up $4.2 billion from 2016. Higher realizations increased earnings by $4.1 billion. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $300 million. All other items increased earnings by $380 million, primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by unfavorable tax items in the current year.\nOn an oil-equivalent basis, production of 4 million barrels per day was down 1 percent compared to 2016. Liquids production of 2.3 million barrels per day decreased 65,000 barrels per day as field decline and lower entitlements were partly offset by increased project volumes and work programs. Natural gas production of 10.1 billion cubic feet per day increased 106 million cubic feet per day from 2016 as project ramp-up, primarily in Australia, was partly offset by field decline.\nU.S. Upstream results were a loss of $439 million in 2017, compared to a loss of $1.8 billion in 2016. Earnings outside the U.S. were $5.4 billion, up $2.8 billion from the prior year.\nDownstream earnings of $4 billion increased $1.1 billion from 2016. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $1.3 billion, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $110 million. All other items decreased earnings by $290 million, mainly reflecting the absence of the Canadian retail assets sale. Petroleum product sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 26,000 barrels per day higher than 2016.\nU.S. Downstream earnings were $1 billion, an increase of $206 million from 2016. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $3 billion, up $867 million from the prior year.\nChemical earnings of $3.2 billion decreased $495 million from 2016. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $320 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $70 million. All other items decreased earnings by $250 million, primarily due to higher expenses from increased turnaround activity and new business growth. Prime product sales of 18.6 million metric tons were up 22,000 metric tons from the first nine months of 2016.\nU.S. Chemical earnings were $1.4 billion, down $111 million from 2016. Non-U.S. Chemical earnings of $1.8 billion were $384 million lower than prior year.\nCorporate and financing expenses were $954 million in 2017 compared to $1.4 billion in 2016, with the decrease mainly due to favorable impacts from the resolution of long-standing tax items.\nDuring the first nine months of 2017, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 6 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $496 million. These shares were acquired to offset dilution in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. The corporation will continue to acquire shares to offset dilution in conjunction with its benefit plans and programs, but does not currently plan on making purchases to reduce shares outstanding. The company also issued a combined 96 million shares of common stock during the first quarter to complete the acquisition of InterOil Corporation and the acquisition of entities that own oil and gas properties located primarily in the Permian Basin.\n Forward-looking Statements\nAs part of its annual planning and budgeting cycle which is completed in the fourth quarter each year, the corporation develops crude and natural gas price outlooks as well as estimates of future costs and other factors necessary to complete its plan. Management’s price outlook and other factors, including factors such as operating costs, resource productivity, and capital efficiency, are re-assessed when facts and circumstances warrant but no less often than annually. To the extent any impairment testing may be required, management uses assumptions that are reasonable in relation to these factors in developing estimates of future cash flows. An asset group would be impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the asset’s carrying value, and impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. Development of future undiscounted cash flow estimates requires significant management judgment, particularly in cases where an asset’s life is expected to extend decades into the future, and an important component of the estimate is management’s outlook on prices and other factors as noted above.\nThe corporation has identified emerging trends such as increasing estimates of available natural gas supplies and ongoing reductions in costs of supply for natural gas. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the corporation will incorporate the impacts of these trends and the resulting lower price outlook in its annual planning and budgeting cycle. Once complete, the corporation expects to perform an impairment assessment for its North American natural gas asset groups utilizing the information developed as part of the planning and budgeting process. It is not practicable at this time to estimate the impact these trends would have on the undiscounted cash flows for individual asset groups or any resulting impairment charges. However these trends are likely to place the corporation’s North American natural gas asset groups at risk for potential impairment. The corporation will complete its analysis of relevant factors as discussed above and perform any necessary impairment testing in connection with the preparation of the corporation’s year-end financial statements for inclusion in its 2017 Form 10-K.\nExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters during a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on October 27, 2017.

{"id":6807,"text":"IRVING, Texas — Exxon Mobil Corporation announced estimated 2017 earnings of $19.7 billion, or $4.63 per share assuming dilution, compared with $7.8 billion in 2016. U.S. federal tax reform in the fourth quarter resulted in a non-cash earnings gain of $5.9 billion, due to revaluation of deferred income tax balances. Non-cash asset impairments of $1.5 billion were recorded during the year, mainly relating to assets in the Upstream.\n  * Net favorable non-cash impacts in the fourth quarter total $4.6 billion, including $5.9 billion relating to U.S. tax reform, partially offset by asset impairments of $1.3 billion\n  * Full year cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeds dividends and net investments1\n  * Company makes sixth discovery offshore Guyana, adds acreage in Brazil, closes acquisition in Mozambique\nFourth quarter 2017 earnings were $8.4 billion. Earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were $3.7 billion, or $0.88 per share assuming dilution, in the fourth quarter 2017, down 2 percent compared with the prior-year quarter.\n“The impact of tax reform on our earnings reflects the magnitude of our historic investment in the U.S. and strengthens our commitment to further grow our business here,” said Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “We’re planning to invest over $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years to increase production of profitable volumes and enhance our integrated portfolio, which is supported by the improved business climate created by tax reform.”\nExxonMobil is investing billions of dollars to increase oil production in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, expand existing operations, enhance infrastructure and build new manufacturing sites. These high-quality investments will create value for ExxonMobil shareholders while benefiting the economy, creating thousands of jobs and enhancing energy security.\nFourth quarter Upstream earnings were $8.4 billion, including $7.1 billion from U.S. tax reform and asset impairments of $1.3 billion. Fourth quarter earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments increased $1 billion, to $2.5 billion, driven by higher prices as liquids realizations increased more than $10 per barrel.\nDownstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion, including $618 million from U.S. tax reform. Earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments declined $289 million, to $952 million, as the absence of last year’s Canada retail divestment gain of $522 million was partially offset by higher margins and asset management gains in the current quarter.\nChemical earnings were $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding the $335 million impact from U.S. tax reform, Chemical earnings increased $63 million, or 7 percent, due to higher sales. Prime product sales of 6.8 million metric tons were the highest in a decade.\n1 Includes additions to property, plant and equipment and net investments \/ advances\n Fourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\n  * Earnings of $8.4 billion increased $6.7 billion from the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were $3.7 billion, down 2 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\n  * Earnings per share assuming dilution were $1.97.\n  * Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.8 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $1.4 billion.\n  * Capital and exploration expenditures were $9 billion, including acquisitions in Mozambique and Brazil.\n  * Oil-equivalent production was 4 million barrels per day, down 3 percent from the prior year. Excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil-equivalent production was down 1 percent from the prior year.\n  * The corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to shareholders.\n  * Dividends per share of $0.77 increased 2.7 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\n  * The company announced the sixth oil discovery offshore Guyana with the completion of the Ranger-1 exploration well. The well encountered 230 feet (70 meters) of oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. Previous discoveries offshore Guyana are now estimated to total more than 3.2 billion recoverable oil-equivalent barrels, excluding Ranger.\n  * ExxonMobil completed an agreement with Statoil ASA to acquire an interest in the BM-S-8 block offshore Brazil, which contains part of the discovered pre-salt Carcara oil field. ExxonMobil and its partners were also the high bidder on the North Carcara block in round 2 of the pre-salt tender. The Carcara field contains an estimated recoverable resource of 2 billion barrels of high-quality oil. During the quarter, through bid rounds and announced farm-in agreements, ExxonMobil added 14 offshore blocks in Brazil comprising more than 1.25 million net acres.\n  * ExxonMobil announced the completion of a transaction to acquire a 25 percent indirect interest in Mozambique’s gas-rich Area 4 block from Eni S.p.A. and assume responsibility for midstream operations. ExxonMobil will lead the construction and operation of all future natural gas liquefaction and related facilities. The deepwater Area 4 block contains an estimated 85 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to support a world-class LNG development.\n  * During the quarter, ExxonMobil announced that the Hebron field started production safely and on schedule. The platform, located about 200 miles (350 kilometers) offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, is expected to produce up to 150,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak.\n  * The company started the Odoptu Stage 2 project safely and on schedule. The project has increased the Odoptu field production capacity to nearly 65,000 barrels per day and will help maintain Sakhalin-1 production levels.\n  * The company announced that it encountered hydrocarbons after drilling the onshore P’nyang South-2 well, located in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea, adding to a growing high-quality resource base that will underpin a multi-train LNG expansion.\n  * ExxonMobil, together with its partners Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and INPEX Corporation, announced an agreement to increase production capacity from the Upper Zakum oil field to 1 million barrels per day by 2024. Under the agreement, ExxonMobil and INPEX Corporation have also been granted a 10 year extension for the Upper Zakum concession.\n  * During the quarter, ExxonMobil acquired a crude oil terminal in Wink, Texas, from Genesis Energy, L.P. The terminal is located in the rapidly growing Permian Basin and is strategically positioned to handle crude oil and condensate for transport to Gulf Coast refineries and marine export terminals.\n  * ExxonMobil signed production sharing contracts with the government of Mauritania for three deepwater offshore blocks. Together, the blocks comprise nearly 8.4 million acres and are located an average of 125 miles (200 kilometers) offshore Mauritania.\n  * The corporation announced that the Neuquén Province government in Argentina has approved the investment plan for the development of a 35-year unconventional exploitation concession in the Los Toldos I South block. The initial investment of about $200 million calls for a pilot project of up to seven production wells, the construction of production facilities and the development of export infrastructure.\n  * The corporation combined its refining and marketing operations into a single company, ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants Company, in the first quarter of 2018. The further integration will help the company to better respond to the needs of its customers and compete more effectively.\n  * ExxonMobil opened eight service stations in Mexico during the quarter, the first Mobil-branded service stations in the country. The new service stations will be operated by Grupo Orsan and supplied with gasoline and diesel produced by ExxonMobil’s refineries in Texas. The corporation plans to open more than 50 Mobil stations in Mexico during the first quarter of 2018.\n  * During the quarter, the company started producing on-spec product from the world’s largest hydrocarbon resin plant, located in Singapore. The new facility will produce 90,000 metric tons per year of Escorez adhesive resins to meet long-term demand growth in Asia Pacific and will double the company’s capacity to manufacture high-performance resins.\n Fourth Quarter 2017 vs. Fourth Quarter 2016\nUpstream earnings were $8.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, up $9 billion from the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher liquids and gas realizations increased earnings by $1.2 billion. Lower volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $110 million. All other items increased earnings by $7.9 billion driven by U.S. tax reform impacts of $7.1 billion, lower asset impairments of $847 million, and gains from asset management activity.\nOn an oil-equivalent basis, production was down 130,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day, down 133,000 barrels per day as field decline and lower entitlements were partly offset by higher volumes from work programs and projects. Natural gas production was 10.4 billion cubic feet per day, up 17 million cubic feet per day from 2016, as project ramp-up and work programs were partly offset by field decline and lower demand.\nU.S. Upstream earnings were $7.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, including $7.6 billion for tax reform and asset impairments of $481 million. U.S. Upstream earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were a loss of $60 million. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $1.3 billion, including asset impairments of $807 million and unfavorable impacts of $480 million from U.S. tax reform. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were $2.6 billion.\nDownstream earnings were $1.6 billion, up $323 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher margins increased earnings by $250 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $190 million. All other items increased earnings by $260 million, including favorable U.S. tax reform impacts of $618 million and gains from asset management activity, partially offset by the absence of asset management gains of $522 million in the prior year from the Canada retail divestment. Petroleum product sales of 5.6 million barrels per day were 118,000 barrels per day higher than last year’s fourth quarter.\nEarnings from the U.S. Downstream were $918 million. Excluding U.S. tax reform impacts of $618 million and asset impairments, earnings were up $36 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $646 million were $325 million lower than the prior year.\nChemical earnings of $1.3 billion were $398 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $30 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $100 million. All other items increased earnings by $330 million, driven by U.S. tax reform impacts of $335 million. Fourth quarter prime product sales of 6.8 million metric tons were 473,000 metric tons or 7 percent higher than the prior year.\nU.S. Chemical earnings were $777 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding U.S. tax reform impacts of $335 million, earnings were $90 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-U.S. Chemical earnings of $493 million were $27 million lower than prior year.\nCorporate and financing expenses were $2.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, up $3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2016 mainly due to unfavorable impacts of $2.1 billion from U.S. tax reform and the absence of favorable non-U.S. tax items in the prior-year quarter.\n Full Year 2017 Highlights\n  * Earnings of $19.7 billion increased 151 percent from $7.8 billion in 2016. Earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were $15.3 billion, up 52 percent from $10.1 billion in 2016. Hurricane Harvey reduced earnings by an estimated $250 million.\n  * Earnings per share assuming dilution were $4.63.\n  * Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $33.2 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $3.1 billion.\n  * Capital and exploration expenditures were $23.1 billion, up 20 percent from 2016.\n  * Oil-equivalent production was 4 million barrels per day, down 2 percent from the prior year. Excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil-equivalent production was flat with the prior year.\n  * The corporation distributed $13 billion in dividends to shareholders.\n Full Year 2017 vs. Full Year 2016\nUpstream earnings were $13.4 billion, up $13.2 billion from 2016. Higher realizations increased earnings by $5.3 billion. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $440 million. All other items increased earnings by $8.3 billion, primarily due to the $7.1 billion non-cash impact from U.S. tax reform, lower asset impairments of $659 million, lower expenses, and gains from asset management activity.\nOn an oil-equivalent basis, production of 4 million barrels per day was down 2 percent compared to 2016. Liquids production of 2.3 million barrels per day decreased 82,000 barrels per day as field decline and lower entitlements were partly offset by increased project volumes and work programs. Natural gas production of 10.2 billion cubic feet per day increased 84 million cubic feet per day from 2016 as project ramp-up, primarily in Australia, was partly offset by field decline and regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands.\nU.S. Upstream earnings were $6.6 billion in 2017, including $7.6 billion of tax reform benefits and asset impairments of $521 million. U.S. Upstream earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were a loss of $459 million. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $6.7 billion, including asset impairments of $983 million and unfavorable impacts of $480 million from U.S. tax reform. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments were $8.2 billion.\nDownstream earnings of $5.6 billion increased $1.4 billion from 2016. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $1.5 billion, while volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $30 million. All other items decreased earnings by $40 million, driven by the absence of a $904 million gain from the Canadian retail assets sale, and Hurricane Harvey related expenses, which were mostly offset by $618 million of U.S. tax reform impacts and non-U.S. asset management gains in the current year. Petroleum product sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 48,000 barrels per day higher than 2016.\nEarnings from the U.S. Downstream were $1.9 billion. Excluding U.S. tax reform impacts of $618 million and asset impairments, earnings were up $179 million from 2016. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $3.6 billion, compared to $3.1 billion in the prior year.\nChemical earnings of $4.5 billion decreased $97 million from 2016. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $260 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $100 million. All other items increased earnings by $60 million, primarily due to U.S. tax reform of $335 million and improved inventory effects, partially offset by higher expenses from increased turnaround activity and new business growth. Prime product sales of 25.4 million metric tons were up 495,000 metric tons from 2016.\nU.S. Chemical earnings were $2.2 billion in 2017. Excluding U.S. tax reform impacts of $335 million, 2017 earnings were down $21 million from 2016. Non-U.S. Chemical earnings of $2.3 billion were $411 million lower than prior year.\nCorporate and financing expenses were $3.8 billion in 2017 compared to $1.2 billion in 2016, with the increase mainly due to unfavorable impacts of $2.1 billion from U.S. tax reform and the absence of favorable non-U.S. tax items.\nDuring 2017, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 6 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $496 million. These shares were acquired to offset dilution in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. The corporation will continue to acquire shares to offset dilution in conjunction with its benefit plans and programs, but does not currently plan on making purchases to reduce shares outstanding. The company also issued a combined 96 million shares of common stock during the first quarter to complete the acquisition of InterOil Corporation and the acquisition of entities that own oil and gas properties located primarily in the Permian Basin.\n U.S. Tax Reform\nFollowing the December 22, 2017, enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the corporation has included reasonable estimates of the income tax effects of the change in tax law and tax rate. These include amounts for the deferred income tax impact from the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and profits.\nExxonMobil’s significant historical investments in the U.S. have created large deferred income tax liabilities that have reduced previously reported earnings. Remeasurement of these deferred income tax liabilities from the 35 percent rate to 21 percent results in a one-time non-cash benefit to earnings. The corporation has paid taxes on non-U.S. earnings at tax rates on average above the U.S. rate of 35 percent. As a result, the deemed repatriation tax is not a significant item for ExxonMobil.\n Asset Impairments\nAs part of its 2017 annual planning and budgeting cycle, the corporation made a decision to cease development planning activities and further allocation of capital to certain non-producing assets outside the U.S. resulting in an after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of $807 million to reduce the carrying value of those assets. In addition, and in part due to a reduction to the corporation’s long-term natural gas price outlooks, certain asset groups were subject to an impairment assessment. As a result of that assessment, the carrying values for certain asset groups in the U.S. were reduced to fair value, resulting in an after-tax charge of $481 million. The asset groups subject to this impairment charge are primarily dry gas operations with little additional development potential.\nExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters during a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on February 2, 2018.

{"id":6808,"text":"IRVING, Texas--ExxonMobil today released its \nThey are in response to a 2017 shareholder resolution seeking additional climate disclosures about the impacts of technology advances and global climate change policies on the company.\nThe Energy & Carbon Summary and a new special section in the annual Outlook for Energy include consideration of the impact on future energy demand from an analysis of multiple lower-carbon scenarios published by the Stanford University Energy Modeling Forum. The forum’s scenarios are publicly available and are used for analytical purposes, including by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nThe global scenarios assessed by ExxonMobil, which include a full range of energy technologies, contemplate limiting global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to have a likely chance of holding atmospheric concentrations to the equivalent of 450 parts per million CO2 in 2100; these scenarios are generally considered to be consistent with pathways that would limit global average temperature rise in 2100 to 2oC above pre-industrial levels.\nThe company’s analysis of these 2oC scenarios examined the mean of the annual average demand growth rates of the various model outputs between 2010 and 2040 for multiple sources of energy. This analysis of these 2oC scenarios indicates: total energy demand increases about 0.5 percent per year; oil demand decreases about 0.4 percent per year; natural gas demand increases about 0.9 percent per year; coal demand decreases about 2.4 percent per year; and renewables demand increases about 4.5 percent per year.\nAll energy sources remain important across the assessed 2oC scenarios to 2040. As a result of ongoing demand coupled with natural hydrocarbon field decline, trillions of dollars of additional investment in oil and gas production will be required, including to meet a 2oC pathway. Based on the average growth rates of assessed 2oC scenarios, natural gas demand is estimated to increase to 445 billion cubic feet per day by 2040; oil demand is estimated to decline to 78 million barrels per day by 2040.\n“Our job is to supply the energy the world needs in an environmentally responsible way,” said Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). “It’s a dual challenge – we need to meet society’s growing need for energy while addressing the risks of climate change. We are committed to being part of the solution by investing in new technologies that can provide economic solutions on a globally scalable basis. ”\nMany experts agree that advancements will be needed to reach and maintain a 2oC pathway through 2100. ExxonMobil has invested billions of dollars in research and development, including multiple university and business partnerships around the globe, aimed at achieving the technical breakthroughs required.\n“Since 2000, our investments to develop lower-emission energy solutions have totaled about $8 billion,” Woods said. “We are deploying technologies such as cogeneration and carbon capture and storage, while researching next-generation solutions such as algae biofuels and advanced carbon capture using fuel cells. Continued research will be critical.”\nWith growing global populations and economies, key levers to address the risks of climate change include further energy efficiency improvements and reducing the GHG intensity of the world’s energy system. “For our part, we continue to take action to mitigate our emissions and help consumers lessen their GHG impact,” Woods said.\nExxonMobil’s Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040 describes a rapidly growing global population and rise in living standards in developing countries that will drive a growth in worldwide energy demand of about 25 percent from 2016 to 2040. At the same time, energy efficiency gains and gradual reductions in the GHG intensity of the energy system, will help to moderate energy use and reduce by nearly 45 percent the carbon intensity of the global economy, according to the report.\nEmerging economies in countries that are not part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will account for essentially all energy demand growth, led by an expanding Asia-Pacific region.\nAs prosperity rises, electrification continues as a significant global trend. Energy demand for power generation accounts for about 50 percent of global demand growth, with much of that coming from non-OECD countries.\n“Natural gas use is likely to increase more than any other energy source, around 40 percent, with about half its growth for electricity generation,” said T.J. Wojnar, vice president for Corporate Strategic Planning. “The abundance and versatility of natural gas, in addition to its significant air quality benefits, make it a valuable energy source to meet a wide variety of needs, while also helping the world to shift to a less carbon-intensive source of energy.”\nAmong the most rapidly expanding energy supplies will be electricity from solar and wind, together growing about 400 percent.\nWhile energy demand will grow, global carbon dioxide emissions are likely to peak by 2040, at about 10 percent above 2016 levels, as energy sources shift toward lower-emission fuels such as natural gas, renewables, and nuclear.\nThe Outlook predicts a rise in electric vehicles as well as efficiency improvements in conventional engines. This will likely lead to a peak in liquid fuels use by the world’s light-duty vehicle fleet by 2030. However, oil will continue to play a leading role in the world’s energy mix.\n“Our in-depth analysis shows that even if every light-duty vehicle in the world was fully electric by 2040, the demand for liquids could still be similar to levels seen in 2013,” said Wojnar. “This is because of growing demand from commercial transportation and the chemical sector.”\nThe Outlook for Energy is ExxonMobil’s long-range forecast developed through data-driven analysis, reflecting broad knowledge of energy markets and the expertise of economists, engineers, and scientists. It examines energy supply and demand trends for approximately 100 regional\/country areas, 15 demand sectors and 20 different energy types. ExxonMobil uses the forecast as a foundation for its business strategies and to help guide multi-billion dollar investment decisions.\nKey findings from this year’s Outlook:\n  * In 2040, oil and natural gas continue to supply about 55 percent of the world’s energy needs; oil continues to provide the largest share of the energy mix with demand rising about 20 percent driven by commercial transportation and chemicals.\n  * Nuclear and renewable energy sources are likely to account for nearly 40 percent of the growth in global energy demand to 2040.\n  * The share of the world’s electricity generated by coal is expected to fall to less than 30 percent in 2040 from approximately 40 percent in 2016.\n  * Increasing electrification of light-duty vehicles is anticipated to grow strongly.

As part of its commitment, ExxonMobil will contribute $20 million in funding over five years to research and develop lower-carbon energy solutions.\nThe Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance builds on the success of the Global Climate and Energy Project (GCEP), also led by Stanford, which focused exclusively on low-emissions, high-efficiency energy technologies. ExxonMobil has sponsored GCEP since its inception in 2002 with a commitment of $100 million and additional contributions toward specific projects. In its 15 years of work, GCEP has evolved into a pioneering collaboration of scientists, engineers, researchers and students focused on identifying breakthrough low greenhouse gas emission energy technologies that could be developed and deployed on a large scale.\n“ExxonMobil has worked with Stanford to advance low-carbon technologies over the last 15 years, and we’re excited to be the first founding member of this new endeavor,” said Bruce March, president of the ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. “Identifying scalable solutions for addressing the dual challenge of supplying energy to meet global demand while minimizing the risk of climate change is one of our core missions. We are continuously looking for ways to improve existing supply options and manufacturing processes while managing carbon intensity.”\nSince its creation, GCEP has sponsored more than 100 research programs in the United States, Europe, Australia, China and Japan, and has resulted in over 900 papers in leading journals and more than 1,200 presentations at conferences. Building on fundamental science, significant advances have been made in the areas of photovoltaic energy, renewable and lower carbon fossil fuels, batteries and fuel cells. More than 60 technologies have also been developed and 15 patents have been issued. Multiple companies have also started up as a direct result of or inspiration from GCEP research.\nThe new Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance will pair industry alliance members and Stanford professors who share common research objectives across the spectrum of energy topics from science and engineering to policy and business. Managed by the Stanford Precourt Institute for Energy, the alliance will also fund some early-stage research at the direction of its faculty leadership.\nExxonMobil’s support for the Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance expands the company’s collaborative efforts with other academic and research institutions that are focused on developing an array of new energy technologies, improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The company currently works with about 80 universities in the United States, Europe and Asia to explore next-generation energy technologies, including founding members of MIT Energy Initiative, Princeton E-ffiliates Partnership and University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2018-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil to join Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas — Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today announced that it will become the first founding member of the \n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2018\/0301_ExxonMobil-to-join-Stanford-Strategic-Energy-Alliance","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

A final decision on the investment, anticipated to be several hundred million dollars, is expected later this year. Facility startup could come as early as 2021.\nThe new facility will be capable of producing advanced polypropylene products which can be used in high performance automotive, appliance, and packaging applications. The potential project will create more than 600 jobs during peak construction and more than 60 permanent jobs when production starts.\n“ExxonMobil is well positioned to take advantage of the growing global demand for higher-value products, in both North America and the high-growth Asia Pacific region,” said John Verity, president of ExxonMobil Chemical Company. “Abundant supplies of domestically produced oil and natural gas have reduced energy costs and created new sources of feedstock for U.S. chemical manufacturing. Most of our planned investment in the Gulf Coast region is focused on supplying emerging markets like Asia with high-demand products, which ultimately will spur new economic growth locally.”\nThese advanced polypropylene materials are key to reducing vehicle weight, which helps improve fuel efficiency and reduces carbon emissions. Modern plastics and polymer composites, which can replace steel in many applications, typically comprise about 50 percent of a new car’s volume but only 10 percent of its weight.\n“Polypropylene delivers performance and sustainability benefits to produce a wide variety of consumer products,” said Cindy Shulman, ExxonMobil’s vice president of plastics and resins. “It’s a versatile material providing high impact resistance and high stiffness to lightweight applications. It is safe, can be recycled and requires less energy to produce when compared with other plastics.”\nThis investment is one of 13 new facilities planned to grow ExxonMobil’s chemical manufacturing capacity in North America and Asia Pacific by about 40 percent. These investments, including two world-class steam crackers in the United States, will enable the company to meet increasing demand in Asia and other growing markets.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2018-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil considers polypropylene production expansion along U.S. Gulf Coast","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas — ExxonMobil said today it has started detailed engineering work on a potential U.S. Gulf Coast project to expand polypropylene manufacturing capacity by up to 450,000 tons a year to meet growing demand for high-performance, lightweight durable plastics.

The new facility would help meet expected demand growth for chemical products in China.\n  * Company is evaluating a multibillion-dollar investment in Guangdong Province\n  * Project would help meet expected chemical demand growth in China\n  * Part of company’s plans to grow manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and Asia Pacific\nThe multibillion-dollar project, which remains subject to a final investment decision, would include a 1.2 million-tons-per-year ethylene flexible feed steam cracker, two performance polyethylene lines and two differentiated performance polypropylene lines. ExxonMobil’s decision to proceed with the project will be based on a number of factors, including receipt of permits and project competitiveness. Startup is planned for 2023.\n“Our agreement with the Guangdong Provincial Government demonstrates ExxonMobil’s interest in advancing this project from concept to completion,” said John Verity, president of the ExxonMobil Chemical Company. “We value the government’s support and its experience in moving such a large-scale project forward.”\nThe new complex would rely on advanced proprietary technologies in direct crude steam cracking and performance polymers manufacturing. It would support progress toward China’s national petrochemical development priorities, which include self-sufficiency, diversified feedstock sources, rebalancing fuels versus chemicals and advancing new competitive technology. The framework agreement also confirms Guangdong Province’s support in progressing the Huizhou LNG receiving terminal, in which ExxonMobil intends to participate, including supply of LNG.\nThe company is also evaluating other chemicals manufacturing projects in Asia to help meet expected demand growth in the region. ExxonMobil expects to grow chemicals manufacturing capacity in Asia Pacific and North America by about 40 percent. That growth will be achieved in part by adding 13 new facilities, including two world-class steam crackers in the United States that are part of the company’s Growing the Gulf initiative. These investments would enable the company to meet increasing demand in Asia and other growing markets.\nThe company recently commenced operations at its new 1.5 million ton-per-year ethane cracker at the company’s integrated Baytown chemical and refining complex in Texas. ExxonMobil and SABIC have also created a new joint venture to advance development of the Gulf Coast Growth Ventures project, a 1.8 million tonne ethane cracker currently planned for construction in San Patricio County, Texas.

The companies’ ultimate objective is to combine Clariant’s and REG’s processes into a seamless cellulosic biomass-to-biodiesel technology.\n“Over the past three years, our work with REG has led to important advances in genetically improving REG’s proprietary microbes for a beneficial use in facilitating the conversion of cellulosic sugars into biodiesel,” said Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. “Applying Clariant’s expertise and knowledge will help us better understand and advance a key stage in the overall cellulosic conversion process, and hopefully lead to the development of scalable biodiesel technology.”\nClariant is a leading company offering integrated technologies and solutions for converting agricultural residues such as wheat straw, rice straw, corn stover and sugar cane bagasse. Clariant’s sunliquid® process features chemical-free pretreatment, the integrated production of feedstock and process-specific enzymes and thus high yields of fermentable C5 and C6 sugars. Clariant will conduct trials at its pre-commercial plant in Straubing, Germany using different types of cellulosic feedstock that will be converted into sugars for conversion by REG and ExxonMobil into high-quality, low-carbon biodiesel.\n“We are committed to innovation and R&D, together with a focus on sustainability, as main pillars of Clariant’s strategy,” said Christian Kohlpaintner, member of Clariant’s executive committee. “Our sunliquid® technology platform is a key outcome of this commitment. We are proud that two strong allies in the biofuels industry have selected Clariant as their partner and are excited to work with them on further leveraging this unique technology for converting cellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals, including biodiesel.”\nREG Life Sciences technology has proven its broad applicability to industries as diverse as flavor and fragrance, specialty chemicals and transportation fuels. Through its partnership with ExxonMobil, REG has developed proprietary technology that utilizes industrial microbes to convert complex cellulosic sugars into low-carbon biodiesel in a one-step fermentation process.\n“ExxonMobil has been an exceptional partner in developing this promising technology,” said Eric Bowen, vice president of REG Life Sciences. “We are delighted to be able to add Clariant to the team with its market leading sunliquid® technology.

Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation. “We will be a significant, long-term economic contributor to the state of New Mexico and will work hard to be a trusted member of the community.”\nThe state government will receive an estimated $62 billion in net fiscal benefits, $44 billion of which will come from new leases and royalties, according to the research. About $8.5 billion will come from state oil-and-gas severance taxes, said the study which was conducted for ExxonMobil by Impact Data Source. The research findings assume an oil price of $40 per barrel.\nFrom an employment perspective, ExxonMobil’s activities will generate an average of 4,100 direct job opportunities for New Mexicans per year for the next 40 years, the study estimates. Over the next 40 years, the company’s operations are expected to generate a total of approximately $29 billion in new wages, salaries and benefits.\nNew Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham said the industry is crucial for residents and expressed optimism about the projections.\n“The benefit to this state’s bottom line, as represented by investments from companies like ExxonMobil, has been enormous,” Gov. Lujan Grisham said. “My administration has been and will continue to be responsive to changes in the energy sector and the need for meaningful regulation and diversification as a means of ensuring a sustainable future – for our children, their education, the infrastructure that will support our collective future and more.”\nAs part of ExxonMobil’s Permian Basin growth plans, the company plans to expand its operations to produce more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day as early as 2024. This significant growth will require about $55 billion in capital expenditures in Eddy and Lea counties, providing significant economic growth benefits to the state.\nSoutheastern New Mexico communities where ExxonMobil operates will receive an estimated $1.8 billion in net tax revenue, said the Impact Data Source study.\nMore than 65 percent of those estimated tax revenues will flow to the state’s general fund.\nAt current funding levels, those contributions would translate into:\n  * $6 billion for higher education, which is enough to pay college tuition for more than 827,000 New Mexico students\n  * $10 billion for health and human services, which is equal to the salaries of more than 146,000 nurses\n  * $18 billion for New Mexico’s public schools, which is equal to the salary of more than 309,000 elementary school teachers\n  * $6 billion for other state government services, which is almost equal to the entire 2018 New Mexico state budget\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2019-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil Permian development to provide $64 billion in benefits to New Mexico: Study","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil today said a new study estimates the company’s development of Permian Basin resources in New Mexico will generate approximately $64 billion in net economic benefits for the state and local communities over the next 40 years, creating thousands of new jobs and providing increased funding for education, health and human services and infrastructure improvements.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2019\/0517_ExxonMobil-Permian-development-to-provide-64B-in-benefits-to-NM-study","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Our industry has developed high-tech advances to curb emissions, and we also hope this framework will be helpful for governments as they develop new regulations,” said Woods.\nThe ExxonMobil model framework is based on its voluntary methane reduction program, which involves prioritized replacement of components with a high-leak potential at production sites, technology enhancements to infrastructure and substantial data gathering and research. More comprehensive than current federal rules, the proposed regulations would apply to new and existing sources. The company has reduced methane emissions from its U.S. unconventional operations by 20 percent since 2016 and remains on track to reach its target of 15 percent reductions across the company.\nTo achieve meaningful reductions in methane emissions, regulations should address and include four primary requirements:\n  * Leak detection and repair programs across oil and gas infrastructure \n  * Minimization of venting \n  * Operational equipment controls\n  * Record keeping and reporting to support agency enforcement\nExxonMobil has advocated in the United States for a cost-effective, federal regulatory standard to manage methane emissions from both new and existing oil and natural gas facilities. The company will continue to work constructively with state and federal regulators, industry and nongovernmental organizations to develop and implement cost-effective and reasonable methane-emission regulations.\nExxonMobil supports the Methane Guiding Principles for reducing methane emissions across the natural gas value chain, which were signed in 2017.

Woods said the company has identified opportunities to reduce capital expenditures without compromising project advantages or returns. \n“We’ve adjusted our business plans in response to market conditions, and are working hard to en sure we maintain the value of our portfolio of industry-leading opportunities,” he said. “While these are uncertain times, some things remain unchanged – including the fundamentals that underpin our business, our long-term plan, and commitment to grow value for shareholders.” \nWoods thanked the company’s workforce for quickly adapting and adjusting manufacturing operations to deliver much-needed raw materials to assist medical professionals and first responders fighting COVID-19 on the front lines. \n“There is no question that times like these demonstrate the vital role our company and our industry play in modern life,” said Woods. “It has been inspiring to see the actions of our people who are stepping up to help fight this virus and its effects, all while continuing critical operations.” \nExxonMobil has increased production of specialty polypropylene – used to make medical gowns and masks – and isopropyl alcohol, the key ingredient in medical-grade hand sanitizer and other disinfectants.\nOperations at its Baton Rouge, LA, site were reconfigured to produce, blend, package, and distribute medical-grade hand sanitizer for donation to health care providers and first responders across the United States. And it supported development of third-party production of safety equipment that can be sterilized and worn multiple times to help alleviate shortages. \nWoods provided an overview of ExxonMobil’s performance in 2019, when the company delivered earnings of more than $14 billion, achieved first oil production in Guyana, increased Permian production volumes nearly 80 percent, and began a multi-year exploration program offshore Brazil. In the Downstream, ExxonMobil brought three major refining projects online in Antwerp, Rotterdam and Beaumont. Its chemical operations broke ground on four major projects across Baytown, Baton Rouge and Corpus Christi.\nHe also outlined ExxonMobil’s continued efforts to address society’s dual challenge of providing affordable energy necessary for economic growth while reducing emissions. The company is investing in new technologies that could provide more affordable, lower-carbon energy and has focused on three sectors – commercial transportation, power generation and industrial processes – which together account for about 80 percent of global CO2 emissions.\nIn commercial transportation, ExxonMobil is working to develop advanced biofuels from algae and cellulosic biomass. Efforts to reduce emissions in power generation and industrial involve reducing the cost of carbon capture and storage and capturing CO2 directly from ambient air.\nSince 2000, ExxonMobil has invested nearly $10 billion in projects to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions. The company also continues to expand collaborative efforts with more than 80 universities, five energy centers and multiple private sector partners around the world to explore next-generation energy technologies.\nDuring the meeting, shareholders re-elected all of the directors serving on ExxonMobil’s board, supported the company’s executive compensation program, ratified PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent auditors and supported board recommendations on six shareholder-led proposals.

E-filliates is a corporate membership program administered by the Andlinger Center and aims to help accelerate research, development and deployment of energy and environmental technologies through academia and industry partnerships.\n“We collaborate with leading universities and institutions around the world to find meaningful and scalable solutions to develop lower-emission technologies” said Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development for ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. “Our work with Princeton University’s Andlinger Center builds on decades-long interactions with the university, supporting the essential research in science, engineering and humanities needed to address national and global issues.” \n“Working with companies is a critical piece of translating fundamental knowledge and discoveries into real-world impact. We challenge ExxonMobil scientists to explore the fundamental scientific questions that underpin technology development in new ways, and they challenge our scientists to think about the practical considerations of scaling technologies,” said Yueh-Lin (Lynn) Loo, Andlinger Center director and the Theodora D. ’78 and William H. Walton ’74 Professor in Engineering. “It’s a win-win and ultimately helps us carry out a core tenet of our mission, which is to reduce emissions globally while improving access to energy around the world.”\nExxonMobil is the world-leader in carbon capture, sequestering more carbon in the last 20 years than any other company. Princeton University is advancing this technology with new research to better understand how stored CO2 flows within rocks and interacts with minerals, improving the understanding of underground storage capacity. Future CO2 storage projects can be more optimally planned and operated to achieve net emissions reductions.\nPrinceton University scientists are also working with ExxonMobil on the development of carbonate fuel cells. This is in addition to the company’s ongoing collaboration with FuelCell Energy to enhance technology for capturing CO2 from industrial facilities and electric power generation.\nOver the past five years, through the company’s participation in E-ffiliates, ExxonMobil scientists have collaborated with Princeton faculty and researchers to support early-stage research projects that are focused on identifying lower-emission technologies that can accelerate the energy transition. Results have been published in peer-reviewed journals including Nature Geoscience, Science, Applied Energy, Journal of the American Chemical Society, and Energy and Environmental Science.\nPrinceton University researchers also are working to better understand the barriers, technology needs and opportunities of the global energy transition. This research is taking a comprehensive look at potential pathways to achieve net-zero emissions in the United States by 2050, and the investments in technology, infrastructure, and skill development to achieve that goal.

Laboratory tests indicate the patent-pending membrane could be used to replace some heat-intensive distillation at refineries in the years ahead.\n  * Research published in international peer-reviewed journal, Science\nResults of the research were published today in the international peer-reviewed journal, Science.\n“Through collaboration with strong academic institutions like Georgia Tech and Imperial, we are constantly working to develop the lower-emissions energy solutions of the future,\" said Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company.\n“Inspired by reverse osmosis technology that has reduced energy intensity tenfold for water purification, we decided to look into ways to use new materials for liquids separation, which if brought to industrial scale, could significantly reduce associated greenhouse gas emissions,” said Swarup. “This is one of many new materials ExxonMobil is researching to reduce energy intensity and CO2 in our operations.”\nThe research successfully demonstrated that naphtha and kerosene—the primary components of gasoline and jet fuel—can be separated from light crude oil using pressure instead of heat, reducing emissions and energy consumption significantly compared to traditional, heat-based distillation methods.\nSince 2014, the team of scientists has worked to identify advanced membranes to separate light shale crude oil using significantly less energy than used in typical refining processes. In the gasoline and jet fuel range, the membranes developed by the team are twice as effective as the most selective commercial membranes in use today.\n“This membrane technology was developed by a diverse team of scientists and engineers using a ‘multi-scale’ approach that ranges from the molecular-scale to realistic membrane devices,” said Ryan Lively, the John H. Woody faculty fellow and associate professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering.\n“It’s rare that chemists have the chance to participate in both inventing new molecules and applying them to solve real-world problems. In this case, it really took a whole village of differing expertise to bring to fruition a new approach for separating the components of crude oil using much less energy than before,” said M.G. Finn, Chair of the School of Chemistry & Biochemistry at Georgia Tech and a joint lead of the study along with Lively.\nAdditional research and development will be needed to progress this technology to industrial scale.\n“We have the foundational experience of bringing organic solvent nanofiltration, a membrane technology becoming widely used in pharmaceuticals and chemicals industries, to market,” said Andrew Livingston, professor of chemical engineering at Imperial. “We worked extensively with ExxonMobil and Georgia Tech to demonstrate the potential scalability of this technology.”\nSince 2000, ExxonMobil has invested approximately $10 billion in projects to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions.

{"id":6983,"text":"IRVING, Texas – Scientists from ExxonMobil, University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have discovered a new material that could capture more than 90 percent of CO\nLaboratory tests indicate the patent-pending materials, known as tetraamine-functionalized metal organic frameworks, capture carbon dioxide emissions up to six times more effectively than conventional amine-based carbon capture technology. Using less energy to capture and remove carbon, the material has the potential to reduce the cost of the technology and eventually support commercial applications.\nBy manipulating the structure of the metal organic framework material, the team of scientists and students demonstrated the ability to condense a surface area the size of a football field, into just one gram of mass – about the same as a paperclip – that acts as a sponge for CO2. Results of the research were published today in the international peer-reviewed journal, Science.\n“This innovative hybrid porous material has so far proven to be more effective, requires less heating and cooling, and captures more CO2 than current materials,” said Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company.\n“Through collaborations with strong academic institutions and national labs like UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, we are developing a portfolio of lower-emissions energy solutions. This provides yet another example of one of the many new materials ExxonMobil is researching to reduce CO2 in the production of energy,” said Swarup.\nExxonMobil’s team, led by senior research associate Simon Weston, along with UC Berkeley’s professor Jeffrey Long and his team of faculty and students have been working collaboratively for eight years to develop this potential carbon capture solution that demonstrates stability in the presence of water vapor, without oxidation, allowing carbon dioxide to be captured from various sources, under a number of conditions.\nAdditional research and development will be needed to progress this technology to a larger scale pilot and ultimately to industrial scale.\nThe research successfully demonstrated that these hybrid porous metal-organic materials are highly selective and could capture more than 90 percent of the CO2 emitted from industrial sources. The materials have much greater capacity for capturing carbon dioxide and can be regenerated for repeated use by using low-temperature steam, requiring less energy for the overall carbon capture process.\n“This exciting advance for carbon capture technology is an outstanding example of how scientists with diverse expertise from universities, national labs, and industry can come together to solve fundamental research challenges,” said Jeffrey Long, professor of chemistry and chemical and biomolecular engineering at University of California, Berkeley and faculty senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “We are grateful to have had such long-term research support from ExxonMobil, without which this discovery would not have been possible. I hope this success will serve to encourage further partnerships between industry and academic research labs.”\nExxonMobil is the world leader in carbon capture, capturing more carbon dioxide than any other company since 1970 and working on a portfolio of carbon capture technologies in collaboration with others.

Natural gas realizations declined, primarily due to a lag in crude-linked LNG contract pricing.\n  * Improved market conditions enabled full recovery of production impacted by economic curtailments. Government mandated curtailments negatively impacted third quarter results and are anticipated to continue in the fourth quarter.\n Downstream\n  * Supply chain optimization, higher product sales due to increased demand, and higher marketing margins more than offset lower industry fuels margins driven by market oversupply and high product inventory levels.\n  * Third quarter saw the best reliability and process performance in the last 10 years, while average refinery utilization increased about 6 percent from the second quarter on demand recovery. Refining capacity sparing decreased to about 25 percent.\n Chemical\n  * Chemical sales volumes were higher than second quarter, benefiting from resilient packaging demand and recovering automotive and construction markets. Chemical margins were negatively impacted by higher feed costs.\n  * The company's Corpus Christi chemical complex joint venture is approximately 80 percent complete, with start-up activities expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n Strengthening the Portfolio\n  * ExxonMobil announced that it has funded the Payara development offshore Guyana, following government and regulatory approvals. The third major project in the Stabroek Block will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day after expected startup in 2024. The company also made its 17th and 18th discoveries at the Yellowtail-2 and Redtail-1 wells, respectively, increasing the estimated recoverable resource to nearly 9 billion oil-equivalent barrels on the Stabroek block.\n  * During the quarter, production volumes in the Permian averaged 401,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day which included full recovery of volumes curtailed in the prior quarter. Full year 2020 production is anticipated to be approximately 360,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day. Focus remains on lowering overall development costs through efficiency gains and technology applications. Compared to 2019, drilling and completion costs decreased more than 20 percent, while drilling rates (lateral feet per day) and fracturing rates (stages per day) both increased more than 30 percent. Rig count reductions continue, with 10-15 rigs expected to be operating by year-end.\n  * ExxonMobil continues to improve its industry-leading development opportunities, as illustrated by the growth of the recoverable resource base in Guyana to nearly 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and other high-value assets in the U.S. Permian Basin, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Brazil. Given the high quality opportunities in ExxonMobil's portfolio and the constraints of the current market environment, the corporation is assessing its full portfolio to prioritize assets with the highest value potential within its broad range of available opportunities. This effort includes an ongoing re-assessment of North American dry gas assets currently included in the corporation’s development plan. Depending on the outcome of the planning process, including in particular any significant future changes to the corporation’s current development plans for its dry gas portfolio, long-lived assets with carrying values of approximately $25 billion to $30 billion could be at risk for significant impairment. If these assets remain in our long-term development plan, similar to previous years, it is unlikely the assets would be subject to material impairment. The company expects to complete this assessment in the fourth quarter.\n Disciplined Investing and Cost Management\n  * ExxonMobil made significant progress during the quarter on previously announced capital and cash operating expense reductions. Planned reductions to the 2020 capital spending program, from $33 billion to $23 billion, are ahead of schedule, reflecting increased efficiencies, lower market prices, and slower project pace. An expected decrease in cash operating expenses of about 15 percent is also ahead of schedule, capturing savings from increased efficiencies, reduced activity, and lower energy costs and volumes. \n Advancing Innovative Technologies and Products\n  * The company continued to progress work on scaling carbon-capture technologies aimed at reducing emissions. Following 12 months of technical evaluation, ExxonMobil and Global Thermostat announced an expanded joint development agreement to advance and bring to scale breakthrough technology that removes carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. ExxonMobil also announced, in collaboration with the University of California, Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the discovery of a new material that could capture more than 90 percent of carbon dioxide from industrial sources, such as natural gas-fired power plants. \n  * ExxonMobil built on the company's longstanding efforts to develop and deliver products that help meet society's energy needs while reducing environmental impacts. These efforts included an agreement with Global Clean Energy Holdings to purchase 2.5 million barrels of renewable diesel per year for five years from a Bakersfield, CA biorefinery starting in 2022. Based on analysis of California Air Resources Board (CARB) data, renewable diesel from various non-petroleum feedstocks can provide life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions of approximately 40 percent to 80 percent compared to petroleum-based diesel.\n First Nine Months 2020 Financial Updates\nDuring the first nine months of 2020, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 6 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $305 million. These shares were acquired to offset dilution in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. The corporation will continue to acquire shares to offset dilution in conjunction with its benefit plans and programs.  \n  \nExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters during a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on October 30, 2020.

{"id":7010,"text":"\nIRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil said today it has created a new business to commercialize its extensive low-carbon technology portfolio. The new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, will initially focus on carbon capture and storage, one of the critical technologies required to achieve net zero emissions and the climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. \n  * New business to commercialize and deploy technology from extensive, industry-leading R&D portfolio \n  * Initial focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology recognized as critical to achieving Paris Agreement climate goals\n  * Advancing plans for over 20 new CCS opportunities to enable large-scale emission reductions \nExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions is advancing plans for more than 20 new carbon capture and storage opportunities around the world to enable large-scale emission reductions. ExxonMobil plans to invest $3 billion on lower emission energy solutions through 2025. The business will be led by Joe Blommaert, who has more than 30 years of experience in the industry with leadership roles in technology advancement, product marketing, and operations. The board of directors has elected him as a vice president of Exxon Mobil Corporation.  \n  \nCCS is the process of capturing CO2 that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere from industrial activity, and injecting it into deep geologic formations for safe, secure and permanent storage. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency agree that CCS is one of the most important low-carbon technologies required to achieve societal climate goals at the lowest cost. CCS is also one of the only technologies that could enable some industry sectors to decarbonize, including the refining, chemicals, cement and steel sectors.  \n  \nExxonMobil has more than 30 years of experience in CCS technology and was the first company to capture more than 120 million tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to the emissions of more than 25 million cars for one year. The company has an equity share in about one-fifth of global CO2 capture capacity and has captured approximately 40 percent of all the captured anthropogenic CO2 in the world.  \n  \nExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions will also leverage ExxonMobil’s significant experience in the production of hydrogen which, when coupled with CCS, is likely to play a critical role in a lower-carbon energy system. Other technology focus areas in ExxonMobil’s low carbon portfolio will be added in the future as they mature to commercialization.   \n  \n“With our demonstrated leadership in carbon capture and emissions reduction technologies, ExxonMobil is committed to meeting the demand for affordable energy while reducing emissions and managing the risks of climate change,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “We are focused on proprietary projects and commercial partnerships that will have a demonstrably positive impact on our own emissions as well as those from the industrial, power generation and commercial transportation sectors, which together account for 80 percent of global CO2 emissions. We have the expertise that can help bring technologies to market and make a meaningful difference.”  \n  \nThe business will seek to develop partnerships and collaborations on a wide range of technologies, and be responsible for marketing of emission-reduction credits created through the business’s sequestration projects.   \n  \nNew CCS projects and partnerships under evaluation include:\n  * U.S. Gulf Coast – ExxonMobil is assessing multiple CCS projects along the U.S. Gulf Coast that have the potential to collect millions of tonnes of CO2 from industrial sources for storage in onshore and offshore geologic formations. Included in these projects is a CCS hub concept in Southeast Texas. \n  * Wyoming, USA – ExxonMobil has progressed permitting for the expansion of its La Barge CCS facilities, which could enable an additional one million tonnes of CO2 per year to be captured. Existing facilities currently capture approximately 7 million tonnes per year, which is the largest amount of CO2 captured by any industrial facility in the world. \n  * Netherlands – ExxonMobil has executed a joint development agreement to advance its interest in the Port of Rotterdam CO2 Transportation Hub and Offshore Storage project, known as Porthos. The Porthos project aims to collect CO2 emissions from industrial sources and transport them by pipeline to depleted North Sea offshore gas fields. Porthos and its potential customers have applied for EU and national support mechanisms. ExxonMobil also participates in the H-Vision study into large-scale production of low-carbon hydrogen in Rotterdam.\n  * Belgium – ExxonMobil is participating in the multi-stakeholder CCS project at the Port of Antwerp, Europe’s largest integrated energy and chemicals cluster. The project, which would collect CO2 emissions from industrial sources for storage, recently applied for support from the European Union.\n  * Scotland – Through its joint venture in the SEGAL system in Northeast Scotland, ExxonMobil is progressing discussions to support the Acorn project, which will collect CO2 from the St. Fergus gas processing complex for transport and storage in offshore gas reservoirs. \n  * Singapore – ExxonMobil is planning a CCS hub concept to capture, transport and permanently store CO2 generated by industrial activity in the Asia-Pacific region. The project concept is based on a plan to capture CO2 emissions from Singapore manufacturing facilities for storage in the region.\n  * Qatar \\- ExxonMobil is a partner in several existing joint ventures with Qatar Petroleum that operate a CCS project with an annual capacity of 2.1 million tonnes at Ras Laffan. ExxonMobil is evaluating opportunities to add additional capture capacity in the region.\nThe new projects will complement ExxonMobil’s current carbon capture capacity in the United States, Australia and Qatar, which totals about 9 million tonnes per year, the equivalent of planting 150 million trees every year.  \n  \nExxonMobil is collaborating with multiple partners across industry, academia and government to advance carbon capture technologies to reduce costs and enhance scalability. This includes the company’s work with FuelCell Energy to advance carbonate fuel cell technology to more efficiently capture CO2 from industrial facilities, and Global Thermostat, a collaboration to advance efforts to capture CO2 directly from the air.   \n  \nCCS opportunities can become more commercially attractive through government policy, including the United States tax credit 45Q, which ExxonMobil supports, and other supportive policies in the European Union, Canada and Singapore.  \n  \nSince 2000, ExxonMobil has spent more than $10 billion to develop and deploy higher-efficiency and lower-emission energy solutions across its operations. The company works with about 80 universities in the United States, Europe and Asia to explore next-generation energy technologies.   \n  \n    \n  \n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2021-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions to commercialize emission-reduction technology","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"\n\nIRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil said today it has created a new business to commercialize its extensive low-carbon technology portfolio.

{"id":7023,"text":"IRVING, Texas \/ STUTTGART, Germany – ExxonMobil and Porsche are testing advanced biofuels and renewable, lower-carbon eFuels, as part of a new agreement to find pathways toward potential future consumer adoption. \n  * Esso Renewable Racing Fuel to be tested in Porsche’s high-performance motorsports engines in the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup 2021\n  * Companies to advance eFuel development with potential for greenhouse gas reduction\n  * eFuels to be produced using hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide \n  * New agreement builds on 25-year relationship of developing and testing high-performance products \nThe first iteration of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel is a blend of primarily advanced biofuels and is specially formulated by ExxonMobil’s in-house team of scientists and engineers. Analysis indicates the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a liquid fuel. The fuel will be tested in race conditions with Porsche’s high-performance motorsports engines during the 2021 Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup race series.   \n  \nPorsche and ExxonMobil’s collaboration will also focus on eFuels, which are synthetic fuels made from hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide. As early as 2022, the companies plan to test the second iteration of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel, which will contain eFuel components. The eFuel is anticipated to achieve a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of up to 85 percent, when blended to current market fuel standards for today’s passenger vehicles.i  \n  \n“The electrification of our vehicles is of highest priority to us,” said Michael Steiner, Member of the Executive Board, Research and Development of Porsche. “eFuels are a good complement to our powertrain strategy. They allow our customers to drive cars with conventional combustion engines as well as plug-in hybrids with significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions. The collaboration with ExxonMobil enables us to test the eFuels under demanding conditions on the racing track. This is a further step towards making eFuels an affordable and lower greenhouse gas emission substitute to conventional fuels.”  \n  \nThe eFuel will be sourced from the Haru Oni pilot plant based in Chile that generates hydrogen, which is then combined with captured carbon dioxide drawn from the atmosphere to produce methanol. ExxonMobil is providing a license and support for the proprietary technology to convert the methanol to gasoline, which will result in a lower-carbon fuel.   \n  \nIn the pilot phase, around 35,000 gallons of eFuels will be produced in 2022. As the fuel’s primary user, Porsche will use the eFuels from Chile among others in the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup starting in the season of 2022.  \n  \n“Over the past quarter century, we have worked together with Porsche to develop high-performance products that support Porsche’s vehicle performance on the racetrack and on the road,” said Andy Madden, vice president of strategy and planning for ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants. “Our continued collaboration on renewable and eFuels is a critical step in assessing the technical capability and commercial viability of fuels that can significantly reduce emissions.”  \n  \nThe first on-track testing of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel is scheduled for March 30, 2021 in Zandvoort, Netherlands, and will continue throughout the 2021 and 2022 Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup race series.   \n  \nThe collaboration with Porsche builds on ExxonMobil’s continuing efforts to develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions, including high-efficiency fuels and lubricants, advanced plastics and other products that can enable cars and trucks to use less fuel. For example, the two companies have collaborated on a line of specially formulated lubricants for the electric vehicles market, Mobil EVTM range.  \n  \nIn January, ExxonMobil announced the creation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, to commercialize its extensive low-carbon technology portfolio and plans to invest $3 billion on lower emission energy solutions through 2025. Last year, ExxonMobil announced plans to distribute renewable diesel within California and potentially other domestic and international markets as soon as 2022.   \n  \nOver the past two decades, ExxonMobil has invested more than $10 billion to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions, resulting in highly efficient operations that have eliminated or avoided approximately 480 million tonnes of CO2 emissions - the equivalent of taking more than 100 million passenger vehicles off the road for a year.ii  \n  \nPorsche is committed to invest $17.9 billion in electromobility and digitalization by 2025.

{"id":7029,"text":"IRVING, Texas – April 30, 2021 – Exxon Mobil Corporation today announced estimated first quarter 2021 earnings of $2.7 billion, or $0.64 per share assuming dilution, compared with a loss of $610 million in the first quarter of 2020. Results included unfavorable identified items of $31 million, or $0.01 per share assuming dilution. First quarter capital and exploration expenditures were $3.1 billion, $4 billion lower than the first quarter of 2020.\nFirst Quarter 2021 Results and Management Perspectives \n  * Cash flow from operating activities of $9.3 billion fully funded dividend and capital expenditures, and drove debt reduction of over $4 billion \n  * Lowered cash operating expenses versus the first and fourth quarters of 2020; on pace to deliver additional structural cost savings \n  * Advanced several initiatives to reduce emissions and launched Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize extensive low-carbon technology portfolio \n  * Added three new directors to strengthen board experience in energy, capital allocation and complex business transitions\nOil-equivalent production was 3.8 million barrels per day, up 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding entitlement effects, government mandates and divestments, oil-equivalent production was up 2 percent. \n“The strong first quarter results reflect the benefits of higher commodity prices and our focus on structural cost reductions, while prioritizing investments in assets with a low cost of supply,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter fully covered the dividend and capital investments, and we strengthened the balance sheet by reducing debt. We also made progress on our energy transition strategy by launching our new ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business, which is initially working to develop innovative, large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) concepts, including the evaluation and advancement of more than 20 new opportunities, such as a multi-industry hub to reduce emissions from hard-to-decarbonize industries near the Houston Ship Channel. As the global leader in carbon capture, we are seeing growing public and private sector support for CCS as a critical enabling technology to reduce emissions and help meet society's net-zero ambitions.” \nDuring severe winter weather in Texas in February, ExxonMobil cogeneration facilities generated 400 megawatts of electricity, helping to power about 200,000 homes. The severe weather event reduced first quarter earnings by nearly $600 million across all businesses from decreased production and lower sales volumes, repair costs, and the net impact of energy purchases and sales. All affected facilities have resumed normal operations.\n First Quarter 2021 Results and Business Highlights\n Upstream\n  * Average realizations for crude oil increased 42 percent from the fourth quarter. Natural gas realizations rose by 33 percent in the quarter.\n  * Total production volumes increased 98,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day from the fourth quarter. Excluding entitlement effects, government mandates and divestments, liquids volumes were down 3 percent including impacts from higher maintenance and the winter storm. Natural gas volumes increased 12 percent driven by higher seasonal demand in Europe. \n  * During the quarter, production volumes in the Permian averaged 394,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 12 percent from the prior year. The focus remains on continuing to grow positive free cash flow by lowering overall development costs and increasing recovery through efficiency gains and technology applications.\n Downstream \n  * Industry fuels margins improved from the fourth quarter, but remained below 10-year-lows driven by market oversupply and high product inventory levels. Lubricants delivered strong performance, underpinned by lower costs and improved margins. \n  * Despite winter storm disruptions, overall refining throughput was essentially flat with the fourth quarter as the company managed refinery operations in line with fuel demand and integrated chemical manufacturing needs. \n Chemical \n  * Industry margins improved further in the quarter reflecting continued strong demand, global shipping constraints, and ongoing supply disruptions, particularly in North America, where the polyethylene and polypropylene markets were affected by severe winter weather in Texas. \n  * Strong first quarter Chemical earnings performance of $1.4 billion was supported by robust base operations capturing high margins and continued delivery of cost efficiencies. \n  * ExxonMobil announced it is pursuing three new advanced recycling initiatives in the U.S. and Europe that further advance our commitment to sustainability and capture value from plastic waste at scale. The company plans to begin marketing certified circular plastics products later this year. \n Strengthening the Portfolio\n  * ExxonMobil signed an agreement valued at more than $1 billion for the sale of most of its non-operated upstream assets in the United Kingdom central and northern North Sea. The sale price, subject to closing adjustments, has potential additional upside of up to $300 million based on contingent payments associated with future commodity price increases. The transaction is expected to close near mid-year 2021, subject to regulatory and third-party approvals. \n  * The company is progressing plans to convert both its Altona, Australia refinery, and Slagen refinery in Norway to fuel import terminals, ensuring ongoing, reliable fuel supply for their respective local markets. Final decisions were made following local consultation processes with employees and their representatives as part of extensive reviews of the long-term economic viability of both facilities. \n Capital Allocation and Structural Cost Improvement \n  * The company's long-term capital allocation priorities remain investing in advantaged projects to drive cash flow, strengthening the balance sheet and maintaining a reliable dividend. \n  * ExxonMobil’s 2021 capital program remains at $16 billion to $19 billion. If market conditions continue above the company's planning basis, additional cash will be used to accelerate deleveraging. \n  * In addition to $3 billion in structural cost reductions already achieved in 2020, the company is on pace to achieve $3 billion of further structural efficiencies through 2023 for a total of $6 billion relative to 2019. Efforts to identify additional structural savings resulting from the reorganizations completed in 2019 are continuing. \n Reducing Emissions and Advancing Low Carbon Solutions \n  * The company announced the creation of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, a new business to commercialize its extensive low-carbon technology portfolio, with an initial focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS), the process of sequestering industrial emissions and safely storing them permanently underground. CCS is considered one of the critical technologies required to achieve society’s net-zero ambitions and the climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. \n  * In April, ExxonMobil introduced the innovative concept of a multi-industry CCS hub along the Houston Ship Channel and surrounding industrial areas to capture CO2 emissions from area industry, including petrochemical, manufacturing and power generation facilities. The concept would require large-scale collaboration and policy advancements among governments, private industry, and local communities. \n  * ExxonMobil became the first company to file an application with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use new aerial technologies to detect methane emissions at oil and natural gas sites. \n  * ExxonMobil and Porsche are testing advanced biofuels and renewable, lower-carbon eFuels, as part of a new agreement to find pathways toward potential future consumer adoption of fuels that could significantly reduce emissions. \n Ongoing Board Refreshment\n  * During the quarter, ExxonMobil announced the elections of Michael Angelakis, Jeffrey Ubben, and Wan Zulkiflee to its board of directors. With the addition of the new members, the ExxonMobil board increased to 13 directors, 12 of whom are independent. The company has added six new independent directors since 2017 with specific experience in the areas of climate science, asset and risk management, capital allocation, energy and business transition, investor perspectives, and additional energy industry experience. \nExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters during a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on April 30, 2021.

{"id":7050,"text":"IRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil has increased its participation in the proposed Acorn carbon capture project in Scotland by signing an Expression of Interest to capture, transport and store CO\n  * Expression of Interest signed to study storing emissions from Fife Ethylene Plant to Acorn carbon capture and storage project\n  * Adds to previously announced study focused on emissions from St Fergus gas terminals\n  * Project would capture, transport and store CO2 in secure reservoirs beneath the North Sea \nThe agreement to include the ethylene plant, located in Mossmorran, Scotland, is in addition to an earlier announced Memorandum of Understanding to capture and store emissions from gas terminals at the St Fergus complex at Peterhead, Scotland, which includes ExxonMobil’s joint venture gas terminal.\nThe initial phase of Acorn, which is bidding to be in the first wave of carbon capture clusters to be announced by the UK government, has the potential to deliver more than half of the country’s target of capturing and storing 10 million metric tons per year of CO2 by 2030. When expanded further, it will have the potential to store more than 20 million metric tons per year of CO2 by the mid-2030s.\n“The application of carbon capture and storage technology at the Fife Ethylene Plant demonstrates our commitment to reducing CO2 emissions from the industrial sector,” said Joe Blommaert, president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. “With the right government policies in place and industry collaboration, the carbon capture and storage opportunities we are evaluating, such as in Scotland, have the potential to move forward with current technologies for large-scale, game-changing emissions reductions.”\nThe Acorn project recently announced plans to capture and store CO2 from the Grangemouth Refinery, and the addition of Mossmorran facilities will help Scotland reduce emissions in its industrial sector.\n“The Acorn project has the potential to capture and store CO2 emissions from Scotland’s largest industrial center, which is an economic engine for the country,” said Martin Burrell, plant manager of the Fife Ethylene Plant. “This agreement allows us to explore the potential for significant emissions reduction through carbon capture and storage, and ensure Scotland continues to benefit from vital manufacturing facilities such as Fife.”\nThe Fife Ethylene Plant recently completed a $170 million (£140 million) investment program to upgrade key infrastructure and introduce new technologies that will significantly improve operational reliability and performance. A further project is underway to install an enclosed ground flare. On schedule to be operational by the end of 2022, the unit is designed to significantly reduce noise, light and vibration, and it is estimated the investment will reduce the use of the plant’s elevated flare by at least 98 percent.\nThese investments, together with ExxonMobil’s participation in the Acorn project, demonstrate a commitment to reducing emissions and to Fife’s future as a competitive asset.\nExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions is evaluating several other carbon capture and storage projects around the world, including in Rotterdam, Netherlands; Normandy, France; LaBarge, Wyoming; and a world-scale carbon capture and storage hub concept in Houston, Texas. The company has an equity share in approximately one-fifth of global CO2 capture capacity and has captured approximately 40 percent of all the captured anthropogenic CO2 in the world. \nExxonMobil established its Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize low-emission technologies. It is initially focusing its carbon capture efforts on point source emissions, the process of capturing CO2 from industrial activity that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, and injecting it into deep underground geologic formations for safe, secure and permanent storage. The business is also pursuing strategic investments in biofuels and hydrogen to bring those lower-emissions energy technologies to scale for hard-to-decarbonize sectors of the global economy.\nThe International Energy Agency projects that carbon capture and storage could mitigate up to 15% of global emissions by 2040, and the U.N.

{"id":7053,"text":"Today, ExxonMobil held an employee forum at its campus in Houston. Chairman and CEO Darren Woods discussed the current state of the industry, how the company managed through a difficult period, the leadership role the company intends to play in the energy transition, and his optimism for the future. Mr. Woods’ comments to ExxonMobil’s employees are summarized as follows:\n Unprecedented times\nI'd like to start by simply thanking you. You’ve shown tremendous resilience and professionalism over the past few years as we've dealt with the pandemic. These times have been truly unprecedented for the world, for our industry, and for our company.\nBeyond the pandemic, we've faced global concerns about climate change and tremendous turbulence in politics and society around the world. Today, I hope to convey to you why I'm so excited about the future. We can't forget that with unprecedented times comes unprecedented opportunity.\n Improving conditions\nBusiness conditions are improving as the pandemic's impact continues to subside. Global economies are rebounding as vaccination rates rise and infection rates fall. People are returning to work. Personal and business travel is resuming. \nThe rebound is stressing supplies of oil, gas and chemical products around the world. As a result, prices and margins are rising, improving revenue that we're using to strengthen our balance sheet, fund our capital program and pay the dividend. While the past two years were tough, they laid the groundwork for today's market and helped accelerate improvements in our businesses. Today, we're seeing the benefits of investments we made at the bottom of the commodity cycle, when many of our competitors pulled back.\n Meeting society’s needs\nOur focus, which I’ve been proud to be part of since joining ExxonMobil almost three decades ago, takes advantage of our company’s history, experience and capabilities. It is based on a noble, worthy contribution which we are uniquely suited for, and that is helping advance growth in global prosperity through innovative solutions that meet society’s greatest needs.\n Objectives of our strategy\nTo accomplish this mission, we've set three high-level objectives:\n  * Reliably supply the world with products essential for modern living;\n  * Grow earnings and cash flow faster than our competition; and\n  * Lead industry in helping fulfill society's ambition for a lower carbon future.\n Three strategic priorities\nTo meet these objectives, we focused on three key priorities:\n  * Fully leveraging our corporate competitive advantages;\n  * Delivering industry-leading financial and operating performance; and\n  * Leading industry in hard-to-decarbonize emissions reductions.\n Evolving our operating model\nA first step was better organizing our businesses to improve visibility and accountability across value chains in order to improve decision making, speed, and end-to-end ownership of results. \nThis led to the consolidation of our functional companies and created value chains: Upstream was organized along resource types; Chemicals along global product lines; Downstream along tributary fuels markets and integrated lubricants basestocks with finished products. Now, with the addition of the Low Carbon Solutions unit, we have three fundamental business groups — one to discover, develop and produce hydrocarbons; one to convert them into needed products; and one to manage emissions.\nWe're in a much stronger position now to realize the benefits of the economic recovery, capitalize on market improvements, and capture future opportunities. We're also better positioned to apply our corporate competitive advantages and the outstanding talents of our people.\n Reliably supplying the world\nOur businesses continue to lead the way in supplying the world with the products essential for modern living.\nOur Upstream business continues to improve the portfolio and is on track for the best cash flow performance in the industry by 2025. We've had outstanding success with discoveries in Guyana and increased the total estimated recoverable resource on the Stabroek block to approximately 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels. \nOur Downstream business is steadily improving with a slow return to pre-Covid markets. Our past efforts to increase efficiency are now helping improve our margins as the industry rebounds. We continue to lead the industry with the lowest GHG intensity and are increasing investments in low-emission fuels.\nAnd our Chemicals business is on pace for record earnings this year after contributing $2.3 billion in the second quarter alone. Our strategy to focus on performance products and lead in each product category continues to pay off.\nWe are delivering excellent progress and performance in each of our businesses, and we are stronger today than ever.\n Improving financial position – Growing earnings and cash flow\nAt our Investor Day earlier this year, we provided a roadmap for improved earnings and cash flow to 2025. Our plan called for improved margins, operating expenses, and other factors that could position us to significantly rebound and regain industry-leading financial performance.\nThrough the end of the second-quarter, our earnings and cash flow improvements were well on track. We'll report our third-quarter results next week, and, as indicated in our Sept. 30 8-K filing, we expect the market improvement to impact those results. We're in good shape to meet our 2021 plans, which also keeps us on the path to achieving the goals we laid out at Investor Day.\n Leading in a lower carbon future\nWe seek to be a leader when it comes to helping society achieve its lower-carbon ambitions. We started laying groundwork for this in 2017. We built up our R&D capabilities and expanded external collaborations on technology solutions.\nWe plan to succeed in this area by applying our technology, partnering with stakeholders across the world to scale and operationalize Low Carbon Solutions projects, and advocating for market-based policies that support a lower-carbon world.\nWe are making tremendous progress. The Houston carbon capture and storage (CCS) hub announced in April has gained widespread support. Eleven companies are now coming together to advance large-scale CCS technology in the Houston area, which is one of the most concentrated sources of CO2 in the U.S. These companies account for more than 70% of the emissions in that region, so it's a very important grouping of interested parties that could make a significant difference in that region.\nWe're making solid progress with our European CCS projects, and we're seeing real opportunities for new CCS projects in Asia, which we expect to announce in the near future. \n Advocating for effective policies\nWhile we prefer policymakers adopt a transparent, economy-wide price on carbon in the form of a carbon tax, we recognize it is politically challenged. However, we are seeing growing, positive interest for specific sectoral policies to reduce emissions and make CCS more economic including carbon-intensity based standards for transportation fuels and the power sector.\nBeyond CCS, we've been a leader in advocating for comprehensive federal methane regulations, and we are pleased that policymakers are increasingly making this a key part of their emission-reduction plans.\n The next 135 years\nOver our 135-year history, we’ve always demonstrated a way to evolve and adapt to meet the needs of society, and I've never been more excited about our opportunity to lead and grow. We have the core technology capabilities to discover, produce, convert and manage hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based solutions. \nWe’ve never been more prepared to deliver the products and solutions that society needs for modern living, in addition to supporting the desire for a lower-carbon future.\nI'm proud of the work that all of you have done to overcome the challenges of the past few years. \nWe still have work to do, though we have turned the corner and are on the right track to regain industry-leading performance. As we have done so many times before, we’ve found our path to leadership and created the opportunity for ExxonMobil to thrive for the next 135 years.\nThank you.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2021-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods hosts global employee forum","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"Today, ExxonMobil held an employee forum at its campus in Houston.

Southampton has one of the largest industrial sectors in the United Kingdom, and is both a critical element of the country’s energy supply chain and an important gateway for trade in global markets.\n  * Study estimates that carbon capture facilities could initially capture approximately 2 million tonnes of CO2 per year\n  * If technical and business feasibility is confirmed, and with the right Government support, hydrogen production could commence as early as 2030\nAn initial feasibility study by SGN and GIG shows the annual hydrogen demand from the cluster, which is home to ExxonMobil’s Fawley complex, could rise to as much as 37 TWh by 2050, including the heating demand of 800,000 homes across the South of England. An increase in the use of hydrogen with carbon capture would help reduce emissions in the area’s industrial sector and stimulate the local economy through the conversion of the natural gas network, while helping reduce emissions from domestic heating and transport.\nThe feasibility study estimated that carbon capture facilities could initially capture approximately 2 million tonnes of CO2 per year, including from initial hydrogen production of around 4.3 TWh of hydrogen per year. This could also attract significant investment in the community, support existing employment and stimulate the creation of local jobs. If technical and business feasibility is confirmed, and with the right Government support, hydrogen production could commence as early as 2030.\nAngus McIntosh, Director of Energy Futures at SGN said: “Hydrogen will be key in our journey to net zero, providing a reliable, affordable and practical supply of clean energy to multiple sectors whilst ensuring security of supply. The creation of hydrogen hubs in and around industry is a great way of achieving scaled hydrogen demand and creating hydrogen economies. We are pleased to partner in this project to explore decarbonisation of the Solent area and build on the outputs of the feasibility study. This project can kick start a net zero industrial cluster in Southampton and stimulate net zero gas networks across the South of England.”\nEdward Northam, head of GIG Europe said: “Hydrogen will play a vital role in decarbonising industrial clusters like Southampton, and so it is extremely positive that our recent exploratory study has concluded that this hydrogen project is both technologically and economically feasible. Getting the project to development will require close partnership with local industry – which is why ExxonMobil, a potential cornerstone producer and user of hydrogen, joining our project is a significant step forward.”\nJoe Blommaert, president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions said: “Hydrogen has the potential to help provide customers with access to affordable, reliable energy while minimising emissions. We are pleased to be part of this collaboration that includes a technical study to assess the potential for the Fawley facility to play a key role in both hydrogen production and carbon capture and storage solutions.

{"id":7071,"text":"IRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil today announced its ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions for operated assets by 2050, backed by a comprehensive approach to develop detailed emission-reduction roadmaps for major facilities and assets.\n  * Comprehensive approach centered on detailed Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission-reduction roadmaps for major operated assets \n  * Ambition supported by 2030 emission-reduction plans, including net-zero plans for Permian Basin operations\n  * Company strategy tested for resiliency against a range of net-zero scenarios, including IPCC and IEA\nThe net-zero ambition is contained in the company’s Advancing Climate Solutions - 2022 Progress Report, formerly known as the Energy & Carbon Summary. The net-zero aspiration applies to Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and builds on ExxonMobil’s 2030 emission-reduction plans, which include net-zero emissions for Permian Basin operations and ongoing investments in lower-emission solutions in which it has extensive experience, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels.\n“ExxonMobil is committed to playing a leading role in the energy transition, and Advancing Climate Solutions articulates our deliberate approach to helping society reach a lower-emissions future,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “We are developing comprehensive roadmaps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our operated assets around the world, and where we are not the operator, we are working with our partners to achieve similar emission-reduction results.” \nThe report provides details of how ExxonMobil’s business strategy is resilient when tested against a range of Paris-aligned net-zero scenarios, including the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2018 Special Report and the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero by 2050 scenario. \nExxonMobil’s Outlook for Energy, which is based on current policy and technology trends, continues to be the basis for the company’s business plans and investment decisions. In the Advancing Climate Solutions report, the company outlines how its short- and medium-term business plans are adjustable to developments in policy and technology and how it uses signposts and leading indicators to evaluate the need for any changes in future years.\nSound government policies will accelerate the deployment of key technologies at the pace and scale required to support a net-zero future. ExxonMobil continues to support an explicit price on carbon to establish market incentives and encourage investments in lower-emissions technologies.\nExxonMobil is also committed to helping customers reduce their greenhouse emissions by investing in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. Bio-based feed and plastic waste streams provide further opportunities for lowering greenhouse gas emissions.\n“As we invest in these important technologies, we will advocate for well-designed, high-impact policies that can accelerate the deployment of market-based, cost-effective solutions,” said Woods. “We believe our strategy is unique among industry and enables us to succeed across multiple scenarios. We will create shareholder value by adjusting investments between our existing low-cost portfolio and new lower-emission business opportunities to match the pace of the energy transition.”\nTo help reach net zero for operated assets by 2050, the company has identified more than 150 potential steps and modifications that can be applied to assets in its upstream, downstream and chemical operations. \nInitial actions already underway prioritize energy efficiency measures, methane mitigation, equipment upgrades and the elimination of venting and routine flaring. Further high-impact reduction opportunities include power and steam co-generation and electrification of operations, using renewable or lower-emission power. The company expects to finalize detailed roadmaps that address approximately 90% of operations-related greenhouse gas emissions by the end of this year, and the remainder will be completed in 2023.\nInitial steps to achieve net zero by 2050 are included in the company’s plans to invest more than $15 billion by 2027 on lower-emission initiatives. Policies further accelerating the development and deployment of lower-emission technologies could provide ExxonMobil with additional investment opportunities.\nAdvancing Climate Solutions - 2022 Progress Report is available online at exxonmobil.com. The report expands on the company’s 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, which are consistent with Paris-aligned pathways, the U.S. and European Union’s Global Methane Pledge and the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. Compared to emission levels in 2016, the time of the Paris Agreement, the 2030 plans include a 20-30% reduction in corporate-wide greenhouse gas intensity, which includes 40-50% reduction in upstream greenhouse gas intensity, 70-80% reduction in corporate-wide methane intensity, and 60-70% reduction in corporate-wide flaring intensity.\nThe 2030 emission-reduction plans are expected to achieve World Bank Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 and reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 30% for the company’s upstream business and 20% for the entire corporation. Similarly, absolute flaring and methane emissions are expected to decrease by 60% and 70%, respectively by 2030. \nExxonMobil has regularly updated emission-reduction plans as technologies and policies have evolved and will continue to do so. When final data is collected and analyzed, the company expects to report it achieved its 2025 emission-reduction plans as of year-end 2021, including a 15-20% reduction in greenhouse gas intensity for its upstream operations, compared to 2016 levels.\nExxonMobil’s strategy is outlined in Advancing Climate Solutions and leverages its advantages in scale, integration, technology and people to build globally competitive businesses that lead industry in earnings and cash flow growth across a broad range of future scenarios.\n\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2022-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil announces ambition for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil today announced its ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions for operated assets by 2050, backed by a comprehensive approach to develop detailed emission-reduction roadmaps for major facilities and assets.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2022\/0118_ExxonMobil-announces-ambition-for-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2050","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Pending regulatory approvals, startup is estimated in 2025.\nThe expansion is part of the company’s 2030 emission-reduction plans and supports the company’s ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) for its operated assets by 2050. By capturing an additional 1.2 million metric tons of CO2 each year, ExxonMobil can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its upstream operated emissions by 3%. The LaBarge facility currently captures nearly 20% of all human-made CO2 captured in the world each year.\n“Our state has always been a leader in carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS) and we are pleased to see projects like this that bring that technology forward. Wyoming and our industries do more than talk about carbon capture technologies. We help develop and deploy them,” said Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon. “This announcement is a great example of what industry can do to reduce greenhouse emissions and develop resources. I am delighted that ExxonMobil has decided to move forward with their expansion in Wyoming. This helps Wyoming advance its commitment to develop the technology to become carbon negative.”\nIn addition to producing natural gas, ExxonMobil’s LaBarge facility is one of the world’s largest sources of helium, producing approximately 20% of global supply. Helium is an essential component for health care equipment such as magnetic resonance imaging, high-tech products including fiber optics and semiconductors, and materials for space travel.\nExxonMobil established its Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize low-emission technologies. It is initially focusing on carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels – technologies where the company can leverage its core competencies and competitive advantages. Over the next six years, the company plans to invest more than $15 billion on lower-emission initiatives.\nSound government policies will accelerate the deployment of key technologies at the pace and scale required to support a societal net-zero future.\nExxonMobil has more than 30 years of experience capturing CO2 and has cumulatively captured more anthropogenic CO2 than any other company.

{"id":7083,"text":"IRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil said today it is planning a hydrogen production plant and one of the world’s largest carbon capture and storage projects at its integrated refining and petrochemical site at Baytown, Texas, supporting efforts to reduce emissions from company operations and local industry.\n  * Hydrogen would fuel olefins plant, reduce integrated site emissions by up to 30% \n  * Carbon capture project would be one of world’s largest; double company’s industry-leading capacity \n  * Hydrogen and carbon capture capacity to help industry reduce emissions \n“Hydrogen has the potential to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in vital sectors of the economy and create valuable, lower-emissions products that support modern life,” said Joe Blommaert, president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. “By helping to activate new markets for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, this project can play an important part in achieving America’s lower-emissions aspirations.”\nThe proposed hydrogen facility would produce up to 1 billion cubic feet per day of “blue” hydrogen, which is an industry term for hydrogen produced from natural gas and supported by carbon capture and storage. The carbon capture infrastructure for this project would have the capacity to transport and store up to 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year, more than doubling ExxonMobil’s current capacity. \nUsing hydrogen as a fuel at the Baytown olefins plant could reduce the integrated complex’s Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions by up to 30%, supporting ExxonMobil’s ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions from its operated assets by 2050. It also would enable the site to manufacture lower-emissions products for its customers. Access to surplus hydrogen and CO2 storage capacity would be made available to nearby industry.\nThe project would form ExxonMobil’s initial contribution to a broad, cross-industry effort to establish a Houston carbon capture and storage hub with an initial target of about 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030, and 100 million metric tons by 2040. Evaluation and planning for the Baytown project are ongoing and, subject to stakeholder support, regulatory permitting and market conditions, a final investment decision is expected in two to three years.\nExxonMobil has extensive experience with hydrogen and already produces about 1.5 billion cubic feet per day. The company is uniquely positioned to participate in the growing hydrogen market and is evaluating strategic investments to increase the use of this important lower-emissions energy technology.\nEqually important is the company’s more than 30 years of experience capturing and permanently storing CO2. ExxonMobil has cumulatively captured more human-made CO2 than any other company and has an equity share of about one-fifth of the world’s carbon capture and storage capacity, which amounts to about 9 million metric tons per year.\nExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business was established to commercialize low-emission technologies and is focusing on carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels – technologies where the company can leverage its core competencies and competitive advantages. Over the next six years, the company plans to invest more than $15 billion on lower-emission initiatives and could increase investments with advancements in policy and technology.\nSound government policies will accelerate the deployment of key technologies at the pace and scale required to support a societal net-zero future. Predictable, stable, cost-effective policies are necessary to incentivize the development and scalability of a wide range of low-emission technologies, including hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. ExxonMobil continues to support an explicit price on carbon to establish consistent incentives and encourage investments.\nExxonMobil is committed to helping society reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the company’s emissions intensity and developing and deploying emission-reducing technologies and products.

{"id":7095,"text":"IRVING, Texas – April 29, 2022 – Exxon Mobil Corporation today announced estimated first-quarter 2022 earnings of $5.5 billion, or $1.28 per share assuming dilution. First-quarter results included an unfavorable identified item of $3.4 billion associated with our planned exit from Russia Sakhalin-1, or $0.79 per share assuming dilution. First-quarter capital and exploration expenditures were $4.9 billion. \n  * Earned $5.5 billion in first quarter 2022; generated $14.8 billion of cash flow from operating activities, more than covering capital investment and shareholder distributions \n  * Earnings excluding identified items were $8.8 billion, an increase of more than $6 billion versus the first quarter of 2021, after adjusting for a $3.4 billion after-tax charge related to the company's Russia Sakhalin-1 operation\n  * Announced increase in share repurchase program up to a total of $30 billion through 2023\n  * Achieved first oil at the Liza Phase 2 development in Guyana; Payara FPSO construction approximately five months ahead of schedule with start-up likely before year-end 2023; announced five new discoveries, increasing the estimated recoverable resource base for the Stabroek block to nearly 11 billion oil-equivalent barrels\n  * Progressed significant lower-emission opportunities, including plans for a world-scale blue hydrogen plant supported by one of the world's largest carbon capture and storage projects in Baytown, Texas, and received top certification for methane emission management at Poker Lake in the Permian Basin\n  * Effective April 1, to further capture benefits of technology, scale, and integration, the corporation formed ExxonMobil Product Solutions, combining world-scale Downstream and Chemical businesses, and centralized Technology & Engineering and Operations & Sustainability groups\nOil-equivalent production was 3.7 million barrels per day, down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2021 due to weather-related unscheduled downtime, planned maintenance, lower entitlements associated with higher prices, and divestments. Excluding entitlement effects, government mandates, and divestments, oil-equivalent production was down 2%.  \n  \n“The quarter illustrated the strength of our underlying business and significant progress in further developing our competitively advantaged production portfolio,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “Earnings increased modestly, as strong margin improvement and underlying growth was offset by weather and timing impacts. The absence of these temporary impacts in March provides strong, positive momentum for the second quarter.”\n Financial Highlights\n  * First-quarter earnings of $5.5 billion compared with $8.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding identified items, earnings of $8.8 billion were slightly higher than the prior quarter, as higher industry prices and margins and reduced expenses were largely offset by a temporary reduction in volumes, unfavorable mark-to-market derivative effects, and price timing impacts. \n  * First-quarter cash increased by $4.3 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, as strong cash flow from operations more than funded capital investment, additional debt reduction, and shareholder distributions in the quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $11 billion.\n  * With the balance sheet well within the targeted debt-to-capital range of 20-25%, the company initiated its previously announced $10 billion buyback program, repurchasing shares totaling $2.1 billion during the quarter. The company has increased this program and now expects to repurchase up to a total of $30 billion through 2023.\n  * Effective April 1, to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to better serve our customers, the corporation formed ExxonMobil Product Solutions, combining world-scale Downstream and Chemical businesses, and centralized Technology & Engineering and Operations & Sustainability groups. This new integrated business will be focused on high-value products, improving portfolio value, and leading in sustainability. The new centralized organizations will fully leverage functional expertise and quickly deploy best practices across the globe.\n Leading the Drive to Net Zero\n  * In January, ExxonMobil announced its ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from operated assets by 2050. This ambition applies to Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions and builds on the company’s 2030 emission-reduction plans. \n  * The company reached a final investment decision to expand carbon capture capacity at its facility in LaBarge, Wyoming, adding up to 1.2 million metric tons to the nearly 7 million metric tons already captured at LaBarge each year. \n  * ExxonMobil announced plans for its first world-scale blue hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas. The proposed plant would produce up to 1 billion cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen and include one of the world’s largest carbon capture and storage projects, doubling the company’s industry-leading carbon capture capacity and providing a potential anchor for the ambitious Houston Industrial Hub emissions reduction project.\n  * The company advanced several renewable fuel initiatives, including planned renewable diesel production through an equity investment in Global Clean Energy Holdings. In partnership with Neste, the company also agreed to deliver sustainable aviation fuel to Virgin Atlantic and Singapore Airlines. \n  * Earlier this month, ExxonMobil began selling commercial volumes of certified natural gas after MiQ, an independent validator, certified the company’s assets in the Permian Basin with an \"A\" grade – the highest recognition possible – for its methane and emissions-reduction processes and technology applications. The company plans to expand the certification process to other operations in the United States.\n  * The company recently announced that Dan Ammann has been appointed president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, effective May 1. Ammann previously served as president and CEO of General Motors’ Cruise autonomous vehicle company\n Earnings and volume summary by segment\n  * First-quarter 2022 Upstream earnings of $4.5 billion compared with $6.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding identified items, earnings were $7.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from the previous quarter, primarily due to higher liquids prices and lower expenses, partly offset by lower volumes driven by weather-related impacts, fewer days in the quarter, price entitlement effects, and divestments. Average realizations for crude oil increased 28%. \n  * Oil-equivalent production in the first quarter was 3.7 million barrels per day. Excluding entitlement effects, divestments, and government mandates, oil-equivalent production decreased 2% versus the fourth quarter 2021. Liquids volumes were down 119,000 barrels per day, while natural gas volumes were down 132 million cubic feet per day. By the end of the quarter, production had fully recovered from weather-related impacts.\n  * Relative to the first quarter of 2021, earnings excluding identified items increased $5.2 billion, primarily due to higher industry prices, which were partly offset by lower volumes. Average realizations for crude oil increased 68%, while natural gas realizations increased 137%. Excluding entitlement effects, divestments, and government mandates, oil-equivalent production decreased 2%. Liquids volumes were up slightly, while natural gas volumes were down 721 million cubic feet per day.\n  * The company is discontinuing operations at the Sakhalin-1 venture (“Sakhalin”). As operator of Sakhalin, the company remains focused on the safety of people, protection of the environment, and integrity of operations. In the first quarter the company recorded a charge of $3.4 billion related to its investment in the project, which is reflected as an identified item and mainly impacts the Upstream segment.\n  * The Permian Basin continued to improve efficiency and grow production, reaching production of 560,000 barrels per day at the end of the quarter. The company remains on track to deliver a production increase of 25% this year versus full-year 2021, and to eliminate routine flaring by year end.\n  * In February, the company started production at its second major development offshore Guyana. The successful start-up of the Liza Phase 2 development brought total production capacity to more than 340,000 barrels per day. In early April, ExxonMobil announced it made a final investment decision for the Yellowtail development. Yellowtail will be the company’s fourth and largest development to date in Guyana with production capacity of 250,000 barrels of oil per day. It is expected to begin production in 2025. Additionally, Payara FPSO construction is running approximately five months ahead of schedule with start-up likely before year-end 2023.\n  * ExxonMobil continued to progress its global LNG growth strategy to meet growing worldwide demand for reliable gas supply. Commissioning of the Area 4 Coral South Floating LNG project in Mozambique is underway, with first production expected this year, and the company signed the P’nyang Gas Agreement in Papua New Guinea. Additionally, construction of the Golden Pass liquefaction facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast remains on schedule.\n  * First-quarter 2022 Downstream earnings of $0.3 billion compared with $1.5 billion in fourth quarter 2021. Improved industry fuels refining margins and lower expenses were partially offset by lower basestock margins and lower volumes, driven by higher turnaround activity. Results were also impacted by unfavorable mark-to-market impacts and price timing effects that are expected to reverse or unwind over time.\n  * Global refining margins improved from the fourth quarter despite softening seasonal demand, higher natural gas prices in Europe, and lagging jet demand recovery. By the end of the first quarter, industry margins improved to levels above the 10-year range, with the tight supply \/ demand balance expected to persist. While average basestock margins declined from the prior quarter, pricing in April is catching up to rising feedstock costs.\n  * Refining throughput was lower than in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased planned maintenance activity.\n  * Compared to the first quarter of 2021, earnings excluding identified items increased $0.7 billion, primarily due to higher industry refining margins, the absence of unfavorable one-time impacts, and improved reliability.\n  * The Permian Crude Venture remains on track for phased expansion in 2023 and 2024. The project will significantly expand pipeline capacity to transport Permian crude to both the Baytown and Beaumont, Texas refineries, and includes a 250,000 barrel per day light crude processing expansion at Beaumont. Transport fuels production is expected to increase by nearly 125,000 barrels per day in 2023.\n  * First-quarter 2022 Chemical earnings of $1.4 billion compared with $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter 2021. Excluding identified items, earnings of $1.4 billion in the first quarter 2022 compared with $1.3 billion in the previous quarter. The increase was driven by lower expenses and higher volumes on improved production mix, partly offset by lower margins. \n  * Compared to the first quarter of 2021, earnings excluding identified items were down slightly as increased project and planned maintenance spend offset higher volumes.\n  * While first-quarter global industry chemical margins declined, with bottom-of-cycle conditions in Asia Pacific, ExxonMobil’s advantaged portfolio continued to capture value from its ethane feed advantage to deliver strong results.\n  * The recently completed Corpus Christi Chemical Complex is already delivering positive cash and earnings results, despite still ramping up to full production capacity.\n  * The company is progressing plans to increase its global offer of certified circular polymer with capacity to process up to 500,000 metric tons of plastic waste per year by 2026. ExxonMobil is leveraging existing assets and proprietary advanced recycling technology to increase its capacity to process a wide range of plastic waste. Operations in Baytown will be among North America’s largest advanced plastic waste recycling facilities when its expansion is complete later this year, and will have an initial planned capacity to recycle 30,000 metric tons of plastic waste per year. The company is also evaluating and progressing other opportunities in France, the Netherlands, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada, and Singapore. In the first quarter of 2022, the company announced its first commercial sale of certified circular polymer using its Exxtend™ technology for advanced recycling of plastic waste.\n  * ExxonMobil is growing high-value, performance product capacity with competitively advantaged projects. The company's new polypropylene manufacturing unit in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is expected to start up by year-end 2022. Construction of the new Vistamaxx™ performance polymer and linear alpha olefins (LAO) manufacturing units in Baytown are progressing toward a mid-2023 start-up. ExxonMobil will manufacture 10 high-purity LAO products and market this new offering under the Elevexx™ brand name. LAOs are used in a broad range of applications, including plastic packaging, high-performing engine and industrial oils, surfactants and other specialty chemicals.\n  * Corporate and Financing reported net charges of $0.7 billion in the first quarter 2022, compared with $0.6 billion in the fourth quarter 2021. Excluding an identified items charge of $0.1 billion related to Russia, net charges were essentially flat. \n  * Net charges of $0.7 billion in the first quarter 2022 compared with $0.8 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding identified items, costs declined $0.2 billion, driven by lower pension-related corporate costs. \nExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters during a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on April 29, 2022.

This was mainly due to cost-cutting measures implemented at an early stage – in some cases even before outbreak of the crisis. Following the successful completion of the \"Fitness 2009\" programme with savings of more than EUR 550 million, we reached savings of more than EUR 300 million in the reporting year with the follow-up \"FitnessPlus 2010\" programme. The measures undertaken in the last two years to sustainably reduce administration and distribution costs as well as repair expenses in the cement business, the streamlining of our location portfolio, and our purchasing initiatives are reflected in the improved quality of profit and strengthened competitiveness.\n\"In 2010, the HeidelbergCement team successfully demonstrated implementation capabilities and cost efficiency once again\", said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. \"We increased our turnover, operating income, and profit for the financial year in a challenging environment. In addition, HeidelbergCement is one of the few companies in our industry that managed to improve its operating margin overall as well as in the two core business lines of cement and aggregates.\"\nIncreased turnover, operating margin and net profit\nGroup turnover increased by 5.8% to EUR 11,762 million (previous year: 11,117), supported by consistently good performance in the growing markets in Asia and Africa as well as advantageous exchange rate effects. Across the Group, sales volumes for cement and clinker, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete virtually remained constant.\nOperating income before depreciation (OIBD) rose by 6.5% to EUR 2,239 million (previous year: 2,102); operating income increased by 8.6% to EUR 1,430 million (previous year: 1,317). In North America, operating income more than doubled as a result of cost-saving measures and improved margins for cement and aggregates. In Africa, cement sales volumes increased by almost 13% to 5.2 million tonnes and operating income reached a new record. In Asia, operating income before depreciation margin was kept almost constant at 27.5%, a peak value even in comparison with the rest of the industry, thanks to the continuing high level of demand.\nDue to lower financing costs and significantly fewer goodwill impairment than in the previous year, the profit for the financial year more than tripled to EUR 511 million (previous year: 168). Earnings per share improved to EUR 1.83 (previous year: 0.30).\nIn view of the improved business development and the maintained focus on the reduction of net debt, the Managing Board and Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting that the dividend be increased to EUR 0.25 per share (previous year: 0.12).\nFurther improvement in financing structure and credit rating\nIn 2010, HeidelbergCement noticeably improved its financing structure through successful bond issues with a volume of more than EUR 2 billion and the arrangement of a new credit line of EUR 3 billion, comfortably ensuring liquidity until the end of 2013. As a result, it was possible to reduce credit margins by more than 50% and the number of participating financial institutions to 17 core banks. The rating agencies responded to the successful improvement of the financing structure by further upgrading HeidelbergCement’s credit rating.\nThanks to successful cost-saving measures and consistent cash management, HeidelbergCement reduced its net debt by a further EUR 0.3 billion to EUR 8.1 billion.\nAs a result, gearing improved to 62.9% (previous year: 76.5%). The liquidity reserve increased to around EUR 3.5 billion at the end of 2010.\nTargeted expansion of market position in growing markets\nIn 2010, HeidelbergCement was consistent and disciplined in continuing the targeted expansion of its market position in the cement business line in growing markets. Two new cement mills with a total capacity of 1.5 million tonnes were commissioned at the Cirebon plant in Indonesia. In September, HeidelbergCement signed an agreement with Forrest Group and now holds the majority share in its cement activities with a capacity of 500,000 tonnes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In autumn, we also acquired the majority share in CJSC \"Construction Materials\", which operates a modern cement plant with a capacity of 2 million tonnes in the Russian Republic of Bashkortostan, an attractive growth region in the Urals.\nConstruction work on the new Tula cement plant in Russia, with a capacity of 2 million tonnes, proceeded as planned. The start of production, to supply the Moscow market, is scheduled for the end of May 2011. The expansion of capacities at the Górazdze cement plant in Poland is also proceeding as planned, and is set to be completed in 2012.\nA cement mill with a capacity of 0.8 million tonnes is currently being constructed in Bangladesh. In addition, a project was started to expand the capacities in central India by 2.9 million tonnes. The complete expansion programme for growing markets, which started as early as 2008, involves capacity expansions of around 20 million tonnes by 2012. HeidelbergCement is thus creating potential for future growth.\nOutlook for 2011\nHeidelbergCement expects the global economy to continue its recovery, albeit at a somewhat weaker level than in 2010. The growth rates in the emerging countries of Asia and Africa will remain significantly above those of the mature markets in North America and Europe.\nIn the Western and Northern Europe Group area, we generally anticipate further recovery in demand and thus increasing sales volumes for cement and aggregates, which will be primarily driven by strong trends in Scandinavia and Germany. We expect varying trends in the Eastern Europe-Central Asia Group area: Development should remain weak in Hungary and Romania, while demand is set to rise in Poland and Central Asia in particular and, in the second half of 2011, in the Czech Republic. In North America, we anticipate a slight increase in cement and aggregates volumes because of ongoing investments in road construction in the United States and the continuing positive development of the commodity industry in Canada. We expect demand to continue developing positively in the Asia-Pacific and Africa-Mediterranean Basin Group areas.\nOn the cost side, HeidelbergCement anticipates an increase in energy and commodity prices as well as rising inflation, particularly in emerging countries. In the mature markets, we also expect an increase in personnel costs. HeidelbergCement's aim is to offset the rise in costs through cost-saving measures and targeted price increases as well as fuel surcharges in the individual markets.\nOn the basis of these assumptions, the Managing Board has set the objective of further increasing turnover and operating income in 2011.\n\"In view of the slow recovery in the mature markets and the rising costs and inflationary pressure, we are maintaining our focus on cash flow and stable margins in order to reduce our debt and further improve our key financial ratios\", explains Dr. Bernd Scheifele. \"With our \"FOX 2013\" programme launched in January 2011, we are continuing our efforts to consistently reduce costs and increase efficiency. In particular, we want to achieve our aim of making HeidelbergCement not only the largest manufacturer of aggregates in the world, but also the most profitable. At the same time we will continue to invest in a focussed way in cement capacities in growth markets. Thanks to our positioning in attractive markets both in emerging and industrialised countries, and our global market leadership in aggregates, HeidelbergCement is ideally positioned to benefit over-proportionally from the continued recovery of the global economy, supported by growth acceleration in North America.\"\nOverview of the HeidelbergCement Group\nEURm\n2009\n2010\ntotal\nl-f-l*\nProfit and Loss Accounts\n\n\n\n\nTurnover\n11,117\n11,762\n5.8%\n-0.5%\nOIBD\n2,102\n2,239\n6.5%\n-0.3%\nin % of turnover\n18.9%\n19.0%\n\n\nOperating Income\n1,317\n1,430\n8.6%\n0.6%\nNet Profit\n168\n511\n204.7%\n\nEarnings per share (IAS 33)**\n0.30\n1.83\n509.4%\n\nCash flow statement\n\n\n\n\nCash flow from operating activities\n1,164\n1,144\n-1.7%\n\nTotal investments\n-820\n-872\n6.3%\n\nBalance sheet\n\n\n\n\nNet debt***\n8,423\n8,146\n-3.3%\n\nGearing\n76.5%\n62.9%\n\n\n*    At constant scope, exchange rates, and stock level.\n**  Attributable to the parent entity.\n*** Excluding puttable minorities.\n10,070 characters","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2011-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","title":"HeidelbergCement reports Group annual results 2010","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Other","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/heidelbergcement-reports-group-annual-results-2010","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":7119,"text":"HeidelbergCement today celebrates the opening of a modernized kiln line at its Polish cement plant in Górazdze. The expansion of the clinker capacity to 6,000 tonnes per day had already been completed on schedule at the beginning of April and was commissioned shortly thereafter.\n\"Modernising the kiln line No 2 in our Górazdze cement plant has enabled us to successfully complete another project as part of our investment programme in attractive growth markets,\" explains Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. \"By deploying state-of-the-art technology, we reduce specific energy consumption and CO2 emissions per tonne of cement and create the premise for the increased use of alternative fuels. With this capacity expansion, we are able to better meet the increasing demand for building materials in Poland, while continuing to strengthen our position as market leader.\"\nGórazdze is HeidelbergCement's largest, most advanced cement plant in all of Europe. Already in 2003, the kiln line No 1 had been modernized and its clinker capacity extended. The current capacity expansion is realised in two phases. In the first phase, the clinker capacity of kiln line 2 was increased from 3,500 to 6,000 tonnes per day. In the second phase, the construction of a new cement mill is intended to expand the grinding capacity for cement in line with the new clinker capacity. This second phase is scheduled for completion in mid-2012. Once the project is fully implemented, cement capacity will increase by 1.2 million tonnes per year.\nEuroconstruct, the European construction business research group, anticipates in its latest forecast for Poland a rise in cement consumption of 15% and 5% for 2011 and 2012. Domestic demand will increase, in particular, as a result of the further development of transport infrastructure and the growing demand in residential construction.\nAbout HeidelbergCement\nHeidelbergCement is one of the largest building materials manufacturers worldwide, as the global market leader in aggregates and with leading positions in cement, concrete, and other downstream activities.

Sales volumes, revenue and OI of the Group increased compared to the prior year, in line with the outlook given in the 2010 annual report. The improvements reflect the continued growth in HeidelbergCement’s emerging markets and the ongoing recovery of its mature markets in North America and Europe after having reached the bottom of the crisis in 2010. Sales volumes in Europe benefited from mild winter weather both at the beginning and end of 2011. Continued cost saving efforts contributed to the increase in OI and OIBD that was achieved despite a significantly larger than expected rise in energy costs in the first half of 2011 following the Fukushima accident.\n“We are pleased that we achieved our goal of increasing revenue and operating income in 2011 despite the significant surge in energy costs earlier in the year,” said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, CEO of HeidelbergCement. “Once again we could reap the benefit from our advantageous geographical positioning in growth markets and the successful continuation of our efficiency and cost-saving programmes.

Operating margins for the full year declined as sales price increases could not fully offset a significant surge in energy prices. The positive contribution to OI from emission rights declined by about €130 million to less than €10 million in 2011. The reduction was due mainly to two effects: the collapse of prices for emission rights in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the consequential decision to save surplus emission rights for future periods. The “FOX 2013” programme exceeded expectations and resulted in cash savings of €384 million including cost savings of more than €100 million in 2011. In consideration of the demographic development, the company successfully renegotiated several pension schemes in North America and Western Europe in order to reduce balance sheet risks arising from the expected future increase of healthcare and pension costs. These efforts resulted in savings of about €130 million on top of the FOX 2013 program over the last three quarters of 2011.\nFull year 2011 revenue and results were negatively influenced by currency effects, in particular by the weakening of the US dollar compared to the euro. This mainly affected the Group areas North America and Africa-Mediterranean Basin. Adjusted for currency and consolidation effects, full year 2011 Group revenue, OIBD and OI increased by 10.7%, 4.0% and 3.2% respectively.\nSupported by a solid development in all Group areas and a late winter start in Europe and North America, revenue and sales volumes continued to improve in the fourth quarter 2011. Excluding effects from emission rights and pensions, OIBD of the underlying business improved by 19.4% and OIBD margin increased by 0.8 percentage points in the fourth quarter as a consequence of the warm weather and easing energy cost pressure. Currency effects did not play a role for the fourth quarter 2011 revenue and results.\nAt the end of December 2011, the number of employees in HeidelbergCement’s continuing operations was 52,526 (previous year 53,437). The reduction of 911 employees essentially results from two opposing developments: On the one hand, more than 1,200 job cuts were made in the North America Group area, the United Kingdom and some Eastern European countries as a result of overhead efficiency improvement programmes, location optimisations and capacity adjustments. On the other hand, we hired about 400 new employees in growth markets where we installed new capacities, for example in Indonesia and India.\nWestern and Northern Europe\nJanuary - December\nOctober - December\n€m\n2010\n2011\n%\n% l-f-l\n2010\n2011\n%\n% l-f-l\nRevenue\n3,811\n4,318\n13.3%\n13.5%\n906\n1,056\n16.5%\n17.7%\nOperating income before\ndepreciation (OIBD)\n683\n734\n7.4%\n7.0%\n225\n183\n-18.6%\n-19.2%\nin % of turnover\n17.9%\n17.0%\n24.9%\n17.4%\nOperating income\n407\n427\n4.9%\n4.1%\n151\n94\n-37.4%\n-38.1%\nSales volumes\nCement\/clinker\/GGBS (Mt)\n19.7\n22.1\n12.4%\n12.4%\n4.7\n5.5\n16.2%\n16.2%\nAggregates (Mt)\n68.8\n79.1\n14.9%\n14.9%\n16.1\n19.2\n19.3%\n19.3%\nRmc (Mm³)\n11.7\n13.8\n17.8%\n17.6%\n2.8\n3.4\n21.5%\n21.3%\nAsphalt (Mt)\n3.4\n3.6\n7.6%\n7.6%\n0.8\n0.8\n6.7%\n6.7%\nThe business development in Western and Northern Europe in 2011 was supported by the mild weather conditions at the beginning and at the end of the year that led to an extended construction season.

Fourth quarter sales volumes and revenue increased strongly due to the late winter start. However, OIBD and OI in the fourth quarter declined compared with the same period of 2010 because of lower income from emission rights.

{"id":7134,"text":"HeidelbergCement completed the capacity expansion project at its cement plant in Górazdze, Poland, with the commissioning of a new cement mill. The new mill, which is the largest ball mill in Europe, has a capacity of 1.4 million tonnes per year and ideally complements last year’s increased kiln capacity. In 2012, total cement capacity in Poland rises to 5.6 million tonnes.\n\"With the new mill we successfully complete another important project of our investment programme in attractive growth markets,\" explains Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. \"The expansion of both kiln and mill capacity was done in a very capital efficient way with total investment costs of less than €80 per tonne of cement. The expanded capacities enable us to better meet rising demand for building materials in Poland, while continuing to strengthen our position as the market leader in the country. With the new mill we are able to manufacture various types of cement, depending on the market and customers’ demand.\"\nGórazdze is HeidelbergCement's largest, most modern cement plant in Europe. In 2011, the clinker capacity was expanded from 3.1 to 4.0 million tonnes per year. By using state-of-the-art technology, HeidelbergCement reduced specific energy consumption and CO2 emissions per tonne of cement and increased the use of alternative fuels. With the installation of the new ball mill, the cement grinding capacity is increased in line with the expanded clinker capacity.\nIn the next three to four years, strong cement consumption is anticipated for Poland. Domestic demand will increase, in particular, as a result of the further development of infrastructure investments and the growing demand in residential construction.\nAbout HeidelbergCement\nHeidelbergCement is one of the largest building materials manufacturers worldwide, as the global market leader in aggregates and with leading positions in cement, concrete, and other downstream activities.

{"id":7137,"text":"on Thursday, 3 May 2012, at the Kongresshaus Stadthalle Heidelberg, Germany\nIn his speech to about 450 shareholders, CEO Dr. Bernd Scheifele offered a look back at HeidelbergCement’s successful development in 2011. Despite a massive surge in energy costs, HeidelbergCement was among the few companies in the building materials sector to achieve increases in revenue, operating income, and net income. The improvements were attributable to HeidelbergCement’s excellent geographical positioning in local growth markets, as well as the successful implementation of the programme for financial and operational excellence “FOX 2013”. Continued systematic debt reduction resulted in stronger key financial figures, which led to an upgrading of the company’s credit rating by the rating agencies. During the crisis, HeidelbergCement carried on investing in attractive growth markets. In 2011 alone, the company expanded cement production capacity by a further 3 million tonnes in Poland and Russia.\nThe shareholder structure of HeidelbergCement continued to diversify over the past 12 months along with an increase in the proportion of North American and European value-oriented investors in the shareholder pool. The shareprice of HeidelbergCement recovered significantly but lagged the development of the DAX after a phase of weakness in the middle of 2011, when the European debt crisis and uncertainties about the recovery of the US weighed on the stock. Since the start of 2012, HeidelbergCement shares outperformed the peers and indices.\nOutlook for 2012 confirmed\nDr. Scheifele also reported on the results and developments in the recently ended first quarter 2012, reconfirming HeidelbergCement’s outlook for the remainder of the year as presented at the press conference on 2011 results in March. HeidelbergCement will continue its efforts to increase efficiency and reduce debt, while maintaining its strategy of targeted investment in cement capacities in growth markets. Thanks to the company's global presence in attractive markets throughout both the emerging and industrialised world, and as market leader in aggregates, HeidelbergCement is ideally positioned to benefit over-proportionally from a further global economic recovery.\nDividend increased by 40%\nThe Annual General Meeting has approved the proposal of the administration to increase the dividend by 40% to €0.35 with a substantial majority of 99.97%. “The increase of the dividend is a clear signal to our retail shareholders that we are committed to reach an industry standard payout ratio of between 30% and 35% in the mid-term,” explained Dr. Bernd Scheifele.\nOf the company’s € 562.5 million in subscribed share capital, 73.41% were represented.\n2,760 characters","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2012-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","title":"HeidelbergCement – Annual General Meeting","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Other","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/heidelbergcement-annual-general-meeting-0","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":7143,"text":"HeidelbergCement has commissioned a new cement mill with an annual capacity of 1 million tonnes at its Tema cement grinding plant in Ghana. Capital expenditure amounted to €16 million. With around 300,000 inhabitants, Tema is one of the most important coastal cities of the country, located 25 kilometers to the east of the capital of Accra.\nHeidelbergCement’s subsidiary, Ghacem Ltd., operates two cement grinding plants in the coastal cities of Tema and Takoradi. With the commissioning of the new mill, the company increased its cement grinding capacity to 3.7 million tonnes.\n“The commissioning of the new cement mill is part of our strategy of focusing on expanding our clinker and cement capacities in attractive growth markets. In addition to Asia and Eastern Europe, these include, in particular, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa,” said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “Ghana’s stable democracy and dynamic economic growth lead to a quickly rising demand for high quality cement and other building materials for infrastructure and residential construction. We will continue our growth strategy in sub-Saharan Africa: in September, we already announced the construction of a new clinker plant and a new cement grinding installation in the neighbouring country of Togo.”\nAccording to the prognosis of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Ghana’s economy is expected to grow by more than 8% in 2012. In addition to gold, timber and cocoa, the traditional main exports of the country, oil production off Ghana’s coast has become another important driving force for the economy.\nAbout HeidelbergCement\nHeidelbergCement is one of the largest building materials manufacturers worldwide, as the global market leader in aggregates and with leading positions in cement, concrete, and other downstream activities.

{"id":7149,"text":"In Ghana, HeidelbergCement is constructing a new cement mill with an annual capacity of 0.8 million tonnes at its grinding plant in the port city of Takoradi. The investment of US$ 30 million also includes the construction of a new clinker and a new cement silo as well as the installation of new cement bag packing and dispatch facilities. In November 2012, HeidelbergCement inaugurated a new 1 million tonnes cement mill at its grinding plant in Tema some 25 km east of the capital city of Accra.\n“The construction of the new cement mill in Ghana is another project in the context of our strategy of expanding our clinker and cement capacities in growth markets. In particular the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have a very high growth potential due to their early stage of industrialisation and rich natural resources”, said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “We recently increased the mill capacity at our Tema plant. Together, the two cement grinding plants in Ghana constitute our largest capacities in West Africa. With the new mill, we want to expand our capacities in line with the rapidly growing cement consumption and maintain our dominant position in this key market.”\nBy setting up adequate capacity to better serve the growing market in the important coastal cities as well as throughout Ghana, HeidelbergCement aims at maintaining its competitive edge in West Africa.\nCommissioning of the new mill is scheduled for late 2014.

While construction activity in Europe and large parts of North America was hindered due to the long, cold winter, our building material deliveries benefited from the sustained growth in demand in our Asian and African markets as well as from the continued economic recovery in North America. Sales volumes were also negatively affected by the reduced number of working days compared with the previous year.\nThe Group’s cement and clinker sales volumes remained relatively stable with a slight decline of 0.7% to 18.1 million tonnes (previous year: 18.2). The growth in sales volumes in the North America, Asia-Pacific, and Africa-Mediterranean Basin Group areas almost completely compensated for losses in the European markets. Despite poor weather in eastern and northern USA, North America overall still achieved solid growth in sales volumes. In the Asia-Pacific and Africa-Mediterranean Basin Group areas, the expansion of our cement capacities in India and the high increase in volumes in Ghana and Togo contributed, among others, to a slight increase in sales volumes. Cement sales volumes in the Western and Northern Europe Group area declined significantly due to the poor weather conditions. The harsh winter, coupled with difficult market conditions in some countries, also resulted in a loss of sales volumes in Eastern Europe-Central Asia.\nAggregates sales volumes decreased Group wide by 10.8% to 41.9 million tonnes (previous year: 47.0). Ready-mixed concrete deliveries fell by 2.1% to 7.9 million cubic metres (previous year: 8.1). Asphalt sales volumes decreased by 8.6% to 1.3 million tonnes (previous year: 1.4).\nRevenue almost stable – operating income improved\nGroup revenue for the period from January to March 2013 decreased slightly by 1.4% to €2,761 million (previous year: 2,799). The prolonged winter put a strain on sales volumes and revenue primarily in the Western and Northern Europe and Eastern Europe-Central Asia Group areas. In operational terms, the other Group areas achieved an increase in revenue of more than 5%. Successful price increases in cement and aggregates in all Group areas had a positive impact on revenue development. The impact of changes in the consolidation scope and exchange rate effects almost completely offset each other.\nOperating income before depreciation rose by 3.5% to €219 million (previous year: 212). Operating income increased by 35% to €16 million (previous year: 12). Successful price increases and decreasing energy costs were decisive for the improvement of operating income compared to the previous year.\n“The improved operating income in Q1, despite declining sales volumes and revenue, shows that we are on the right track”, says Chairman of the Managing Board Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “The measures we introduced for improving the margins are showing results. The efficiency improvement programmes are going according to plan and we were already able to implement price increases in many of our markets.”\nThe additional ordinary result fell by €22 million to €-32 million (previous year: -10). This relates primarily to the addition to provisions totalling €32 million owing to the ruling of the Federal Court of Justice in the German antitrust proceedings. The financial result improved by €3 million to €-145 million (previous year: -148).\nProfit before tax from continuing operations fell by €15 million to €-162 million (previous year: -147). Expenses relating to taxes on income increased by €19 million to €23 million (previous year: 4). As in the previous year, the figure was primarily characterised by non-capitalised deferred taxes on losses carried forward in North America. Profit after tax from continuing operations amounts to €-184 million (previous year: -151).\nOverall, the loss for the period amounts to €-184 million (previous year: -159). The profit attributable to non-controlling interests rose by €2 million to €50 million (previous year: 48). The Group share therefore amounts to €-235 million (previous year: -208).\nAt the end of Q1 2013, the number of employees at HeidelbergCement stood at 52,613 (previous year: 53,230). The decrease of 617 employees essentially results from two opposing developments: on the one hand, around 1,800 jobs were cut in the North America Group area, in the United Kingdom, in Spain, and some Eastern European countries in connection with efficiency increases in sales and administration, location optimisations, and capacity adjustments. On the other hand, we have hired more than 900 new employees in growing markets such as India and Indonesia. In addition, the number of our employees in Australia has grown by around 250 following the increase in the stake in the proportionately consolidated cement company Cement Australia.\n“FOX 2013” programme further progressing according to plan\nThe three-year programme for financial and operational excellence (“FOX 2013”) led to an improvement in cash flow of €39 million in Q1 2013. It is thus well on the way to achieving the targeted improvement of €1,010 million over the three-year horizon. In 2011 and 2012, the programme already generated cash effective savings totalling €767 million.\nNet debt significantly reduced compared to previous year\nDue to its successful cost saving measures and consistent cash management, HeidelbergCement was able to further improve free cash flow and reduce net debt by €0.6 billion to €7.79 billion compared to the end of Q1 2012. Gearing improved to 56.2% (previous year: 63.5%).\nTargeted expansion of market position in growth markets\nIn mid-February, HeidelbergCement completed the expansion of its cement and clinker capacities in Central India. The plants, which have an annual capacity of 2.9 million tonnes, are located in the Damoh district (Narsingarh and Imlai) in the federal state of Madhya Pradesh and in Jhansi in the federal state of Uttar Pradesh. Test runs had already been conducted successfully between November 2012 and January 2013.\nAt the end of March, HeidelbergCement increased its stake in Australia’s largest cement producer, Cement Australia, from 25% to 50%, doubling the available annual cement capacity to more than 2 million tonnes. In the second half of 2013, a new grinding plant with an annual capacity of 1.1 million tonnes is scheduled to start operation in Port Kembla. The increase in the stake in Cement Australia is a good example for HeidelbergCement’s strategy of low risk bolt-on acquisitions. Following this strategy, HeidelbergCement also increased its stake in the Russian cement producer, CJSC Construction Materials in Bashkortostan, from 51% to 100% and in the British building materials producer, Midland Quarry Products (MQP), from 50% to 100%. The share of non-controlling interests in the Group share of profit decreases thereby in favour of HeidelbergCement shareholders.\nThe planned expansion of cement capacity thereby rose to just under 7 million tonnes in 2013.\nOutlook confirmed for 2013\nIn its latest forecast, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) slightly lowered the growth rates for the global economy and some key countries such as the USA, China, and Germany, but continues to expect a gentle acceleration in the global economy compared with the previous year. However, this remains subject to the industrial countries in North America and Europe continuing unabatedly with their efforts to resolve the debt crisis and to achieve budgetary consolidation. The euro debt crisis, the high level of debt in the USA, and the armed conflicts in the Middle East continue to pose political risks to the development of the global economy. As a result of automatic budget cuts, the North American Portland Cement Association reduced its estimate for US cement consumption in 2013 from 8.1% to 6.1% at the end of April; yet it simultaneously increased its estimates for the following years so that even a slight increase is projected for 2015.\nIn North America, HeidelbergCement expects a continuing economic recovery and consequently a further increasing demand for building materials, especially from residential construction and the raw materials industry. In Europe and Central Asia, HeidelbergCement anticipates a divided development: while markets in Germany, Northern Europe, Russia, and Central Asia should remain stable or continue growing, a weak development of the economy and demand for building materials is expected in all other regions. In Asia and Africa, the company expects a sustained positive demand.\nIn terms of costs, the company anticipates a light to moderate increase in the cost base for raw materials and personnel. Regarding the energy costs, the Group expects an overall stable development in 2013 following the slight decline in energy costs in the first quarter 2013 compared to the previous year. The objective is still to recover the margin loss that has arisen from the massively increasing energy costs in recent years. As a result, price increases have top priority. In 2012, the Group therefore started the two sales excellence programmes “PERFORM” for the cement business in the USA and Europe as well as “CLIMB Commercial” for the aggregates business line, in order to achieve margin improvements totalling €350 million by 2015. The Group wants to realise a further €240 million of cash savings in 2013 as part of the “FOX 2013” programme, in comparison with the base year 2010. Furthermore, HeidelbergCement is pursuing the “LEO” programme for optimising supply chains, which has the goal of achieving cost reductions of €150 million over the coming years.\nOn the basis of these assumptions, the Managing Board is continuing with the objective of further increasing revenue and operating income in 2013 and significantly improving profit before tax.\n“Business development in the first quarter has strengthened our conviction in our prospects for the 2013 financial year,” says Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “We will continue to focus our efforts on increasing sales prices. For this purpose, we will implement the sales excellence programmes “PERFORM” and “CLIMB Commercial” with high priority. At the same time, we will continue to drive our efforts to lower costs and increase efficiency with the “FOX 2013” and “LEO” programmes. The consistent reduction of net debt is still a top priority for us, with the aim of improving the relevant financial key figures to an investment grade level. We will also remain on course with our successful strategy of targeted investments to expand cement capacity in emerging countries.

The North America Group area experienced the strongest growth in sales volumes, followed by Asia-Pacific and Africa-Mediterranean Basin. Cement sales volumes in Western and Northern Europe as well as Eastern Europe-Central Asia increased also slightly. Deliveries in the United Kingdom were more than 10% above those of the previous year due to the recovery in private residential construction and current infrastructure projects in the area of London. Following the drop in demand in the first half of the year, cement sales volumes stabilised in Eastern Europe. Adjusted for consolidation effects, cement sales volumes increased by 2.9%. Deliveries of aggregates rose significantly by 6.3% to 73.1 million tonnes (previous year: 68.8); adjusted for consolidation effects, the increase amounted to 5.5%. Especially in North America, aggregates sales volumes increased considerably. Deliveries of ready-mixed concrete rose by 4.5% to 11.0 million cubic metres (previous year: 10.5). Key growth drivers were the markets in Asia, especially in Indonesia. Asphalt sales volumes fell slightly by 0.6% to 2.8 million tonnes (previous year: 2.9).\nIn the first nine months of the year, cement and clinker sales volumes increased slightly by 1.0% to 67.7 million tonnes (previous year: 67.0). While deliveries of aggregates fell marginally by 1.2% to 180.6 million tonnes (previous year: 182.9), deliveries of ready-mixed concrete rose by 2.6% to 29.8 million cubic metres (previous year: 29.0); asphalt sales volumes declined by 2.5% to 6.4 million tonnes (previous year: 6.5).\nDevelopment of revenue and results\nGroup revenue remained almost stable at €3.891 million (previous year: 3.944). The increase in sales volumes and successful cement and aggregates price increases in principal markets could not fully offset negative currency effects in the Group areas. Excluding exchange rate and consolidation effects, revenue grew by 4.9%, with all Group areas recording an increase, except for Eastern Europe-Central Asia.\nOperating income before depreciation (OIBD) declined by 7.0% to €811 million (previous year: 872), operating income decreased by 6.8% to €603 million (previous year: 647). Although the increase in sales volumes, successful price increases, and declining energy and raw material costs contributed positively to the development in results, they could not fully compensate for negative currency effects. Excluding exchange rate and consolidation effects as well as a €48 million gain from the sale of a depleted quarry in the third quarter 2012, operating income before depreciation increased by 4.2% and operating income by 7.1%.\n“The positive development of sales volumes, prices, and costs shows, that we continue to be operationally well on track”, says Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board. “Thanks to the cost savings measures implemented at an early stage, we see a significant increase in results in North America and the United Kingdom. On Group level, however, we had to face growing headwind in revenue and operating income in the third quarter, due to the significant strengthening of the euro. Our efficiency improvement programmes continue to progress according to plan.”\nAdditional ordinary result of the third quarter improved by €295.3 million to €236.3 million (previous year: -59.0), mainly due to a non-cash effective profit from the unwinding of an obsolete corporate structure of Hanson in the UK. Furthermore, the same quarter of the previous year included a loss of €43.8 million from the disposal of business units in North America. Financial result rose significantly by €48.0 million to €-135.0 million (previous year: -183.0) mainly due to a decrease in net interest expenses by 14% to €123 million.\nProfit before tax from continuing operations improved considerably by 70.5% to €720.5 million (previous year: 422.5). Tax expenses in the third quarter of 2013 amounted to €92.4 million (previous year: 98.7). Net income from continuing operations rose to €628.1 million (previous year: 323.8).\nOverall, profit for the period rose notably by 97.6% to €627.4 million (previous year: 317.6) in the third quarter. The share of profit attributable to non-controlling interests fell by €16.3 million to €47.7 million (previous year: 64.0). This was mainly the result of currency effects and the increase in the stake in the Russian cement producer CJSC Construction Materials in the Republic of Bashkortostan from 51% to 100%. Group share of profit increased by 128.6% to €579.8 million (previous year: 253.6). Accordingly, earnings per share improved considerably to €3.10 (previous year: 1.36).\nIn the first nine months of the year, Group revenue remained almost at previous year’s level with €10,450 million (previous year: 10,525). Operating income before depreciation (OIBD) fell by 0.9% to €1,764 million (previous year: 1,779); operating income declined also slightly by 0.7% to €1,143 million (previous year: 1,152). Profit for the first nine months of the financial year rose significantly to €912 million (previous year: 403). Profit attributable to non-controlling interests decreased to €157 million (previous year: 177). Group share of profit, therefore, improved considerably to €755 million (previous year: 226).\nAt the end of September 2013, the number of employees at HeidelbergCement stood at 53,621 (previous year: 53,729). The decrease of 108 employees results essentially from two opposing developments: on the one hand, the number of jobs in the North America Group area, in Benelux, Spain, and some Eastern European countries declined by more than 1,100 as a result of efficiency improvements in sales and administration, location optimisations, and capacity adjustments. On the other hand, more than 700 new employees were hired in growth markets such as Indonesia and central Asia. Furthermore, the number of employees rose by around 300 due to the increase of our stake in the proportionately consolidated cement company Cement Australia and the acquisition of the remaining 50% in the hitherto proportionately consolidated Midland Quarry Products, United Kingdom.\nNet debt increased slightly compared to the previous year – financing structure improved\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2013, HeidelbergCement’s net debt amounted to €8.0 billion, which is €0.2 billion higher compared with the end of the third quarter of 2012. Thereby, gearing rose to 61.5% (previous year: 55.0%).\nDevelopment of net debt was influenced by the complete payment of €161 million for the cartel fine confirmed by the Federal Court of Justice in Germany in April, negative currency effects, and higher investments in the first half of the year compared with the previous year. The higher amount of investments in the first half of 2013 results from the increase in HeidelbergCement’s stake in Cement Australia and in the British building materials producer Midland Quarry Products. In the first nine months of 2013, cash flow investments amounted to €930.1 million (previous year: 511.2). The overall restrictive investment policy remains unchanged.\nHeidelbergCement further improved its financing structure. In October, HeidelbergCement issued a 7 year Eurobond with an issuance volume of €300 million and a yield to maturity of 3.375%. Compared with the last Eurobond issued in spring 2012, the terms have improved once again despite longer maturity. This is a clear proof of the improved credit quality of HeidelbergCement.\n“FOX 2013” programme already achieves full-year target after 9 months – margin improvement programmes “PERFORM”, “CLIMB Commercial”, and “LEO” progress according to plan\nAfter only nine months, the three-year programme for financial and operational excellence “FOX 2013” exceeded the 2013 savings target of €240 million and generated cash savings of €253 million. The reduction of working capital as well as savings achieved in procurement and the “OPEX” project exceeded expectations. The projects that were launched to improve margins – “PERFORM” for cement, “CLIMB Commercial” for aggregates, and “LEO” for reduction of logistics costs – continue to progress according to plan.\nOutlook for 2013\nIn its latest forecast, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has further reduced growth rates for the world economy. The on-going slower growth in China and the possible ending of the extremely relaxed monetary policy in the USA have negatively impacted the growth potential and exchange rates of emerging countries. For 2013, the IMF expects a growth rate of 2.9% only, compared to 3.2% in the previous year. However, this remains subject to the industrial countries in North America and Europe continuing unabatedly with their efforts to resolve the debt crisis and to achieve budgetary consolidation. The euro debt crisis, the high level of debt in the USA, and the armed conflicts in the Middle East continue to pose political risks to the development of the world economy.\nIn North America, HeidelbergCement continues to expect an on-going economic recovery and consequently a further increasing demand for building materials, especially from residential construction and the raw materials industry. A three-layered economic development is anticipated in Europe and central Asia: The markets in Germany, Northern Europe, and the United Kingdom should continue to develop positively. Markets in central Asia should stabilise, and in Benelux and Eastern Europe a continuing weak development of the economy and demand for building materials is anticipated. In Asia and Africa, HeidelbergCement expects no changes in the sustained growth in demand.\nIn terms of costs, the Group anticipates a light to moderate increase in the cost base for raw materials and personnel. For energy costs, HeidelbergCement expects a stable or slightly declining development overall for 2013, following the slight decline in the first nine months of the year. The objective remains to recover the margin loss that has arisen from the massively increasing energy costs in recent years. Price increases have top priority. To this end, the Group started two sales excellence programmes in 2012 – “PERFORM” for the cement business in the USA and Europe as well as “CLIMB Commercial” for the aggregates business line – with the objective of achieving a margin improvement of €350 million by 2015. The Group wants to realise a further €240 million of cash-relevant savings in 2013 as part of the “FOX 2013” programme, in comparison with the base year 2010. Furthermore, HeidelbergCement is continuing the “LEO” programme for optimising supply chains, which should reduce costs by €150 million over the coming years.\nOn the basis of these assumptions, the Managing Board is continuing with the objective of further increasing revenue and operating income in 2013 and significantly improving profit before tax.\nBased on the increase in the stake of Cement Australia, Midland Quarry Products, and CJSC “Construction Materials”, the Group will probably exceed its target of €1.1 billion for cash flow investments and reach a level of about €1.35 billion. HeidelbergCement nevertheless sticks to the original target and will continue with its disciplined investment policy.\n“Despite the growing headwind, we confirm our earnings outlook for 2013, even though reaching our targets is much more challenging than assumed at the end of the first half of the year”, says Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “In view of the weakening economic development and exchange rates in some emerging countries, we will continue unabatedly with our measures to improve margins. We will maintain our focus on increasing sales prices. For this purpose, we will intensify our implementation efforts for the “PERFORM” and “CLIMB Commercial” sales excellence programmes. At the same time, we will continue to drive our efforts to lower costs and increase efficiency with the “FOX 2013” and “LEO” programmes. Deleveraging with the aim to improve the decisive key financial ratios is still a top priority for us, in order to qualify for an investment grade rating. We will also remain on course with our successful strategy of targeted investments to expand cement capacities in emerging countries. With our global market leadership in the aggregates business line and our advantageous geographical positioning in attractive markets, we will do all we can to benefit over-proportionally from the continued economic growth.”\n14,721 characters","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2013-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"HeidelbergCement reports Q3 2013 results","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Other","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/heidelbergcement-reports-q3-2013-results","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":7185,"text":"### HeidelbergCement inaugurates new greenfield clinker and cement capacities in Togo and Burkina Faso  HeidelbergCement has inaugurated the new greenfield Scantogo clinker plant in Togo on 6 March 2015. The new US$ 250 million plant possesses an annual capacity of 1.5 million tonnes (5,000 tpd) and is located at Tabligbo, some 80 kilometres north east of the capital city Lomé. More than 2,000 guests attended the ceremony, among them the president of the Republic of Togo, the president of the National Assembly and the German ambassador in Togo. With the Scantogo investment, HeidelbergCement has become the largest German foreign investor in Togo.   A day earlier, on 5 March 2015, HeidelbergCement has furthermore inaugurated the new Cimburkina cement grinding plant in Burkina Faso, the neighbouring country of Togo to the north. The new US$ 50 million plant has an annual capacity of 0.8 million tonnes and is located near the capital city Ouagadougou. More than 400 guests attended the ceremony, including the minister of Industry and Commerce, the representative of the minister of Economy and Finance, the local representative of the Emperor of the Mossi people as well as a number of traditional chiefs and religious leaders.  “The new greenfield facilities are part of our strategy of expanding our cement capacities in growth markets. In addition to Asia these include, in particular, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa”, said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement who attended both inauguration ceremonies together with Mr. Daniel Gauthier, member of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement responsible for Africa, and the General Management of the HeidelbergCement Africa team, including the respective country managers. “The new clinker plant in Togo will greatly improve our competitiveness by enabling us to replace expensive clinker imports by local sourcing. The clinker from Togo will also be used in our new grinding plant close to Ouagadougou to produce cement for the local construction industry in Burkina Faso. Our new plants are strengthening our position in both countries as well as in the whole region.”  Scantogo will supply clinker to HeidelbergCement’s West African cement grinding mills in Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, and Ghana, partly replacing expensive clinker that has previously been imported from overseas, and thereby strengthen HeidelbergCement’s competitiveness in the region.  HeidelbergCement has been present in Togo since 1984 with the Cimtogo grinder in Lomé. Scantogo represents a major industrial development and directly employs some 200 people. The new operation will also create around 1,000 additional jobs locally. It will significantly contribute to domestic cement production and local infrastructure development. Exports from Scantogo will provide Togo with important currency inflows. HeidelbergCement has also recently started to build a 0.25 million tonnes cement capacity greenfield grinder in the Kara region in the northern part of Togo, which will be ready by 2017.  IFC, a branch of the World Bank, is partially funding Scantogo. The Togolese Government will hold 10% of Scantogo.  Cimburkina will stimulate the improvement of local infrastructure and housing by providing quality cement, and is expected to create around 100 jobs at the plant, and more than 300 indirect jobs.  With the inauguration of the new capacities, HeidelbergCement further extends its footprint in the growing markets of sub-Saharan Africa. The company is now active in 8 countries south of the Sahara and operates 3 integrated cement plants, 1 clinker plant and 8 grinding plants with a total cement capacity of about 10 mt per year. By growing local clinker and cement capacities, HeidelbergCement secures adequate supply to serve these attractive growth markets and sharpens the company’s competitive edge in West Africa.  About HeidelbergCement  HeidelbergCement is the global market leader in aggregates and a prominent player in the fields of cement, concrete, and other downstream activities, making it one of the world’s largest manufacturers of building materials. The company employs some 45,000 people at 2,300 locations in more than 40 countries.

{"id":7191,"text":"Four strategic levers to drive earnings growth: significant operating leverage, cost leadership, vertical integration and a superior geographic footprint\nAmbition to achieve more than €17 billion in Group revenue and more than €4 billion in Operating EBITDA by 2019\nTarget solid investment grade as foundation for future returns\nShift capital allocation towards enhanced shareholder returns and disciplined growth in attractive markets\nCommitment to progressive dividends with a targeted pay-out ratio of 40% to 45% by the end of 2019 – potential additional return of cash through share buy-backs\nIn advance of today’s Capital Markets Day 2015 in London, HeidelbergCement announces new mid-term strategic priorities and financial targets for the five-year period until 2019. On the back of the positive outlook for the current fiscal year and a strong asset base, the Group aims to increase Group revenue from €12.6 billion in 2014 to more than €17 billion by 2019. Over the same period, Operating EBITDA is expected to grow from €2.3 billion to more than €4 billion.\nFollowing the successful deleveraging over the past years, the company also intends to further shift its priorities for capital allocation towards disciplined growth and increased shareholder returns. The Group projects cumulative free cash flow of about €8.8 billion for the period from 2015 to 2019. Of this amount, it intends to invest approximately €2.5 billion in organic growth while using approximately €1 billion to keep leverage in a range which supports a solid investment grade rating. More than €2 billion shall be allocated to shareholders through progressive dividend payments. In this context, HeidelbergCement intends to raise the pay-out ratio from 29% for fiscal year 2014 to between 40% and 45% for fiscal year 2019. Further available cash may be allocated to acquisitions or returned to shareholders through share buy-backs.\nDr Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Management Board, commented: “We have delivered on our strategy of growth and deleveraging which we announced in 2010. As we enter the next phase of our corporate development, HeidelbergCement is in an excellent position to capitalise on its considerable strengths and drive future growth and value creation. We have a compelling strategy in place which clearly differentiates us from our competitors and we remain the industry leader in business excellence and cost efficiency. Over the next five years, we intend to achieve continuous growth and significantly increase our free cash flow with the clear commitment to building shareholder value.”\nDr Lorenz Näger, Chief Financial Officer, added: “We are focused on being the first major building materials company to earn our cost of capital in 2015. On this solid financial base, we will allocate our strong free cash flow to carefully selected growth initiatives and increasing shareholder returns. We intend to significantly raise our dividend pay-out ratio and offer our shareholders progressive dividends based on affordability and sustainability.”\nFour strategic levers to enhance growth and profitability\nHeidelbergCement further improved its position as a global leader in heavy building materials during the past five years. The Group achieved leading market positions in Cement, Aggregates, Ready Mix and Asphalt and expanded its geographic footprint in mature and fast growing emerging markets. With its highly efficient business organisation and successfully implemented margin improvement programmes, the Group has established itself as the cost leader within the industry.\nOn this strong foundation, HeidelbergCement is setting out for the next phase of accelerated growth. Its mid-term strategic priorities will focus on four levers: benefit from significant operating leverage, sustain cost leadership, leverage operational strength through vertical integration and integrated management of the businesses, and capitalise on growth opportunities in attractive markets to further expand the geographic footprint.\nAs important markets improve, the Group anticipates to benefit from its considerable operating leverage which should drive further earnings growth. In order to bolster its position as an industry leader in cost management, HeidelbergCement will continue to realise efficiency improvements through the enhanced digitalisation of the value chain and by promoting a culture of entrepreneurship across the entire Group.\nIn addition, HeidelbergCement will deepen vertical integration in urban centres as a key driver of future growth and value creation. The Group has already made considerable progress in implementing an integrated management model across its asset base. By further integrating processes across business lines and sites, HeidelbergCement will be able to leverage its operational excellence on a larger scale.

{"id":7197,"text":"Disposal of lime business in Germany completed\nBridge financing for the acquisition of Italcementi successfully syndicated\nFinancing volume of bridge financing reduced by €600 million\nHeidelbergCement has taken further important steps to strengthen its financing. On 31 August , HeidelbergCement completed the disposal of its lime business in Germany to the Belgian Lhoist Group. Both companies agreed not to disclose any details about the transaction. In addition, HeidelbergCement successfully syndicated the bridge financing for the acquisition of Italcementi. All core banks of HeidelbergCement participated in equal shares in the syndication of the credit line originally provided by Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley. At the same time, the financing volume could be reduced by €600 million from €4.4 billion to €3.8 billion, because the initial risk of a mandatory offer to minority shareholders in Morocco could be excluded.\n“The disposal of the lime business in Germany and the syndication of the bridge loan with a reduced volume are futher important steps on our way to strengthen our financing,” said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “With the syndication of the bridge loan, we have laid a solid funding base for the acquisition of Italcementi. The fact that all our core banks participated in the syndication is a clear proof of the high reputation of HeidelbergCement in the banking sector and the strength of our relationships with the banks and clearly reflects that the banks are convinced of the transaction.”\nHeidelbergCement used to operate two lime plants in Germany – Walhalla Kalkwerk in Regensburg and Kalkwerk Istein close to Basel. Both lime plants were modernized in the past years with state of the art kiln technology and generated a turnover of about € 45 million in 2014 with approximately 180 employees.\nThe following banks participated in the syndication of the bridge loan: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Bayern LB, BNP Paribas, Citibank, Commerzbank, Danske Bank A\/S, Deutsche Bank, Helaba, ING Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, LBBW, Mediobanca, Nordea, RBI, RBS, SEB, Standard Chartered, Svenska Handelsbanken, and Morgan Stanley.","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2015-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Further important steps taken to strengthen financing ","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Other","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/further-important-steps-taken-to-strengthen-financing","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":7221,"text":"HeidelbergCement significantly increased results in second quarter of 2016\nHighlights Q2 2016 and outlook:\nIncreased sales volumes in all business lines\nGroup revenue stable at €3.6 billion\nOperating income rose by 8% to €601 million (previous year: €557 million; like-for-like* +11%)\nImprovement of margins in all business lines\nSignificant improvement of free cash flow; net debt reduced to €5.9 billion (previous year: €6.3 billion)\nOutlook for 2016 confirmed:\nPositive outlook for global economy; geopolitical and macroeconomic risks remain\nExpected increase in sales volumes of cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete\nModerate rise in revenue* and high single to double digit increase in operating income* and profit for the financial year**\nConclusion of the Italcementi takeover in the second half of 2016\nHeidelbergCement is well positioned to benefit from the recovery in mature markets, particularly in the USA, Germany, Northern Europe, and Australia\n* Adjusted for currency and consolidation effects; **adjusted for non-recurring effects\n\nQ2 sales volumes benefit from positive market environment in Europe, the USA, and Australia\nIn the second quarter, sales volumes increased in all business lines. The positive market environment, particularly in Europe, the USA, and Australia, made a significant contribution to this growth.\nThe Group’s cement and clinker sales volumes rose by 1.6% to 22.3 million tonnes (previous year: 21.9) in the second quarter. The strongest increase was achieved in the Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia Group area, followed by Western and Southern Europe. Northern Europe recorded double-digit growth in sales volumes on account of the sustained high level of construction activity in Sweden and a better than expected development in Norway. Cement sales in Eastern Europe rose almost everywhere. In Western and Southern Europe, cement sales volumes increased in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, in some cases significantly. In contrast, cement sales volumes fell in the Asia-Pacific Group area due to the delayed start to infrastructural projects in our core markets in Indonesia.\nDeliveries of aggregates increased by 2.9% (adjusted for consolidation effects 1.2%) to 69.1 million tonnes (previous year: 67.1). Higher sales volumes, particularly in Australia, the USA, and Germany, contributed to this development. Deliveries of ready-mixed concrete rose by 4.2% to 10.0 million cubic metres (previous year: 9.6), while deliveries of asphalt increased by 4.2% to 2.6 million tonnes (previous year: 2.5).\nIn the first half of 2016, cement and clinker sales volumes rose by 2.9% to 39.9 million tonnes (previous year: 38.8). Deliveries of aggregates climbed by 4.4% to 118.4 million tonnes (previous year: 113.4) and deliveries of ready-mixed concrete rose by 2.9% to 17.9 million cubic metres (previous year: 17.4). Asphalt sales volumes fell by 2.0% to 4.0 million tonnes (previous year: 4.0).\nRevenue stable – results considerably improved\nGroup revenue remained virtually stable in the second quarter of 2016 at €3,575 million (previous year: 3,635). Excluding consolidation and exchange rate effects, it increased by 0.6%. This primarily reflects the pleasing development of sales volumes in all business lines. Changes to the scope of consolidation had a positive impact of €72 million on revenue. In contrast, exchange rate effects reduced revenue by €151 million.\nOperating income before depreciation (OIBD) improved by 5.2% to €791 million (previous year: 752). Operating income rose by 7.8% to €601 million (previous year: 557). Excluding exchange rate and consolidation effects, the rise in operating income before and after depreciation and amortisation amounted to 8.5% and 11.2% respectively. Besides the growth in sales volumes and price increases in core markets, the declining cost of fuels in particular also made a contribution to the positive development of results.\n“In operational terms, the second quarter of 2016 was the best since the financial crisis and thus continued the positive trend of the previous year,” said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board. “The positive market environment in our mature markets and the recovery of demand in Eastern Europe made a significant contribution. We were able to raise the margins in operational terms in all business lines thanks to our margin improvement programmes and price increases in core markets. Furthermore, we have benefited from the declining fuel costs.”\nThe additional ordinary result deteriorated slightly to €-12 million (previous year: -5) in the second quarter. The financial result improved by €20 million to €-107 million (previous year: -127) especially due to the further reduction in net interest expenses. Profit before tax from continuing operations rose correspondingly by 12% to €493 million (previous year: 439).\nIn the second quarter of 2016, tax expenses decreased by €13 million to €95 million (previous year: 108). Net loss from discontinued operations amounted to €-12 million (previous year: -9) in the second quarter of 2016.\nConsequently, the profit for the period in the second quarter of 2016 rose by 19% to €385 million (previous year: 322). The profit attributable to non-controlling interests rose by €16 million to €67 million (previous year: 51). The Group share therefore improved considerably by 17% to €318 million (previous year: 271).\nIn the first half of the year, Group revenue remained virtually stable at €6,407 million (previous year: 6,470). On a comparable basis, it increased by 0.7%. OIBD improved by 5.8% to €1,112 million (previous year: 1,052) and operating income (OI) rose by 9.9% to €739 million (previous year: 672). Adjusted for negative currency effects and negligible consolidation effects, OIBD improved by 9.8% and OI even saw a marked increase by 14.9%. The financial result improved significantly by €64 million to €-221 million (previous year: -285), particularly due to a reduction in interest expenses and an improved other financial result. Profit before tax from continuing operations increased by €101 million to €507 million (previous year: 406). Expenses relating to taxes on income declined by €11 million to €131 million (previous year: 142). As a result, net income from continuing operations improved to €376 million (previous year: 264). Net loss from discontinued operations remained unchanged at €-22 million. The profit for the period rose to €354 million (previous year: 242). The profit attributable to non-controlling interests increased to €108 million (previous year: 94). The Group share therefore improved considerably by 66% to €246 million (previous year: 148).\nAt the end of the first half of 2016, the number of employees at HeidelbergCement stood at 46,632 (previous year: 45,558). The increase of 1,074 employees essentially results from two opposing developments: on the one hand, more than 600 jobs were cut in particular in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Indonesia, and India in connection with efficiency increases in sales and administration as well as location optimisations. On the other hand, the number of employees in Northern Europe rose by just under 1,400 due to the merger of our Swedish subsidiary Abetong AB and Contiga AB to form Nordic Precast Group AB. In addition, the workforce in Australia grew by around 300 employees mainly as a result of the purchase of the aggregates company Rocla Quarry Products and the insourcing of truck drivers.\nOperating cash flow significantly improved – net debt reduced\nNet debt at the end of the second quarter amounted to €5.9 billion, thus more than €450 million less than the same quarter of the previous year. A considerable improvement of free cash flow for the last twelve months by €331 million to €1,169 million (previous year: 838) contributed to the reduction in net debt. The net debt-to-equity ratio (gearing) decreased slightly to 38.1% (previous year: 40.7). Leverage fell from 2.6x to 2.2x and was therefore within the targeted range of 1.5x to 2.5x. The liquidity reserve rose from €4.1 billion to €5.4 billion as a result of measures for the pre-financing of the Italcementi takeover.\nTakeover of Italcementi well on track\nThe takeover of Italcementi is making good progress. In the second quarter of 2016, HeidelbergCement implemented another measure for the pre-financing of the Italcementi takeover at attractive conditions: In June, an eight-year Eurobond with an issue volume of €750 million and a fixed interest rate of 2.25% per year was placed. These are the most favourable conditions that HeidelbergCement has ever achieved in this maturity segment. With this bond issue, the refinancing of the Italcementi acquisition is largely completed.\nOn 1 July 2016, HeidelbergCement completed the acquisition of a 45.0% stake in Italcementi from Italmobiliare. All conditions for the closing of the transaction have been fulfilled following the approval by the relevant competition authorities.\nIn the context of acquiring the 45% stake in Italcementi, HeidelbergCement carried out a capital increase in return for contributions in kind in July 2016. The issuance of 10.5 million new shares to Italmobiliare resulted from the Authorised Capital II excluding the subscription rights of shareholders. The Group’s subscribed share capital thus rose by €31,500,000, from €563,749,431 to €595,249,431. The implementation of the increase in the subscribed share capital was recorded in the commercial register on 7 July 2016.\nThe acquisition of the 45% stake in Italcementi entails an obligation to submit a mandatory tender offer to the remaining shareholders of Italcementi. The offer document was published on 28 July 2016. The subscription period will commence on 29 August 2016 and end on 30 September 2016. The offer price will be €10.60 per Italcementi share. This corresponds to a premium of 70.7% compared to the average price of the Italcementi share during the three months prior to the publication of the Italcementi takeover at the end of July 2015. HeidelbergCement expects the entire transaction to be completed in the second half of 2016.\nThe divestment of assets in the context of the Italcementi acquisition is making good progress. On 30 June 2016, non-core assets of Italcementi were sold to Italmobiliare for total proceeds of € 237 million. As announced on 25 July 2016, HeidelbergCement, via its subsidiary Ciments Français S.A.S., entered into an agreement with Aalborg Portland Holding A\/S, a wholly owned subsidiary controlled indirectly by Cementir Holding, to sell business activities in Belgium, primarily comprising Italcementi’s Belgian subsidiary Compagnie des Ciments Belges S.A. (CCB). The agreement needs to be approved by the European Commission. This transaction has an enterprise value of €312 million. There is a high interest in the assets offered for sale in the USA, and binding offers are expected in the first half of August 2016. Overall, HeidelbergCement is well on track to reach its target of at least €1 billion of proceeds from divestments.\nOutlook for 2016 confirmed\nThe anticipated development of the HeidelbergCement Group, without taking the Italcementi takeover into consideration, is described in the following.\nIn its latest forecast of July 2016, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reduced the growth rates for the world economy in 2016 by 0.1 percentage points and now estimates economic growth at the previous year’s level of 3.1%. The lowering of the forecast reflects the anticipated consequences of the considerably increased macroeconomic and political uncertainty following the Brexit decision. The IMF expects a deterioration of economic confidence and declining investments, which are likely to have a negative impact on the United Kingdom in particular but also on the countries of continental Europe. It is already assumed that the United Kingdom and the EU will reach agreements to prevent a significant rise of economic barriers. The IMF currently predicts that the growth rate in the industrial countries will drop slightly in 2016 and increase to some extent in the emerging countries.\nThe risk factors in the development of the global economy include not only the consequences of the Brexit, which are difficult to estimate at present, but also the price trend for oil, the effects of monetary policy measures, particularly those of the US Federal Reserve, on capital flows and exchange rates in the emerging countries, as well as geopolitical risks related to the crises and conflicts in the Middle East and eastern Ukraine.\nIn North America, HeidelbergCement, in conformity with the IMF, expects a continuing economic recovery and consequently a further increase in demand for building materials. In Western and Northern Europe, positive market development is expected. This is based on the continuing solid condition of the German economy, and stable economic growth in Northern Europe and Benelux. So far, we have not yet seen any negative effects of the Brexit decision on demand for building materials in the United Kingdom. In Eastern Europe, we anticipate growing demand for building materials as result of the EU infrastructure programme, among other things. The crisis in eastern Ukraine is continuing to impair the sales volumes and results of the country. The economic situation in Russia and Kazakhstan remains difficult due to the low oil price. In the African markets, we expect a rise in competition besides the continuing growth in demand. In Asia, HeidelbergCement anticipates a general upturn in demand, thanks in particular to increasing infrastructure investments in Indonesia. In China, however, a further decline in demand and an increase in excess capacities are expected. The repercussions on exports are limited because a large proportion of Chinese capacities is located inland.\nIn view of the overall positive development of demand and the commissioning of new capacities, HeidelbergCement anticipates an increase in sales volumes of the core products cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete.\nHeidelbergCement estimates that the cost base for energy will remain stable in 2016, supposing that energy prices will drop and sales volumes will increase throughout the year. A moderate rise in the cost of raw materials and personnel is expected. HeidelbergCement further focuses on the continuous improvement of efficiency and margins. To this end we started the “Continuous Improvement” programmes in the cement and aggregates business lines to establish a culture of continuous improvement of operational and commercial work processes at employee level. Process optimisations are expected to achieve a sustainable improvement in results of at least €120 million in both business lines over a three-year period. The “CIP” programme for the cement business line started at the beginning of 2015, and the “Aggregates CI” programme was launched at the start of 2016. We also continue to optimise our logistics with the “LEO” programme, which has the goal of reducing costs by a total of €150 million over a period of several years. In addition, the “FOX” programme in purchasing is expected to achieve cost savings of around €100 million.\nIn 2016, we anticipate – without taking into account the takeover of Italcementi – a significant decrease in financing costs due to disciplined cash flow management and the refinancing of maturities at more favourable terms.\nOn the basis of these assumptions, the Managing Board has set the following goals for 2016: Excluding exchange rate and consolidation effects, a moderate increase in revenue and a high single to double digit increase in operating income and profit for the financial year (before non-recurring effects) are expected.\n“The good results of the second quarter confirm our outlook for 2016,” states Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “We will continue to concentrate on the strategic points of focus announced in 2015: shareholder returns and continuous growth. Key prerequisites for the achievement of these goals are investment discipline, a solid investment grade rating, and a progressive dividend policy. Furthermore, we are concentrating on four strategic levers: high operating leverage, maintenance of cost leadership, pronounced vertical integration, and optimal geographical positioning. In this way we will increase our efficiency and the satisfaction of our customers, especially in the world’s rapidly growing metropolitan areas. Our global programmes to optimise costs and processes and to increase margins will once again be consistently pursued in 2016. These include, in particular, the Continuous Improvement Programmes for the aggregates (“Aggregates CI”) and cement (“CIP”) business lines, as well as “FOX” for purchasing.”\n“Thanks to the positive development in the first half of the year, HeidelbergCement is in a strong position to successfully conclude the takeover of Italcementi,” continues Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “The outlook for the global economy is positive, even though the macroeonomic and political risks have increased following the Brexit decision. HeidelbergCement will continue to benefit from the good and stable economic development in the industrial countries, above all in the USA, Germany, Northern Europe, and Australia. With the acquisition of Italcementi, we are strengthening our global market position.

{"id":7227,"text":"HeidelbergCement reports results for third quarter including first-time consolidation of Italcementi\nHighlights Q3 2016 and Outlook:\nSignificant improvement in sales volumes, revenue, and operating income after first-time consolidation of Italcementi – premium earned on cost of capital\nSales volumes: 33 million tonnes of cement (+52%), 80 million tonnes of aggregates (+11%), 12 million cubic metres of ready-mixed concrete (+29%)\nGroup revenue up by 25% to €4.5 billion (previous year: 3.6)\nOperating income before depreciation (OIBD) increased by 17% to €1.0 billion (previous year: €865 million)\nProfit and net debt include acquisition-related costs\nGroup share of profit of €339 million contains acquisition-related extraordinary charges of €63 million; ytd adjusted EPS increaes to €3.39 (prior year: €3.34)\nRise in net debt to €8.9 billion following payment of the acquisition price for a 49% stake in Italcementi and takeover of the liabilities of Italcementi – pro forma leverage rose to 2.8x\nItalcementi takeover completed\nMandatory takeover bid successful at the first attempt; squeeze out and delisting of Italcementi share completed\nHeidelbergCement holds 100% of the Italcementi shares as from 12 October\nSale of business activities in Belgium and the USA almost completed as a condition of the antitrust authorities\nDivestment proceeds totalled €1.14 billion (> €100 million above plan)\nItalcementi integration faster than expected\nManagement changes in all key country organisations of Italcementi\nRedundant headquarters closed\nReduction in staff much faster than expected\nHeidelbergCement very confident to exceed the €400 million synergy target\nNew efficiency improvement programs initiated\n“Competence Center RMC” (CCR): improvement in result of €120 million over three-year period thanks to optimisations in logistics and mix design\n“Sales is a Science”: best-in-class sales and price management\nOutlook 2016 including Italcementi confirmed\nIncrease in sales volumes of cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete\nModerate increase in revenue and high single to double-digit increase in operating income on a comparable pro forma basis*\n*) Comparable pro forma basis: taking into account the contributions of Italcementi since the beginning of 2015, revenue and results adjusted for currency effects, other consolidation effects, and sales of CO\n2\nemission rights\nQ3 sales volumes at significantly higher level – first-time consolidation of Italcementi and positive market environment in mature markets\nIn the third quarter, the sales volumes of HeidelbergCement’s building materials rose significantly, as a result of the first consolidation of Italcementi. In addition, demand developed positively in numerous markets, especially in Europe, where sales volumes of cement, ready-mixed concrete, and asphalt further increased. In contrast, a very rainy summer in some parts of North America resulted in a slight decline in demand for cement and aggregates.\nThe Group’s cement and clinker sales volumes rose by 52% to 33.2 million tonnes (previous year: 21.8) in the third quarter. The sales volumes of Italcementi’s markets in Italy, France, Spain, Greece, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, India, Thailand, Egypt, Morocco, Mauritania, Gambia, and North America were included for the first time. Taking into account Italcementi’s deliveries in the same period of the previous year on a pro forma basis, the growth amounts to 5%. Cement sales could be increased in all Group areas. The strongest rise on a pro forma basis was achieved in the Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia Group area, followed by Asia-Pacific, and Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin. In North America, sales volumes rose slightly despite adverse weather conditions in some regions.\nDeliveries of aggregates increased by 11% to 80.3 million tonnes (previous year: 72.6). The sales volumes of Italcementi’s markets were included in this figure for the first time, particularly in France, Italy, Greece, Morocco, and North America. Taking into account Italcementi’s deliveries in the same period of the previous year on a pro forma basis, the growth amounts to 1%. Higher sales volumes, particularly in the Western and Southern Europe as well as Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin Group areas, contributed to this development. Deliveries of ready-mixed concrete also rose as a result of the new consolidation by 29% to 12.5 million cubic metres (previous year: 9.7). On a pro forma basis, the increase reached 2%. Asphalt sales volumes grew by 8% to 3.1 million tonnes (previous year: 2.9). Italcementi has no asphalt production facilities and therefore did not contribute any additional sales volumes.\nIn the first nine months of 2016, cement and clinker sales volumes rose by 4% on a pro forma basis to 94.2 million tonnes (previous year: 90.8). Deliveries of aggregates increased by 3% to 214.1 million tonnes (previous year: 207.8) and deliveries of ready-mixed concrete rose by 2% to 35.7 million cubic metres (previous year: 35.1). Asphalt sales volumes also increased by 2% to 7.1 million tonnes (previous year: 6.9).\nAccelerated growth of revenue and operating income\nAs a result of the first-time consolidation of Italcementi, revenue and operating income also increased significantly. Group revenue grew by 25% in the third quarter of 2016 to €4,520 million (previous year: 3,606). Operating income before depreciation (OIBD) improved by 17% to €1,009 million (previous year: 865) and operating income rose by 9% to €738 million (previous year: 675). On a comparable pro forma basis*, revenue increased slightly by around 1%. Currency effects reduced revenue by almost €100 million.\nOn a comparable pro forma basis*, the operating income before depreciation improved by 2% and the operating income after depreciation by 4%. Besides the growth in sales volumes and price increases in core markets, the declining cost of fuels in particular also made a contribution to the positive development of results.\n“With the acquisition of Italcementi, HeidelbergCement made a big leap in growth and is now the clear number two in the buildling materials industry,” said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board. “In the third quarter, we also recorded a further increase in operational terms despite adverse conditions in some markets. The integration of Italcementi is progressing faster than expected and we are very confident that we will be able to exceed the identified synergies of €400 million and to continue our profitable growth both quickly and successfully.”\nThe additional ordinary result deteriorated by €70 million to €-81 million (previous year: -11) in the third quarter. This was primarily due to extraordinary charges connected with the acquisition of Italcementi. The financial result remained unchanged at €-142 million (previous year: -142). Increasing interest expenses as a result of the assumption of Italcementi’s net debt and payment of the purchase price for 49% of the share capital were offset by lower interest expenses linked with favourable refinancing terms and the partial repayment of bonds. Profit before tax from continuing operations declined by 2% to €533 million (previous year: 546) due to the restructuring costs.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, tax expenses increased significantly by €95 million to €169 million (previous year: 74). Decisive for this development were higher tax expenses in North America because of the significantly increased profit and the consolidation of Italcementi. Net income from continuing operations consequently fell to €364 million (previous year: 472).\nAs a result, the profit for the period in the third quarter of 2016 decreased to €384 million (previous year: 520). The profit attributable to non-controlling interests rose by €3 million to €44 million (previous year: 41). The Group share therefore decreased to €339 million (previous year: 479) and the earnings per share to €1.75 (previous year: 2.55). Adjusted for acquisition-related charges of €63 million, the Group share amounted to €402 million.\nIn the first nine months of the year, Group revenue grew significantly by 8.5% to €10,927 million (previous year: 10,076). OIBD improved by 10.7% to €2,121million (previous year: 1,916) and operating income (OI) rose by 9.7% to €1,477 million (previous year: 1,347). The consolidation of Italcementi in the third quarter made a substantial contribution to this growth. On a comparable pro forma basis*, revenue grew slightly by 1% to €12.8 billion. OIBD improved by 6.4% to €2.4 billion (previous year: 2.3) and OI increased by 10.4% to €1.6 billion (previous year: 1.5). The additional ordinary result deteriorated by €98 million to €-98 million (previous year: 0). This was largely due to charges connected with the Italcementi acquisition. The financial result improved significantly by €64 million to €-363 million (previous year: -427), particularly because of a reduction in interest expenses and an improved currency result. Profit before tax from continuing operations increased by €88 million to €1,040 million (previous year: 953). Expenses relating to taxes on income grew by €83 million to €300 million (previous year: 217). As a result, net income from continuing operations rose slightly to €740 million (previous year: 736). Net loss from discontinued operations declined by €29 million to\n€-2 million (previous year: 27). The profit for the period reduced to €737 million (previous year: 762). The profit attributable to non-controlling interests increased to €152 million (previous year: 135). The Group share consequently dropped to €585 million (previous year: 628). Adjusted for acquisition-related charges, the Group share increased to €648 million and EPS increased to €3.39 (previous year: €3.34).\nAt the end of September 2016, the number of employees at HeidelbergCement stood at 61,945 (previous year: 46,772). The increase of 15,173 employees results primarily from the acquisition of Italcementi.\nPremium earned on cost of capital\nAs a result of the acquisition of Italcementi, HeidelbergCement’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) decreased from 7.0% to 6.9%. On the basis of the pro forma result of the past 12 months, HeidelbergCement achieved a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 7.0%, thereby earning a premium on cost of capital already shortly after the acquisition of Italcementi.\nRise in net debt in connection with the acquisition\nNet debt at the end of the third quarter amounted to €8.87 billion, which was around €2.9 billion more than at the end of the same quarter of the previous year. The payment to Italmobiliare of the cash component of the purchase price for the 45% share in Italcementi, the acquisition of a further 4.0% share in Italcementi via the stock exchange, and the takeover of around €2.2 billion of liabilities of the former Italcementi Group contributed to this substantial increase. The net debt-to-equity ratio (gearing) at the end of the third quarter rose accordingly to 53.4% (previous year: 39.0%). Leverage grew to 2.8x, taking into consideration the pro forma operating EBITDA including Italcementi for the preceding 12 months. The liquidity reserve totalled €4.6 billion.\nNet debt and leverage are expected to remain at approximately the same levels at the end of the year. The cash outflows for the purchase of the remaining 51% in Italcementi and the proceeds from the sale of the business activities in Belgium and the USA, as well as cash inflow from operating activities, should roughly offset each other. HeidelbergCement intends to reduce leverage to the target bandwidth of 1.5x to 2.5x as rapidly as possible and is targeting an investment grade rating.\nItalcementi takeover completed\nAs from 12 October 2016, HeidelbergCement is the sole shareholder of Italcementi and has 100% of the share capital. Prior to this, the high acceptance rate for a public takeover bid ending on 30 September 2016 enabled HeidelbergCement to squeeze out the remaining shares straightaway. The Italcementi shares were delisted on 12 October 2016.\nThe sale of assets in Belgium in connection with the Italcementi acquisition was also completed. Closing of the sale of assets in the USA is expected in the coming weeks. Taking also into account the sale of the non-core activities of Italcementi, HeidelbergCement realised proceeds of €1.14 billion, thereby clearly exceeding the target of €1 billion.\nItalcementi integration faster than expected\nIn all key Italcementi country organisations the management was changed and the management philosophy as well as the bonus system of HeidelbergCement was introduced, starting with the takeover of control at the beginning of July. Redundant headquarters on country level were closed and activities concentrated on one location. The synergy implementation is ahead of plan with a €135 million annual run-rate expected by end of 2016. Until the end of October, more than 1,300 jobs were cut, significantly exceeding the initially planned around 500 jobs cuts by the end of 2016. Staff reduction is expected to increase to around 1,500 by the end of 2016. Overall, at least 2,500 jobs will be affected by the restructuring measures. Due to the good progress, HeidelbergCement is convinced to exceed the synergy target of €400 million.\nNew efficiency improvement programs initiated\nTwo new competence centers were established as part of the reorganisation of the Managing Board at the start of the year and the acquisition of Italcementi. The Competence Center RMC – the name reflects the program - aims to increase operational efficiency in ready-mixed concrete and achieve margin improvements of €120 million over a three-year period. Focus lies on optimisations in logistics and mix design. Objective of the “Sales is a Science” program is to further professionalise sales in order to become best in class. The focus is on market intelligence, sales processes and price management. The program is supported by the competence center Global Market Intelligence and Sales Processes.\nOutlook 2016 including Italcementi confirmed\nIn its latest forecast of October 2016, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reduced the growth rate for the global economy in 2016 to 3.1%, a decrease of 0.1 percentage points in comparison with the forecast of April 2016. The lowering of the forecast reflects the anticipated consequences of the considerably increased macroeconomic and political uncertainty following the Brexit decision and slower than expected growth in the USA in the first half of the year. The IMF currently predicts that the growth rate in the industrial countries will drop by 0.5 percentage points in 2016 and rise slightly by 0.2 percentage points in the emerging countries.\nThe risk factors in the development of the global economy include not only the consequences of the Brexit, which are difficult to estimate at present, but also the price trend for oil, the effects of monetary policy measures – particularly those of the US Federal Reserve – on capital flows and exchange rates in the emerging countries, as well as geopolitical risks related to the crises and conflicts in the Middle East and eastern Ukraine.\nIn North America, HeidelbergCement, in conformity with the IMF, expects a continuing economic recovery and consequently a further increase in demand for building materials. In Western and Northern Europe, positive market development is expected. This is based on the continuing solid condition of the German economy, and stable economic growth in Northern Europe and Benelux. So far, we have not yet seen any negative effects of the Brexit decision on demand for building materials in the United Kingdom. In Eastern Europe, we anticipate growing demand for building materials as result of the EU infrastructure programme, among other things. The crisis in eastern Ukraine is continuing to impair the sales volumes and results of the country. The economic situation in Russia and Kazakhstan remains difficult due to the low oil price. In the African markets, we expect a rise in competition besides the continuing growth in demand. In Asia, HeidelbergCement anticipates a general upturn in demand, thanks in particular to increasing infrastructure investments in Indonesia and India. At the same time, the cement capacity and therefore the competition in Indonesia has grown due to the entry of new manufacturers. In China, a further decline in demand and an increase in excess capacities are expected. Repercussions on exports are limited because a large proportion of Chinese capacities is located inland.\nIn view of the overall positive development of demand and the commissioning of new capacities, HeidelbergCement anticipates – both without and including the consolidation of Italcementi (on a pro forma base for 2015 and 2016) – a rise in the sales volumes of the core products cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete.\nExcluding the Italcementi consolidation, HeidelbergCement estimates that the cost base for energy will remain stable in 2016, supposing that energy prices will drop and sales volumes increase throughout the year. A moderate rise in the cost of raw materials and personnel is expected. HeidelbergCement further focuses on the continuous improvement of efficiency and margins. To this end, we started the “Continuous Improvement” programmes in the cement and aggregates business lines to establish a culture of continuous improvement of operational and commercial work processes at employee level. Process optimisations are expected to achieve a sustainable improvement in results of at least €120 million in both business lines over a three-year period. The “CIP” programme for the cement business line started at the beginning of 2015, and the “Aggregates CI” programme was launched at the beginning of 2016. We also continue to optimise our logistics with the “LEO” programme, which has the goal of reducing costs by a total of €150 million over a period of several years. In addition, the “FOX” programme in purchasing is expected to achieve cost savings of around €100 million.\nFor 2016, we expect stable financing costs in consideration of the Italcementi takeover, as the savings in the first half of the year and an increase in financing costs on account of the financing of the purchase price and the takeover of the liabilities of the Italcementi Group in the second half of the year more or less offset each other.\nThe existing forecast for 2016 was confirmed and now applies also including Italcementi; this means, on a comparable pro forma basis*, a moderate increase in revenue and a high single to double-digit increase in operating income are expected.\n“The swift completion of the Italcementi takeover and the rapidly progressing integration give us reason to be very positive about the further development,” explains Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “We are very confident that we can exceed the synergy target of €400 million. Moreover, as part of the integration we have created two new global competence centers for ready-mixed concrete and sales management, which should enhance the margin potential in these areas. Overall, we consider ourselves to be well positioned to successfully advance our strategic priorities: shareholder returns and continuous growth. Our declared aim is still to achieve a solid investment grade rating. In operational terms, we will continue to focus on the four strategic levers: high operating leverage, maintenance of cost leadership, pronounced vertical integration, and optimal geographical positioning. In this way, we will increase our efficiency and the satisfaction of our customers, especially in the world’s rapidly growing metropolitan areas. Our global programmes to optimise costs and processes and to increase margins will once again be consistently pursued in 2016. These include, in particular, the Continuous Improvement Programmes for the aggregates (“Aggregates CI”) and cement (“CIP”) business lines, as well as “FOX” for purchasing.”\n“The outlook for the global economy is positive, even though the macroeconomic and political risks have increased following the Brexit decision,” adds Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “HeidelbergCement will continue to benefit from the good and stable economic development in the industrial countries, above all in the USA, Germany, Northern Europe, and Australia. With the acquisition of Italcementi, we have strengthened our global market position. In our core business lines aggregates, cement, and ready-mixed concrete, we occupy first, second, and third place globally. In the next few years, we intend to consistently develop the characteristics that set HeidelbergCement apart from the competition: cost leadership and operational excellence. At the same time, we plan to achieve a sustainable level of earnings power for shareholders that is unprecedented in the Group.”\nOverview of the HeidelbergCement Group January-September 2016\nKey financial figures\nJanuary-September\nQ3\n€m\n2015\n2016\nVariance\nLike-for- like\n2015\n2016\nVariance\nLike-for- like\nSales volumes\nCement (Mt)\n60,580\n73,047\n21%\n3%\n21,802\n33,153\n52%\n2%\nAggregates (Mt)\n185,987\n198,687\n7%\n1%\n72,582\n80,309\n11%\n-1%\nReady-mixed concrete (Mm\n)\n27,123\n30,405\n12%\n1%\n9,704\n12,483\n29%\n0%\nAsphalt (Mt)\n6,920\n7,071\n2%\n2%\n2,882\n3,115\n8%\n8%\nIncome statement\nRevenue\n10,076\n10,927\n8%\n0%\n3,606\n4,520\n25%\n-2%\nOperating income before depreciation (OIBD)\n1,916\n2,121\n11%\n6%\n865\n1,009\n17%\n1%\nin % of revenue\n19.0%\n19.4%\n24.0%\n22.3%\nOperating income\n1,347\n1,477\n10%\n8%\n675\n738\n9%\n1%\nProfit before tax from continuing operations\n953\n1,040\n9%\n546\n533\n-3%\nGroup share of profit\n628\n585\n-7%\n479\n339\n-29%\nEarnings per share in € (IAS 33)\n3.34\n3.06\n-8%\n2.55\n1.75\n-31%\nAdjusted earnings per share in €\n3.34\n3.39\n0.05\n2.55\n2.08\n-0.47\nStatement of cash flows and balance sheet\nCash flow from operating activities\n537\n762\n225\n552\n548\n-3\nInvestments (cash outflow)\n-631\n-1,699\n-1,069\n-225\n-1,256\n-1,031\nNet debt\n5,970\n8,868\n2,898\nGearing\n39.0%\n53.4%\n\nAdjusted for currency and consolidation effects\nAttributable to parent entity\nExcluding restructuring costs of €63 million\nPro forma key financial figures\nJanuary-September\nQ3\n€m\n2015\n2016\nVariance\nLike-for- like\n2015\n2016\nVariance\nLike-for- like\nSales volumes\nCement (Mt)\n90,775\n94,187\n4%\n4%\n31,525\n33,153\n5%\n5%\nAggregates (Mt)\n207,799\n214,144\n3%\n2%\n79,745\n80,309\n1%\n-1%\nReady-mixed concrete (Mm\n)\n35,054\n35,705\n2%\n1%\n12,256\n12,483\n2%\n1%\nAsphalt (Mt)\n6,920\n7,071\n2%\n2%\n2,882\n3,115\n8%\n8%\nIncome statement\nRevenue\n12,973\n12,825\n-1%\n1%\n4,531\n4,520\n0%\n1%\nOperating income before depreciation (OIBD)\n2,336\n2,396\n3%\n6%\n996\n1,009\n1%\n2%\nin % of revenue\n18.0%\n18.7%\n22.0%\n22.3%\nOperating income\n1,507\n1,585\n5%\n10%\n716\n738\n3%\n4%\n\nAdjusted for currency and consolidation effects and excluding CO2 gains:\n2015 €m 50 (Q1: €m 21; Q2: €m 29)\n2016 €m 17 (Q1: €m 17)\n18,500 characters\nFinancial Calendar","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2016-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","title":"HeidelbergCement Publishes Q3 2016 Results","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Other","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/pr-08-11-2016","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":7239,"text":"On Wednesday, 10 May 2017, at the Kongresshaus Stadthalle Heidelberg, Germany\nIn his speech to about 340 shareholders, Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board, offered a look back at HeidelbergCement’s successful development in 2016. The acquisition of Italcementi has clearly strengthened HeidelbergCement. The combination created the global market leader in aggregates, the second largest producer of cement and the global number three in ready-mixed concrete. Revenue, result from current operations, cash flow, and profit for the financial year adjusted for non-recurring effects increased significantly with the consolidation of Italcementi since 1 July 2016. In addition, HeidelbergCement has earned a premium on the costs of capital also in the year of the acquisition. The integration of Italcementi is progressing faster than expected and the synergy target was increased: Annual run-rate synergies of €470 million should now be realised by 2018 compared with €400 million planned before. The strategic priorities of shareholder returns and continuous growth are clearly reflected in the considerably increased dividend.\nDue to the strengthened business profile after the Italcementi acquisition and an improved creditworthiness, HeidelbergCement has been assigned an investment grade rating by the rating agencies Moody’s Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Rating. Thereby, the company has achieved a core strategic target and is very well positioned to benefit from improved financing conditions. Despite the financing of the acquisition of Italcementi, the financial result in 2016 was already improved considerably.\nIn the last 12 months, HeidelbergCement was able to further enlarge its shareholder structure and gain long-term interested investors as shareholders. In the year 2016, the HeidelbergCement share price developed very positively and outperformed the DAX for the third year in a row.\nOutlook confirmed for 2017\nDr. Bernd Scheifele also reported on the results and developments in the first quarter of 2017, and confirmed the outlook for the remainder of the year given at the publication of the 2016 annual results in March 2017. “We continued our strong operational development in the first quarter of 2017,” said Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “We remain cautiously optimistic about 2017 and are well positioned globally to achieve our strategic goals – continuous growth and sustainable returns for our shareholders.”\nAnnual General Meeting approved dividend increase by a significant majority\nThe Annual General Meeting has approved the proposal of the administration to increase the dividend by 23% to €1.60 with a substantial majority of 99.86%. “With the strong increase in dividend payment, we consistently implement our progressive dividend strategy and share our successful business development with our shareholders,” explained Dr. Bernd Scheifele.\nOf the company’s € 595.2 million in subscribed share capital, 75.50% were represented.\nAbout HeidelbergCement\nHeidelbergCement is one of the world’s largest integrated manufacturers of building materials with leading market positions in aggregates, cement, and ready-mixed concrete.

{"id":7242,"text":"## German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) funds the project, named „CO2MIN“, with three million euros.  During the three-year research project „CO2MIN“, HeidelbergCement and RWTH Aachen University (RWTH Aachen) will explore the absorption of CO2 from flue gas by the minerals olivine and basalt. In the future, the carbonised minerals could be used as a value-added additive in the production of building materials. HeidelbergCement and RWTH are supported by the Potsdam Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) and the Dutch start-up Green Minerals. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is funding the project, which began on 1 June 2017, with a sum of three million euros.  The natural minerals olivine and basalt are able to bind CO2 over their entire life-cycle. With natural absorption, it takes decades until the minerals are saturated with the greenhouse gas. The research project intends to speed up the absorption process. If successful, carbonised minerals can be used for various product applications.  The use of CO2 as a raw material has high priority in the climate strategy of HeidelbergCement. \"We are already reducing the CO2 emissions of our plants very successfully by using alternative fuels and raw materials and by optimising the efficiency of our kilns,\" explains Jan Theulen, Director of Alternative Resources at HeidelbergCement. \"In order to reduce CO2 emissions even further in the future, we have to develop and test new approaches. One of them is the binding of CO2 by minerals.\"  In the first year the research focuses on the investigation of different minerals in small-scale experiments. The carbonation of the most suitable minerals will be tested under realistic process conditions in the following year. The experiments will be conducted by the institute of Process Metallurgy and Metal Recycling (IME), which also is the coordinator of the RWTH group. Life-cycle assessments (RWTH) as well as analyses of economic aspects and social acceptance (IASS) complete this project phase. In the third year, marketability and acceptance will be further optimised through intensive cooperation with customers.  ###### About HeidelbergCement  HeidelbergCement is one of the world’s largest integrated manufacturers of building materials with leading market positions in aggregates, cement, and ready-mixed concrete.

{"id":7244,"text":"* #### Specific net CO2 emissions reduced by 22.6% (base year: 1990)    * #### Platform for sustainable supplier management launched in pilot countries      ​Today, HeidelbergCement has published its eighth Sustainability Report so far. The Sustainability Report 2016 was prepared in accordance with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G4) and summarises important topics and challenges for HeidelbergCement in its drive for sustainable development. The report focuses on targets, measures and achievements of the company’s sustainability management.  ###### Successes in occupational safety and climate protection  The health and safety of its employees is central to the HeidelbergCement Sustainability Ambitions. In 2016, HeidelbergCement was able to reduce the accident frequency rate as well as the severity rate. “HeidelbergCement will continue to invest in trainings and awareness campaigns for occuprational safety in order to reduce accidents to a minimum. Moreover, we will give the adherence to Group-wide safety standards highest priority,” said Dr. Bernd Scheifele, CEO of HeidelbergCement.  Climate protection and the reduction of CO2 emissions remained another focus of our sustainability management in 2016. For instance, specific net carbon dioxide emissions were reduced by 22.6% (compared to 1990 levels) to 598 kg per tonne of cement. This was partly due to a significant increase of the use of alternative fuels at a number of plants throughout the Group. For example, the Gorazdze cement plant in Poland achieved an alternative fuel rate of 70%. “The numbers show that HeidelbergCement made progress in 2016,” said Scheifele. “We aim to further decrease our CO2 emissions. Therefore, we are conducting intensive research in future-oriented technologies to use CO2 as a resource.”  ###### Sustainable supplier management  At HeidelbergCement, corporate responsibility for the environment and society is not limited to our own production processes, but also encompasses the supply chain. Group-wide procurement guidelines therefore provide clear instructions regarding supplier relationships and procurement activities. In 2016, HeidelbergCement made significant progress regarding the systematic management and assessment of its suppliers. An online platform, that has already been introduced in several countries, will simplify the systematic recording and consolidation of supplier data as well as its assessment in accordance with selected sustainability aspects.  ###### About HeidelbergCement  HeidelbergCement is one of the world’s largest integrated manufacturers of building materials with leading market positions in aggregates, cement, and ready-mixed concrete.

{"id":7245,"text":"### Italcementi acquisition strengthens sales volumes, revenue, and result    * Sales volumes: 33 million tonnes of cement (+47%); 81 million tonnes of aggregates (+18%); 12 million cubic metres of ready-mixed concrete (+22%)    * Revenue up by 29% to €4.6 billion (previous year: €3.6 billion)   * Result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation improved by 22% to €964 million (previous year: € 791 million)   * Financial result increased by €8 million to €-99 million (previous year: €-107 million)   * Earnings per share improved by 7% to €1.80   * In the first half of 2017, Group share of profit increased by 17% to €288 million   * Synergy target of €175 million for 2017 already achieved in June    ### Outlook for 2017 unchanged    * Positive outlook for global economy; higher geopolitical and macroeconomic risks   * Growth in sales volumes of cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete expected   * Moderate increase in revenue and mid-single to double-digit percentage increase in result from current operations on a comparable pro forma basis*; significant rise in profit for the financial year before non-recurring effects   * HeidelbergCement is well positioned to benefit from good and stable development in industrial countries, particularly in the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia    *Comparable pro forma basis: with the inclusion of Italcementi in the first half of 2016 and adjusted for currency and consolidation effects  ### Q2 sales volumes benefit from consolidation of Italcementi  In the second quarter, the sales volumes of HeidelbergCement’s building materials rose substantially as a result of the consolidation of Italcementi. On a pro forma basis, i.e. taking into account Italcementi’s deliveries in the same period of the previous year, sales volumes declined slightly. Growth in sales volumes was impaired by fewer working days due to Easter and the end of Ramadan as well as rainy weather, especially in the South, Northeast and Midwest of the USA.  The Group’s cement and clinker sales volumes increased by 47% to 32.8 million tonnes (previous year: 22.3) as a result of the acquisition. On a pro forma basis, sales volumes declined slightly by 1%. The strongest increase on a pro forma basis was recorded in North America followed by Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia as well as Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin. In Asia-Pacific, cement sales volumes declined due to festivities at the end of Ramadan in June and the resulting fewer selling days in Indonesia. Sales volumes in North Africa decreased accordingly. This decline was more than offset by the significant growth in sales volumes in the countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  Deliveries of aggregates also registered an acquisition-related rise of 18% to 81.4 million tonnes (previous year: 69.1). Taking into account Italcementi’s deliveries in the same period of the previous year, the growth amounts to 5%. Higher sales volumes in all Group areas, excluding Western and Southern Europe and North America, and particularly the consolidation of the Mibau Group in Northern Europe contributed to this increase.  Deliveries of ready-mixed concrete also rose as a result of the consolidations by 22% to 12.2 million cubic metres (previous year: 10.0). On a pro forma basis, sales volumes fell by 6%. Asphalt sales volumes declined by 5% to 2.4 million tonnes (previous year: 2.6).  In the first half of 2017, cement and clinker sales volumes rose as a result of the consolidation by 52% to 60.7 million tonnes (previous year: 39.9). Deliveries of aggregates climbed by 20% to 142.3 million tonnes (previous year: 118.4) and of ready-mixed concrete rose by 26% to 22.6 million cubic metres (previous year: 17.9). Asphalt sales volumes fell slightly by 1% to 3.9 million tonnes (previous year: 4.0).  On a pro forma basis, cement and clinker sales volumes declined slightly by 1%. Deliveries of aggregates increased by 6%, whereas deliveries of ready-mixed concrete declined by 4%.  ### Accelerated growth of revenue and result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation due to the Italcementi acquisition  As a result of the consolidation of Italcementi, revenue and result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation increased significantly. Group revenue rose by 29% in the second quarter to €4,611 million (previous year: 3,575). The result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation improved by 22% to €964 million (previous year: 791). After depreciation and amortisation, the result from current operations rose by 14% to €683 million (previous year: 601).  On pro forma basis, revenue increased slightly. The result from current operations before and after depreciation and amortisation, however, declined slightly by 1% and 3%, respectively. Cost inflation and a decline in sales volumes due to fewer working days as well as bad weather were almost offset by successful price increases and the realisation of synergies. In California, weather-related production problems prevented a more significant improvement in results. The results in the emerging countries of Asia and Africa were significantly below prior year due to a sharp drop in prices in Indonesia, Thailand and Ghana and the weakening of the Egyptian Pound. In Northern and Eastern Europe, however, the positive development continued.  “In the light of the difficult general conditions, we achieved a good result in the second quarter,” says Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board. “We were able to almost offset the effect of higher energy costs, bad weather conditions, fewer working days, and increased competition in some emerging countries. The synergies from the Italcementi acquisition are clearly visible in the results. Thanks to the ongoing refinancing of our maturities at more favourable terms, we could further improve the financial result and thereby make an important contribution to the further rise in our cash flow. All in all, we have again increased the Group share of profit for the period despite the challenging environment.”  The additional ordinary result decreased by €8 million to €-20 million (previous year: -12). The financial result improved by €8 million to €-99 million (previous year: -107). Net interest expenses were reduced by €17 million. In contrast, the currency result and other financial result developed slightly negatively.  The profit before tax from continuing operations increased by €92 million to €585 million (previous year: 493). Expenses relating to income taxes rose significantly by €81 million to €176 million (previous year: 95) due to the first-time consolidation of Italcementi and a non-recurring effect in Indonesia in the prior year. Normalisation of tax expenses is expected by the end of the year. Net income from continuing operations increased to €409 million (previous year: 398). The net loss from discontinued operations remained stable at €-12 million and represents operations of the Hanson Group that were discontinued in previous years.  The profit for the period rose to €397million (previous year: 385). The profit relating to non-controlling interests fell by around €28 million to €39 million (previous year: 67) mainly due to a weaker result in Indonesia. The Group share of profit consequently improved by 12% to €358 million (previous year: 318) and earnings per share rose to €1.80 (previous year: 1.69).  In the first half of the year, Group revenue rose significantly by 31% to €8,394 million (previous year: 6,407) as a result of the consolidation. Result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation improved by 21% to €1,347 million (previous year: 1,112) and after depreciation and amortisation it rose by 7% to €791 million (previous year: 739). On a comparable pro forma basis*, revenue increased slightly compared to the previous year's level. Result from current operations before and after depreciation and amortisation declined slightly by 1% and 4%, respectively. The additional ordinary result declined by €20 million to €-36 million (previous year: -16), mainly due to expenses from the disposal of subsidiaries, integration costs, as well as other non-recurring income and expenses. The financial result improved by €40 million to €-181 million (previous year: -221), particularly due to a reduction in interest expenses and an improved other financial result. Profit before tax from continuing operations increased by €87 million to €594 million (previous year: 507). Expenses relating to income taxes increased by €93 million to €224 million (previous year: 131). As a result, net income from continuing operations declined slightly to €370 million (previous year: 376). Net loss from discontinued operations improved by €14 million to €-8 million (previous year: -22). The profit for the period rose to €362 million (previous year: 354). The profit attributable to non-controlling interests declined to €74 million (previous year: 108). The Group share of profit therefore improved to €288 million (previous year: 246) and earnings per share rose to €1.45 (previous year: 1.31).  At the end of the second quarter of 2017, the number of employees at HeidelbergCement stood at 60,993 (previous year: 46,632). The increase of 14,361 employees is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Italcementi.  ### Refinancing on favourable terms continued  In the second quarter, HeidelbergCement repaid a bond of €500 million with a coupon of 4.75%. A new ten-year bond of €500 million with a fixed coupon of 1.5% was placed for refinancing purposes. Owing to its investment grade credit rating and the low interest environment, HeidelbergCement is able to refinance its maturities on substantially more favourable terms, thereby improving the interest result and cash flow.  Net debt at the end of the second quarter amounted to €10.1 billion, which was around €4.3 billion more than at the end of the same quarter of the previous year as a result of the acquisition. The rise in net debt compared to the end of the first quarter is mainly due to a rise in working capital following strong business activities in May and June as well as higher investments due to the acquisition of operations in the Northwest of the USA. Gearing (net debt-to-equity ratio) at the end of the second quarter rose correspondingly to 62.3% (previous year: 38.1). Leverage (net debt-to-result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation ratio) increased to 3.2x (previous year: 2.2x). We confirm our target of bringing leverage back down to around 2.5x or less by the end of the year and we expect a reduction of net debt based on a strong cash flow in the second half of 2017. The liquidity reserve fell from €5.4 billion to €4.4 billion. At the end of the same quarter of the previous year, the liquidity reserve was exceptionally high due to the prefinancing of the Italcementi acquisition.  ### Integration of Italcementi is progressing well  The implementation of the measures to integrate Italcementi is still progressing well. In North America, the operational margin of the acquired plants was already significantly increased. The synergy target for 2017 of €175 million was already achieved in the first half year. We are confident to reach total synergies of around €500 million.  ### Outlook for 2017 confirmed  In its latest forecast from July 2017, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continues to expect a rise in global economic growth from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.5% in 2017. Beside accelerating growth in the USA, an improved economic outlook for the Eurozone and increasing growth rates of the emerging markets are drivers behind this trend. Higher growth rates are particularly expected for the countries in Africa south of the Sahara and in the countries of Eastern Europe.  Global risks have increased considerably compared with the previous year. This relates both to geopolitical and macroeconomic risks. Among the geopolitical risks are notably the conflicts in the Middle East and in eastern Ukraine. In terms of macroeconomic risks, special mention must be made of an increase in energy prices and inflation, the unpredictable consequences of a downturn in the Chinese economy, the impact of monetary policy measures, particularly by the US Federal Reserve, and the shift of political measures towards protectionism.  In North America, HeidelbergCement, in conformity with the IMF, expects a stronger economic recovery and consequently a further increase in demand for building materials. In Western and Southern Europe, positive market development is expected. This is based on the continued recovery in the United Kingdom, the consistent solid condition of the German economy, and the stable economic development in Benelux. In Northern Europe, we expect a continuation of the good market conditions. In Eastern Europe, we anticipate growing demand for building materials as a result of the EU infrastructure programme, among other factors. The crisis in eastern Ukraine is continuing to impair the country’s sales volumes and result. The economic situation in Russia and Kazakhstan has improved following the increase in the oil price. In the African markets, we expect an acceleration in demand growth together with a persistent level of competition. In Asia, HeidelbergCement anticipates an upturn in demand, thanks in particular to increasing infrastructure investments in Indonesia. Nevertheless, a further decline in demand and an increase in excess capacities are expected in China. The impact on export volumes is limited, however, because a large proportion of Chinese capacities is located inland.  In view of the overall positive development of demand, HeidelbergCement still projects increasing sales volumes of the core products cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete.  HeidelbergCement estimates that the cost base for energy will increase moderately in 2017 as a result of the rising oil and coal prices since the beginning of 2016. A slight to moderate rise in the cost of raw materials and personnel is expected. HeidelbergCement remains focused on the continuous improvement of efficiency and margins. With this in mind, we are implementing “Continuous Improvement” programmes in the cement and aggregates business lines to establish a culture of consistent advancement of operational and commercial work processes at employee level. Process optimisations are expected to achieve a sustainable improvement in results of at least €120 million in both business lines over a three-year period. The “CIP” programme for the cement business line commenced at the beginning of 2015, and the “Aggregates CI” programme for the aggregates business line was introduced at the beginning of 2016. We also continue to optimise our logistics with the “LEO” programme, which has the goal of reducing costs by €150 million over a period of several years. In addition, we launched the new efficiency improvement programme “Competence Center Readymix” (CCR) in the ready-mixed concrete business at the end of 2016. Over a three-year period, the optimisation of logistics and concrete recipes is expected to achieve an improvement in result of €120 million.  In 2017, we anticipate a significant decrease in financing costs on account of our disciplined cash flow management and the refinancing of maturities on more favourable terms.  On the basis of these assumptions, the Managing Board has set the goal for 2017 of increasing revenue moderately and the result from current operations before exchange rate and consolidation effects by a mid-single to double-digit percentage on a pro forma basis – i.e. taking into account the contributions of Italcementi for the first half of 2016 – as well as significantly improving the profit for the financial year before non-recurring effects.  “We have seen a clear upward trend since Easter and expect a significantly stronger development in the second half of the year,” explains Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “We confirm our outlook for 2017. Strategically, we will maintain our focus on concluding the integration of Italcementi and reducing net debt through disciplined cash flow management. Our declared aim is to maintain a long-term investment grade rating. We will focus our investments on projects which strengthen our market position and offer synergy potential. In operational terms, we further concentrate on the following five areas: increase in customer satisfaction, high operating leverage, cost leadership, vertical integration, and optimised geographical positioning. As a result, we will increase our efficiency and the satisfaction level of our customers, especially in the world’s rapidly growing metropolitan areas. We will continue to drive forward our global programmes to optimise costs and processes. Furthermore, we will deal more intensively with potentials arising from the digitisation of our value chain.”  “We remain cautiously optimistic about 2017,” continues Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “While the overall outlook for the global economy is positive, major macroeconomic and particularly geopolitical risks remain. HeidelbergCement will benefit from the good and stable economic development in the industrial countries, above all in the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia. These countries generate more than 60% of our revenue. With the acquisition of Italcementi and its rapid integration, we have impressively demonstrated our tremendous business potential and strong momentum. From a global perspective, we are well positioned to achieve our strategic goals – continuous growth and sustainable returns for our shareholders.”  ### Overview of the HeidelbergCement Group January to June 2017  Key financial figures (reported)  | January-June| Q2   ---|---|---      €m  | 2016| 2017| Variance| 2016| 2017| Variance   Sales volumes   Cement (Mt)| 39,894| 60,660| 52%| 22,293| 32,844| 47%   Aggregates (Mt)| 118,378| 142,304| 20%| 69,077| 81,449| 18%   Ready-mixed concrete (Mm3)| 17,922| 22,620| 26%| 9,960| 12,197| 23%   Asphalt (Mt)| 3,956| 3,905| -1%| 2,575| 2,442| -5%   Income statement   Revenue| 6,407| 8,394| 31%| 3,575| 4,611| 29%   Result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation| 1,112| 1,347| 21%| 791| 964| 22%   in % of revenue| 17.4%| 16.1%| | 22.1%| 20.9%|    Result from current operations| 739| 791| 7%| 601| 683| 14%   Profit before tax from continuing operations| 354| 362| 2%| 385| 397| 3%   Group share of profit| 246| 288| 17%| 318| 358| 12%   Earnings per share in € (IAS 33) 1)| 1.31| 1.45| 11%| 1.69| 1.80| 7%   Statement of cash flows and balance sheet   Cash flow from operating activities| 214| -132| -345| 475| 354| -122   Investments (cash outflow)| -444| -520| -76| -187| -325| -138   Net debt| 5,865| 10,140| 4,275| | |    Gearing| 38.1%| 62.3%| | | |       1) Attributable to the shareholders of HeidelbergfCement AG      Pro forma key financial figures1)  | January-June| Q2   ---|---|---   €m| 2016| 2017| Vari-ance| Like-for- like2)| 2016| 2017| Vari-ance| Like-for- like2   Sales volumes   Cement (Mt)| 61,061| 60,660| -1%| -1%| 33,246| 32,844| -1%| -1%   Aggregates (Mt)| 133,759| 142,304| 6%| 1%| 77,376| 81,449| 5%| 0%   Ready-mixed concrete (Mm3)| 23,503| 22,620| -4%| -4%| 12,930| 12,197| -6%| -6%   Asphalt (Mt)| 3,956| 3,905| -1%| -1%| 2,575| 2,442| -5%| -5%   Income statement   Revenue| 8,326| 8,394| 1%| 0%| 4,583| 4,611| 1%| 0%   Result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation| 1,368| 1,347| -2%| -1%| 977| 964| -1%| -1%   in % of revenue| 16.4%| 16.1%| | | 21.3%| 20.9%| |    Result from current operations| 828| 791| -5%| -4%| 704| 683| -3%| -2%      1) Including Italcementi in the first half year 2016   2) Adjusted for currency and consolidation effects and excluding CO2 gains of €17 million in Q2 2016      16,200 characters  Financial calendar","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2017-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"HeidelbergCement reports results for the second quarter of 2017","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Finance","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/pr-01-08-2017","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

The strongest growth recorded Australia, Morocco, India, as well as the markets in Northern and Eastern Europe. The countries in Southern Europe showed clear signs of recovery. While Germany achieved significant growth, the uncertainties regarding Brexit negatively affected sales volumes and results in the United Kingdom. The weak markets in some emerging countries, such as Ghana, Indonesia, Thailand, and Egypt, have passed their lowest point. Indonesia and Ghana show again clear signs of recovery of demand.  During the third quarter, the Group’s cement and clinker sales volumes grew by 2% to 33.7 million tonnes (previous year: 33.2). The strongest growth was achieved in the Asia-Pacific Group area, followed by Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin and Western and Southern Europe.  Deliveries of aggregates rose by 8% to 86.7 million tonnes (previous year: 80.3). Higher sales volumes in all Group areas, excluding Western and Southern Europe, and particularly the consolidation of the Mibau Group in Northern Europe contributed to this increase, as did the Pacific Northwest Materials Business taken over from CEMEX in the USA.  Deliveries of ready-mixed concrete fell by 0.5% to 12.4 million cubic metres (previous year: 12.5). Asphalt sales volumes grew by 3% to 3.2 million tonnes (previous year: 3.1).  In the first nine months of the year, cement and clinker sales volumes rose by 29% to 94.4 million tonnes (previous year: 73.0) owing to the consolidation of Italcementi. Deliveries of aggregates climbed by 15% to 229.0 million tonnes (previous year: 198.7) and deliveries of ready-mixed concrete also rose by 15% to 35.0 million cubic metres (previous year: 30.4). Asphalt sales volumes grew slightly to 7.1 million tonnes (previous year: 7.1).  On a pro forma basis**, cement and clinker sales volumes showed a marginal increase. Deliveries of aggregates rose by 7%, while deliveries of ready-mixed concrete fell by 3%.  ### Revenue and results continue to grow  Group revenue rose by 2% in the third quarter to €4,610 million (previous year: 4,520). On a comparable basis, which means excluding consolidation and exchange rate effects, it even increased by 4%. This primarily reflects the pleasing development of sales volumes as well as price increases in order to offset inflation. Exchange rate effects reduced revenue by €193 million.  The result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation improved by 5% to €1,058 million (previous year: 1,009). After depreciation and amortisation, the result from current operations grew by 7% to €787 million (previous year: 738). On a comparable basis*, the rise in result from current operations before and after depreciation and amortisation amounted to 7% and 8%, respectively. Besides the growth in sales volumes and price increases in important core markets, the realisation of synergies in particular and an efficient cost management also made a contribution to the positive development of results.  “As expected, the positive trend reversal in May led to a significantly improved development of results in the third quarter”, says Chairman of the Managing Board, Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “North America, Australia, Morocco, India, as well as Northern and Eastern Europe have developed very strongly. The countries of Southern Europe are showing clear signs of recovery, and the emerging countries have passed their lowest point. We have succeeded in reducing the rise in energy costs through the flexible use of various fuels. Synergies from the acquisition of Italcementi have already significantly exceeded the target for 2017. Furthermore, the refinancing of our maturities on favourable terms has made a clear impact on both result and cash flow. All in all, we have substantially increased the Group share of profit for the period and earnings per share. In this way, we clearly show that we are able to create value for our shareholders from the Italcementi takeover.”  The additional ordinary result increased by €76 million to €-6 million (previous year: -81). The previous year’s figure included significantly higher acquisition-related extraordinary expenses. The financial result improved by €38 million to €-104 million (previous year: -142). Net interest expenses were reduced by around €25 million due to favourable refinancing.  Group share of profit improved significantly by 42% to €481 million (previous year: 339) and the earnings per share by 38% to €2.42 (previous year: 1.75).  In the first nine months of the year, Group revenue rose considerably by 19% to €13.0 billion (previous year: 10.9) as a result of the consolidation. The result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation improved by 13% to €2,405 million (previous year: 2,121); after depreciation and amortisation, it rose by 7% to €1,578 million (previous year: 1,477). On a comparable pro forma basis**, revenue exceeded the previous year’s level by 1%. The result from current operations before and after depreciation and amortisation increased slightly by 1%. The additional ordinary result improved by €56 million to €-42 million (previous year: -98). The financial result increased by €78 million to €-285 million (previous year: -363), particularly because of a reduction in interest expenses. Expenses relating to taxes on income increased by €100 million to €400 million (previous year: 300) owing to the first-time consolidation of the Italcementi Group and a non-recurring effect in Indonesia in the previous year. The Group share of profit grew considerably by 31% to €768 million (previous year: 585) and the earnings per share to €3.87 (previous year: 3.06).  At the end of September 2017, the number of employees at HeidelbergCement stood at 60,830 (previous year: 61,945). The decrease of 1,115 employees essentially results from two opposing developments. On the one hand, more than 2,400 jobs were cut across the Group – firstly, as part of the realisation of synergies in former Italcementi subsidiaries and, secondly, in connection with efficiency increases in sales and administration as well as location optimisations. On the other hand, the headcount grew by around 700 as a result of the full consolidation of the Mibau Group and the acquisition of construction activities from Cemex in the northwest of the USA as well as the business operations of the Saunders Companies in the US state of New York. Furthermore, there was an increase of a little over 600 employees in some countries in the Group areas of Western and Southern Europe, Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia, and in particular in Australia as a result of the solid market development and the insourcing of truck drivers.  ### Free cash flow significantly improved  In the past 12 months, HeidelbergCement generated a free cash flow of €1.2 billion due to its strong operating performance, an improved working capital, and lower interest payments. As a consequence, net debt could be reduced by almost €500 million to €9.6 billion compared with the end of the previous quarter. Compared with the same quarter of the previous year, net debt was around €800 million higher, as a result of the acquisition. Gearing (net debt-to-equity ratio) at the end of the third quarter rose to 59.4% (previous year: 53.6). Leverage (net debt-to-result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation ratio) increased to 3.0x (previous year: 2.8x). We confirm our goal of decreasing leverage back down to 2.5x by the year end and anticipate a further strengthening of cash flow through disciplined capital expenditure and sale of non-core assets.  ### Very successful integration of Italcementi  The implementation of the measures to integrate Italcementi is continuing to progress well. In North America, the operating margin in the acquired plants has already increased markedly. At €254 million, the synergy target for 2017 of €175 million has already been significantly exceeded after just nine months. We are confident that we can reach the 2018 target already at the end of 2017. Due to our many years of experience with the integration of companies, we were able to limit considerably the costs for restructuring and integration. Besides the achieved operating improvements, we significantly reduced refinancing costs, and benefit from the sale of non-core assets. Overall, the acquisition of Italcementi will have a clearly positive impact on earnings per share already in 2017.  ### HeidelbergCement renews its commitment to sustainability  In October, HeidelbergCement renewed its commitment to sustainability with the publication of the Sustainability Commitments 2030. Focus of the company is on six key areas of action aiming at actively supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Climate protection is a particularly important issue for our industry. HeidelbergCement is committed to fulfill its share to limit global temperature rise to less than 2°C. In line with the objective agreed in Paris, HeidelbergCement aims to reduce specific CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030 (compared to 1990). The company has a leading role in large research projects to avoid CO2 emissions or use them as raw material, such as the carbonation of concrete in the recycling process.  ### Outlook for 2017 confirmed  In its latest forecast from October 2017, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) anticipates a stronger rise in global economic growth from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.6% (July forecast: 3.5%) in 2017. Accelerating growth in Europe and Canada and increasing growth rates in the emerging countries are the drivers behind this trend. Higher growth rates are expected in particular for the countries of Eastern Europe as well as the ASEAN-5 countries.  Global risks have increased considerably compared with the previous year. This relates both to geopolitical and macroeconomic risks. Among the geopolitical risks, the conflicts in the Middle East and in eastern Ukraine are especially noteworthy. In terms of macroeconomic risks, special mention must be made of the unpredictable consequences of a downturn in the Chinese economy, the impact of monetary policy measures, particularly by the US Federal Reserve, and the shift of political measures towards protectionism.  In North America, HeidelbergCement, in conformity with the IMF, expects a stronger economic recovery and consequently a further increase in demand for building materials. In Western and Southern Europe, positive market development is expected. This is based on the consistent solid condition of the German economy, the stable economic development in Benelux, and the beginning recovery in Southern Europe. For Northern Europe, we expect the strong market conditions to continue. In Eastern Europe, we anticipate growing demand for building materials as a result of the EU infrastructural programme, among other factors. The crisis in eastern Ukraine is continuing to impair the country’s sales volumes and result. The economic situation in Russia and Kazakhstan has improved following the increase in the oil price. In the African markets, we expect an acceleration in demand growth together with a persistent level of competition. In Asia, HeidelbergCement anticipates an upturn in demand, thanks in particular to increasing infrastructure investments in Indonesia. In China, we expect a continued market recovery supported by stable macroeconomics and government mandated production stops.  In view of the overall positive development of demand, HeidelbergCement continues to project increasing sales volumes of the core products cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete.  HeidelbergCement estimates that the cost base for energy will increase moderately in 2017 as a result of the rise in oil and coal prices since the beginning of 2016. A slight to moderate rise in the cost of raw materials and personnel is also expected. HeidelbergCement remains focused on the continuous improvement of efficiency and margins. With this in mind, we are implementing Continuous Improvement programmes in the cement and aggregates business lines to establish a culture of consistent advancement of operational and commercial work processes at employee level. Process optimisations are expected to achieve a sustainable improvement in results of at least €120 million in both business lines over a three-year period. The CIP programme for the cement business commenced at the beginning of 2015, and the Aggregates CI programme for the aggregates business line was introduced at the start of 2016. We also continue to optimise our logistics with the LEO programme, which has the goal of reducing costs by €150 million over a period of several years. In addition, we launched the new efficiency improvement programme Competence Center Readymix (CCR) in the ready-mixed concrete business at the end of 2016. Over a three-year period, the optimisation of logistics and concrete formulations is expected to achieve an improvement in result of €120 million.  In 2017, we anticipate a significant decrease in financing costs on account of our disciplined cash flow management and the refinancing of maturities on more favourable terms.  On the basis of these assumptions, the Managing Board maintains unchanged the goal for 2017 of increasing revenue moderately and the result from current operations before exchange rate and consolidation effects by a mid-single to double-digit percentage rate on a pro forma basis – i.e. taking into account the contributions of Italcementi for the first half of 2016 – as well as significantly improving the profit for the financial year before non-recurring effects.  As a consequence of our disciplined capital spending, we reduce our cash-relevant investments planned for 2017 from €1.4 billion to €1.2 billion. The reduction relates only to investments in growth.  “The result for the third quarter confirms our expectations for the full year”, states Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “From a strategic perspective, we will maintain our focus on concluding the integration of Italcementi and reducing net debt through disciplined cash flow management and the sale of non-core assets. Our declared aim remains to achieve a long-term investment grade rating. We will focus our investments on projects that strengthen our market position and offer synergy potential. In operational terms, we will continue to concentrate on these five areas: an increase in customer satisfaction, high operating leverage, cost leadership, vertical integration, and optimised geographical positioning. As a result, we will increase our efficiency and the satisfaction level of our customers, especially in the world’s rapidly growing metropolitan areas. We will continue to drive forward our global programmes to optimise costs and processes as well as focus more strongly on the potential presented by the digitisation of our value chain.”  “While the overall outlook for the global economy is positive, substantial macroeconomic and particularly geopolitical risks continue to exist at the same time”, continues Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “HeidelbergCement will benefit from the good and stable economic development in the industrial countries, above all in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. These countries generate more than 60% of our revenue. With the acquisition of Italcementi and its rapid integration, we have impressively demonstrated our tremendous business potential and strong momentum. From a global perspective, we are well positioned to achieve our strategic goals – continuous growth and sustainable value enhancement for our shareholders.”  ### Overview of the HeidelbergCement Group January to September 2017  Key financial figures (reported) | January-September | Q3   ---|---|---   €m | 2016 | 2017 | Variance | 2016 | 2017 | Variance   Sales volumes   Cement (Mt) | 73,047 | 94,408 | 29% | 33,153 | 33,749 | 2%   Aggregates (Mt) | 198,687 | 228,990 | 15% | 80,309 | 86,687 | 8%   Ready-mixed concrete (Mm3) | 30,405 | 35,040 | 15% | 12,483 | 12,419 | -1%   Asphalt (Mt) | 7,071 | 7,099 | 0% | 3,115 | 3,195 | 3%   Income statement   Revenue | 10,927 | 13,004 | 19% | 4,520 | 4,610 | 2%   Result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation | 2,121 | 2,405 | 13% | 1,009 | 1,058 | 5%   in % of revenue | 19.4% | 18.5% |  | 22.3% | 23.0% |    Result from current operations1) | 1,477 | 1,578 | 7% | 738 | 787 | 7%   Profit before tax from continuing operations | 737 | 880 | 19% | 384 | 518 | 35%   Group share of profit | 585 | 768 | 31% | 339 | 481 | 42%   Earnings per share in € (IAS 33) 2) | 3.06 | 3.87 | 26% | 1.75 | 2.42 | 38%   Statement of cash flows and balance sheet   Cash flow from operating activities | 762 | 705 | -58 | 548 | 836 | 288   Investments (cash outflow) | -1,699 | -785 | 914 | -1,256 | -265 | 990   Net debt | 8,868 | 9,653 | 785 |  |  |    Gearing | 53.6% | 59.4% |  |  |  |       1) Result from current operations includes negative impact of € -14 million in Q3 2017 (1-9\/2017: € -44 million) from Italcementi purchase price allocation   2) Attributable to the shareholders of HeidelbergfCement AG  Pro forma key financial figures1)  |   January-September  | Q3   ---|---|---   €m | 2016 | 2017 | Vari-ance | Like-for- like2) | 2016 | 2017 | Vari-ance | Like-for- like2   Sales volumes   Cement (Mt) | 94,214 | 94,408 | 0% | 0% | 33,153 | 33,749 | 2% | 2%   Aggregates (Mt) | 214,068 | 228,990 | 7% | 1% | 80,309 | 86,687 | 8% | 0%   Ready-mixed concrete (Mm3) | 35,985 | 35,040 | -3% | -3% | 12,483 | 12,419 | -1% | -2%   Asphalt (Mt) | 7,071 | 7,099 | 0% | -2% | 3,115 | 3,195 | 3% | -2%   Income statement   Revenue | 12,846 | 13,004 | 1% | 1% | 4,520 | 4,610 | 2% | 4%   Result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation | 2,377 | 2,405 | 1% | 2% | 1,009 | 1,058 | 5% | 7%   in % of revenue | 18.5% | 18.5% |  |  | 22.3% | 23.0% |  |    Result from current operations3) | 1,566 | 1,578 | 1% | 2% | 738 | 787 | 7% | 8%      1) Including Italcementi in the first half year 2016   2) Adjusted for currency and consolidation effects and excluding CO2 gains of €17 million in Q2 2016   3) Result from current operations includes negative impact of € -14 million in Q3 2017 (1-9\/2017: € -44 million) from Italcementi purchase price allocation  15,500 characters  Financial calendar","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2017-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"HeidelbergCement reports results for the third quarter of 2017 ","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Finance","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/pr-08-11-2017","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":7281,"text":"### On Thursday, 9 May 2019, at the Palatin Kongresshotel Wiesloch, Germany  In his speech to about 520 shareholders, Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board, offered a look back at HeidelbergCement’s successful development in 2018. The company reached most of its goals despite a challenging environment with adverse weather in core markets and significantly increased energy costs. A decline in result from current operations could be more than compensated by higher gains from the portfolio optimisation, lower restructuring costs and an improved financial result. In summary, sales volumes, revenues and net income reached new record figures. The portfolio optimisation made good progress and delivered about €600 million of disposal proceeds. Net debt was reduced by more than €300 million. In addition, as in the previous year, the company has earned a premium on its cost of capital. The strategic priorities - shareholder returns and continuous growth - are clearly reflected in the ninth consecutive increase in dividend.  #### Good start into the year - outlook confirmed for 2019  Dr. Bernd Scheifele also reported on the results and developments in the first quarter of 2019, and confirmed the outlook for the remainder of the year given at the publication of the 2018 annual results in March 2019. “HeidelbergCement had a great start into the new year,\" explained Dr. Bernd Scheifele. \"We significantly increased revenue and result from current operations and are on track to meet our 2019 targets.\"  #### Dividend increased by 11%  The Annual General Meeting has approved the proposal of the administration to increase the dividend by 11% to €2.10 with a substantial majority of 99.89%. “With the ninth consecutive dividend increase we consistently implement our progressive dividend strategy and share our successful business development with our shareholders,” explained Dr. Bernd Scheifele. “The dividend payment for 2018 is a new record in the history of HeidelbergCement.”  #### Shareholder representatives of the Supervisory Board elected  Furthermore, the Annual General Meeting has elected the shareholder representatives of the Supervisory Board. The shareholders have approved the proposals of the administration with a substantial majority.

{"id":7283,"text":"Following a thorough validation procedure, HeidelbergCement’s CO2 reduction targets 2030 have been successfully assessed against the Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi) criteria. This makes HeidelbergCement the first company in the cement sector, and one of currently only about 200 companies worldwide, to have approved science-based targets.  The SBTi independently assesses and validates corporate emissions reduction targets against the latest climate science: Targets adopted by companies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are considered “science-based” if they are in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement – to limit global warming to well-below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.  HeidelbergCement’s CO2 reduction strategy is based on concrete bottom-up measures on plant and product level. These include improving energy efficiency, and a steadily increasing use of alternative fuels and alternative raw materials. \"Concrete has the potential to become the most sustainable building material,\" says Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. \"Our goal is to realise the vision of CO2-neutral concrete by 2050 at the latest. In the coming years, we want to make significant progress in this direction, and the SBTi’s approval is a clear proof of our strong commitment.\"  HeidelbergCement’s SBTi-approved target is to reduce scope 1 GHG emissions 15% per ton of cementitious materials by 2030 from a 2016 base year. HeidelbergCement also commits to reduce scope 2 GHG emissions 65% per ton of cementitious materials within the same timeframe1). The SBTi-approved target is consistent with HeidelbergCement’s previously formulated goal of a 30% reduction in its specific net CO2 emissions by 2030, compared with 1990. To date, HeidelbergCement has already managed to achieve a reduction of 20% and is in a leading position when it comes to the development of new technologies for CO2 sequestration and use, e.g. by returning the CO2 into the material cycle of cement and concrete through recarbonation.   1) The target boundary includes biogenic emissions and removals associated with the use of bioenergy.  2,100 characters","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2019-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"HeidelbergCement first cement company to receive approval for science-based CO2 reduction targets","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Sustainability","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/pr-13-05-2019","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":7294,"text":"HeidelbergCement’s North American subsidiary Lehigh Cement and the International CCS Knowledge Centre today announced a feasibility study of a full-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project as a definitive solution to cut greenhouse gas emissions in Canada.  The study targets the feasibility to capture the majority of the CO2 from the flue gas of the Edmonton, Alberta, cement plant, thereby significantly reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from cement production. The study will encompass engineering designs, cost estimation, and a fulsome business case analysis. Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) is supporting the initiative with CAD1.4 million (around €960,000).  “This is a North American first in the cement industry to examine the feasibility of full-scale CCS as a definitive solution to cut greenhouse gas emissions,” says Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “A 90-95% CO2 capture rate is targeted at our Edmonton cement plant. The project is another important milestone on our path to become carbon neutral in concrete by latest 2050.”  Earlier this year, on 5 September 2019, HeidelbergCement and the state-owned Norwegian energy group Equinor signed a memorandum of understanding on CCS of CO2 of the company’s Norcem cement plant in Brevik, Norway.  HeidelbergCement is set to reduce its specific net CO2 emissions per tonne of cement by 30% compared to 1990 levels by 2030.

{"id":7299,"text":"* ###### Revenue up by 4% to €18.9 billion    * ###### Results from current operations before depreciation increase by around 16% to €3.6 billion    * ###### All Group areas contribute to growth of results    * ###### Net debt significantly reduced by €1.2 billion to €7.1 billion     In addition to the preliminary unaudited figures already published on 12 February 2020, HeidelbergCement presents today – as scheduled – preliminary unaudited figures for the Group areas and the fourth quarter 2019.  “We have concluded the 2019 business year successfully,” said Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “All Group areas contributed to the good results – however with varied development in the respective Group regions and quarters. This shows once more, that we profit overall from our broad regional presence and the vertical integration from cement to aggregates to ready-mixed concrete and asphalt.”  #### Good revenue and results growth  Group revenue for the whole of 2019 increased by 4.3% to €18.9 billion (previous year: 18.1) compared to the previous year. Excluding consolidation and exchange rate effects, it grew by 2.1%. Positive revenues in the core activities cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete were offset by lower revenue in our trading business – caused especially by the trading of fuels that has been reduced in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Results from current operations before depreciation increased by 15.5% to €3,580 million (previous year: 3,100). Like-for-like, the rise amounted to 2.5%. The result from current operations increased by 8.8% to €2,186 million (previous year: 2,010). Like-for-like, it rose by 4.7%.  All Group areas contributed to the growth of results from current operations before depreciation. Western and Southern Europe recorded the highest rise, followed by Asia-Pacific and Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia. Results in North America and in the Group area Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin also developed positively.  In the fourth quarter 2019, results of the Group areas were characterised by various dynamics. In North America, business in the US developed positively, while results in Western Canada declined. Results in Western- and Southern Europe were impaired by the strong comparable basis of the previous year’s quarter as well as market-related temporary effects in the UK, Belgium\/Netherlands, and France. In the Group area Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia, especially the eastern European countries contributed to the results growth. In Asia-Pacific, good results in Indonesia and Thailand more than offset the weaker development in Australia. Recovery in the Group area Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin continued in the fourth quarter.  #### Net debt reduced stronger than expected  Net debt could be significantly reduced further in the fourth quarter 2019. Before accounting of lease liabilities amounting to around €1.3 billion, net debt declined by approximately €1.2 billion to €7.1 billion compared to the previous year. Dynamic gearing ratio fell to 2.3x. “As already in the third quarter, we were able to generate a strong cash flow also in the last quarter and thereby net debt fell markedly below the already downward adjusted forecast from November 2019,” said Dr. Lorenz Näger, Chief Financial Officer of HeidelbergCement.  #### Initial outlook 2020  In its forecast from January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) anticipates a continuation of global economic growth. The growth rate is expected to increase from 2.9% in 2019 to 3.3% in 2020. This positive assumption is based on signs of growing industrial production, increasing worldwide trade and looser monetary policy, favourable developments in the trade talks between the USA and China, and the prospect of an orderly Brexit.  The development of economic output is also reflected in the estimated demand for building materials. HeidelbergCement expects demand to further develop positively in many markets in the 2020 business year, in particular in the emerging markets. Crucial factors for the actual extent of growth include local economic development, the amount of public investment, and the development of credit costs for property financing.  The complete consolidated financial statements ot HeidelbergCement including the outlook for the business year 2020 will be published on 19 March 2020.  #### Preliminary Group figures  Key financial

{"id":7300,"text":"HeidelbergCement’s British subsidiary Hanson UK is taking part in a research project on the use of climate-neutral fuels for cement production. The project investigates the potential to reduce carbon emissions by switching from fossil fuels to hydrogen and plasma technology. The research project has been coordinated by UK industry body the Mineral Products Association (MPA) and is funded by a £3.2 million award from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).  Cement production using hydrogen and biomass fuels on an industrial scale will be demonstrated at Hanson UK's Ribblesdale cement plant. The research results will then be shared across the industry to maximise the environmental benefit of the technology. Simon Willis, CEO of Hanson UK, said: \"Cutting CO2 emissions is a key priority for us and we are delighted to be playing a leading role in this project\".  \"We have been very effective across the Group in reducing our CO2 emissions, partly through the steadily increasing use of alternative fuels,\" said Dr Dominik von Achten, CEO of HeidelbergCement. \"In addition to our activities in the field of carbon capture, use and storage, this project in the United Kingdom is an important step towards realising our vision of producing CO2-neutral concrete by 2050\".

{"id":7305,"text":"* ###### Short-time work agreed for employees in Germany    * ###### Waiver of salary for supervisory board, executive board and management    * ###### Virtual Annual General Meeting scheduled for 4 June 2020     In response to the profound effects of the Corona virus, HeidelbergCement has agreed with the works council and employee representatives to introduce short-time work for its employees in Germany. Initially, the short-time working regulations primarily affect employees from the Group's head office in Heidelberg. The extent of short-time work is determined for employees depending on the loss of work and can be up to 100 percent.  In addition, the Supervisory Board and the Management Board of HeidelbergCement have decided to voluntarily waive 20 percent of their fixed salaries in the second quarter of 2020. Dr. Dominik von Achten, CEO of HeidelbergCement AG, said: “In addition to the necessary cost savings, this is a clear sign of solidarity in the company, especially with our foreign subsidiaries. We all have to do our part to cope with the difficult situation around Covid-19 as best as possible. The aim is to extend this voluntary sign of solidarity to the next management level in the company.\"  In the corporate headquarters as well as in many national affiliates of HeidelbergCement, the management has called on managers to take a similar, voluntary solidarity action and has received broad commitment. In countries where comparable instruments for short-time work are available, the company also uses them.  In mid-March, the board had already agreed with the works council on company holidays for the head office in Heidelberg until the end of April 2020. Many foreign subsidiaries had already started reducing working hours and adjusting the number of employees as needed at the beginning of March.  #### Annual General Meeting scheduled for 4 June 2020  HeidelbergCement plans to hold the company's Annual General Meeting on 4 June 2020 as a purely virtual event without the physical presence of shareholders and shareholder representatives. The HeidelbergCement Annual General Meeting was originally scheduled for May 7, 2020. Thanks to the virtual format made possible by the legislator this year, the company's general meeting can now take place with only a slight delay.  The entire Annual General Meeting is to be broadcast online for the shareholders. Shareholders should be able to exercise their voting rights by postal vote or by proxy to the company's proxies, with instructions to be possible online shortly before voting begins. Registered shareholders can submit questions on the agenda at least two days before the Annual General Meeting. The exact rules will be found in the invitation to the Annual General Meeting.

{"id":7310,"text":"* Focus on climate protection and reduction of CO2 emissions    * CO2 reduction targets recognised as science-based by the Science Based Targets initiative   * Top grade in the CDP sustainability rating in the area of climate protection     Today, HeidelbergCement published its Sustainability Report for the 2019 financial year. On around 100 pages, the company’s 11th Sustainability Report informs about a range of topics including the current status of emission reduction and the research on technologies that enable CO2 savings on a large scale.   „Sustainable business in harmony with the environment and the careful use of natural resources are an integral part of HeidelbergCement’s strategy,” says Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “We have declared our express commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, we will continue to intensify our commitment to climate protection in the coming years.”  HeidelbergCement has set itself the goal of reducing its specific CO2 emissions per tonne of cement by 30% compared with 1990. This goal has been recognised by the Science Based Targets initiative. By 2019, HeidelbergCement has already achieved a reduction of 22%. HeidelbergCement wants to realise its vision of a CO2-neutral concrete by 2050 at the latest. For its performance in the area of climate protection, HeidelbergCement was ranked on the “Climate Change A List”, achieving the top grade A in the CDP sustainability rating (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) in the reporting year.  Besides the topic of climate protection, the report documents the company’s activities regarding human rights and compliance as well as occupational health and safety. In 2019, targeted measures have been implemented in all Group countries to optimise technical and organisational safety standards. Numerous training sessions increased the employees’ awareness for occupational safety.  Other key topics of the report are social responsibility and the intense exchange with different stakeholders in areas such as supply chain and supplier management, research and development, biodiversity as well as sustainable land use and water management: „We can only shape the future of our company through dialogue – with our employees, our neighbours, our customers, suppliers and shareholders,” says Dr. Dominik von Achten.   The report complies with the established standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and has been validated in accordance with the GRI Standards: “Core” option. It also underlines the Group’s commitment to the principles of the UN Global Compact (UN GC) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SGDs).

{"id":7311,"text":"* ###### COVID-19 related revaluation of the asset portfolio of the HeidelbergCement Group leads to depreciation of goodwill and other assets of approximately   EUR 3.4 billion    * ###### Measures from COPE will already take effect in the short term and will partially compensate the impact caused by the decline in sales volumes in Q2 2020    * ###### Long-term business outlook remains good     Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, HeidelbergCement AG comprehensively reviewed the business prospects of all significant local business units of the Group in the second quarter of 2020, considering the expected effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on the business of HeidelbergCement. On this basis, HeidelbergCement carried out an impairment test of the asset portfolio.  The audit leads to an impairment of goodwill and tangible fixed assets shown in the consolidated balance sheet totaling around EUR 3.4 billion before tax. The impairment burdens the result but does not lead to liquidity outflows.  Reasons for the impairments are in particular:    1. Due to the influence of the Corona pandemic, the original business expectations have shifted into the future and have decreased within the specified planning period.   2. Economic special effects in individual countries in which HeidelbergCement operates (particularly in the United Kingdom due to the country's withdrawal from the European Union)   3. Increase of the market risk premium used for valuation purposes from 6% to 7% based on the increased recommendation for the cost of capital by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IdW).    Regionally, the impairments relate mainly to business units in Western and Southern Europe (United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Spain) with approximately EUR 2.7 billion, North America with approximately EUR 0.3 billion, Asia\/Pacific (Malaysia, Australia, and Indonesia) with approximately EUR 0.2 billion as well as Northern and Eastern Europe and Central Asia (Kazakhstan and Bulgaria) with approximately EUR 0.1 billion.  Approximately two thirds of the impairments relate to the portfolio of assets acquired as part of the Hanson acquisition, around one fifth relate to the Italcementi acquisition. Overall, around half of the impairments are attributable to assets in the UK.  The impairment is independent of the short-term operational development of the company. With the COPE action plan, the company launched a comprehensive bundle of measures in February that focuses on maintaining liquidity and cost savings. HeidelbergCement assumes that these measures will already take effect in the short term and partially compensate the impact caused by the decline in sales volumes in the second quarter of 2020.  In the long term, the company continues to expect good business prospects.

{"id":7317,"text":"### Quarterly Statement January to September 2020    * ###### Strong operational performance in third quarter – operating EBITDA*) increases by 17% like-for-like with nearly flat revenue, leading to significant margin improvement    * ###### COPE action plan fully on track – cash savings of €721 million in the first nine months    * ###### Excellent financial performance – free cash flow over the last twelve months increases by almost 50% to €2.3 billion, net debt reduced by €1.8 billion compared to September 2019    * ###### Outlook for full year 2020 – operating EBITDA*) expected to be above previous year; year-end leverage ratio expected at ≤ 2.0x      *) Result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation  Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement:   “HeidelbergCement has achieved an excellent result in the third quarter of 2020. In an environment that continues to be characterised by major regional differences and great uncertainty, we were able to increase EBITDA by 17% in comparison with the previous year.   The broad regional setup and strong cohesion within our company are paying off. All Group areas contributed to the improvement in results. The measures launched in February as part of our COPE action plan are taking effect. Since the programme was launched, we have achieved Group-wide cash savings of over €700 million, exactly in line with our plan. All measures have been and continue to be focused on health protection for our employees, customers and service providers.   I would like to express my special thanks to all our employees around the world, who have made this good result possible with extraordinary commitment and under sometimes difficult conditions.  The strong figures speak for themselves. As a result of the very strong development of results in the third quarter of 2020, we anticipate that operating EBITDA for the full year 2020 will be above the previous year. HeidelbergCement is very well positioned, even for difficult times. When the economy picks up again and construction activity in our markets returns to normal, we will have very good prospects for sustainable and profitable growth. We will seize the growth opportunities that present themselves.”  #### Development of sales volumes January to September 2020  The effects of the coronavirus pandemic hampered construction activities and the associated demand for our building materials worldwide in the first nine months.  Group-wide cement and clinker sales volumes fell by 4.7% to 90.1 million tonnes (previous year: 94.5) in the first nine months. Excluding consolidation effects, the decline amounted to 4.0%. On a like-for-like basis, deliveries in the Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin Group area recorded a solid increase. In Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia, sales volumes remained at the previous year’s level. Volumes declined in the other Group areas.   Deliveries of aggregates were 5.3% below the previous year’s level at 220.8 million tonnes (previous year: 233.3). A slight increase in sales volumes in Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia stood in contrast to significant decreases in volumes in Western and Southern Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin, while North America remained only slightly below the previous year. Excluding consolidation effects, sales volumes declined by 4.6%.  Sales volumes of ready-mixed concrete fell by 9.2% to 34.4 million cubic metres (previous year: 38.0). With the exception of North America, where deliveries were slightly above the previous year, volumes declined in all Group areas. Excluding consolidation effects, deliveries of ready-mixed concrete declined by 9.5%. Asphalt deliveries decreased by 3.6% to 8.1 million tonnes (previous year: 8.4). Adjusted for consolidation effects, deliveries fell by 5.0%.  #### Development of revenue and results  Group revenue from January to September 2020 decreased by 7.9% in comparison with the previous year to €13,140 million (previous year: 14,273). Excluding consolidation and exchange rate effects, the decline amounted to 6.9%. Changes to the scope of consolidation of €4 million and exchange rate effects of €159 million had a negative impact on revenue.  The result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation (RCOBD) grew by €119 million or 4.6% to €2,731 million (previous year: 2,612). Excluding consolidation and exchange rate effects, the operational increase amounted to €156 million, 6.1% above the previous year. The strong operational performance in the third quarter, with RCOBD up 13.1% and 16.5% on a like-for-like basis, was a major contributory factor. The RCOBD margin improved by almost 400 basis points to 27.2% (previous year: 23.2%). Besides successful price increases and reduced energy costs, significant savings resulting from the COPE action plan launched in February 2020 had a particularly positive impact on the result. The North America action plan is also beginning to take effect. The result from current operations rose by 8.4% to €1,715 million (previous year: 1,583). Changes to the scope of consolidation contributed €3 million to the improvement in the result from current operations, while exchange rate effects reduced the result by €31 million.  #### Financial position  In the first nine months of 2020, despite the difficult market environment, the cash inflow from operating activities of continuing operations rose by €447 million to €1,489 million (previous year: 992). The cost savings, lower investments, and active management of current asset items as part of the COPE action plan had a noticeable impact.  As a result of the solid operational development, the free cash flow for the last 12 months increased substantially to around €2.3 billion (previous year: 1.6). As at 30 September 2020, net debt amounted to €7.9 billion (previous year: 9.7). In comparison with 30 September 2019, net debt was reduced significantly by €1.8 billion. This highlights the enormous financial strength of the company, which is particularly valuable during the current coronavirus crisis.  Thanks to the strong cash flow development and strict expenditure discipline, net debt decreased by €0.5 billion compared with the end of 2019 (€8.4 billion). At the end of September 2020, the leverage ratio, i.e. the ratio of net debt to result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation over the last 12 months, stood at 2.1x. The long-term target corridor is 1.5x to 2.0x. \"We expect a strong cash flow again in the fourth quarter,\" said Dr. Lorenz Näger, Chief Financial Officer of HeidelbergCement. \"We therefore assume that we will already reach the upper limit of our target corridor for the leverage ratio by the end of 2020.\"   On 12 October 2020, the rating agency S&P Global Ratings confirmed the existing rating of HeidelbergCement (BBB-) and raised the outlook from stable to positive.  #### Sustainability as a high priority  HeidelbergCement is placing a high priority on addressing the issue of sustainability. In September 2020, the company achieved an AA rating in the MSCI ESG Ratings for the fifth time in a row. The AA rating places HeidelbergCement in the “Leader” category in ESG (Environment Social Governance). The Group received above-average scores in all rating criteria.   The company has also made further progress in developing sustainable and low-carbon products. With i.tech® 3D, HeidelbergCement is delivering an innovative concrete for the first printed residential building in Germany. The high-tech material was developed by HeidelbergCement subsidiary Italcementi specifically for 3D printing and is suitable for versatile use with various types of 3D printers.   By 2025, the company aims to reduce specific net CO2 emissions to below 525 kg per tonne of cementitious material. This figure represents a 30% reduction compared with 1990 and was previously only targeted for 2030. HeidelbergCement aspires to be forerunner in the building materials industry in the gradual reduction of its CO2 emissions and aims to offer CO2-neutral concrete by 2050 at the latest.  #### Outlook for 2020  HeidelbergCement’s operations have proven extremely resilient so far this year. At an early stage, the company took all the necessary measures to cushion the impact of the coronavirus-related decline in construction activity on its revenue and result as far as possible.   Thanks to the very strong development of results in the third quarter of 2020, HeidelbergCement now anticipates that the result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation for the whole of 2020 will exceed that of the previous year. The company expects to further reduce its leverage ratio to 2.0x or lower.   For the future, HeidelbergCement anticipates continued good prospects for sustainable and profitable growth in the medium to long term. The Group believes that construction activity in individual core markets may benefit in the medium term from infrastructural and other economic stimulus programmes announced by governments.   #### Risks and opportunities  Risks and opportunities that may have a significant impact on our financial position and performance in the 2020 financial year and in the foreseeable future are described in detail in the Annual Report 2019 in the Outlook chapter on page 58 ff. and in the Risk and opportunity report chapter on page 63 ff.   At the time of compiling the Annual Report on 18 March 2020, it was not possible to predict the extent to which global economic development would be affected by the spread of the coronavirus. After the unprecedented slump in spring, the global economy has recovered somewhat, but the renewed escalation of the pandemic in autumn with further lockdowns in many countries has somewhat dampened hopes of a rapid upturn. Nevertheless, in a holistic view of individual risks and the overall risk situation, the company, from today’s perspective, does not expect identifiable risks that could threaten the existence of the Group.

{"id":7319,"text":"Today, HeidelbergCement’s subsidiary Ciments Calcia presented the draft terms of its large-scale investment and reorganisation programme for several of its sites in France. The programme is in line with HeidelbergCement’s strategy to create a sustainable low-carbon and high performance business throughout the Group.  “As part of our global business excellence initiative, we intend to further optimise effectiveness, processes and structures of our French sites,” says Dr Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “We want to considerably speed up the modernisation of our plants in order to enhance our performance in France, while ensuring alignment with the goals of the Paris agreement. This is why we focus our initiatives on the main CO2-emitting plants in France.”   The programme comprises investments of around €400 million at the Ciments Calcia plants, of which nearly €300 million are earmarked for the Airvault site alone. The company intends to adapt the organisation at its French headquarters and at two of its production sites in France in the following way:    * Conversion of the plant in Gargenville (Yvelines) into a modern grinding center and shut down of the kiln system and quarry operations. This adjustment would in particular enhance the sustainability of this strategically important site, which supplies the Parisian basin via inland waterways.   * Shut down of white cement production at the Cruas (Ardèche) site. The site would be converted into an automated cement terminal for the distribution of white cement.   * Review of the organisation of headquarters in Guerville (Yvelines) and adaptation to the company’s transformation.    The reorganisation would result in the reduction of 162 jobs and creation of 20 new jobs.   HeidelbergCement is significantly pushing its ambitious climate goals. By 2025, the company aims to reduce specific net CO2 emissions to below 525 kg per tonne of cementitious material. This figure corresponds to a reduction of 30% compared to 1990. To achieve this goal, the company has defined concrete measures for all plants worldwide.

{"id":7326,"text":"After very good results from the first project phase, HeidelbergCement is starting the further development and scaling-up of the LEILAC technology (Low Emissions Intensity Lime And Cement) together with the Australian technology company Calix and a European consortium. After examining different locations, it has been decided to build the LEILAC 2 demonstration installation for carbon capture at the HeidelbergCement cement plant in Hanover, Germany.  As part of LEILAC 1, a CO2 capture pilot installation with a capture capacity of 25,000 tonnes of CO2 per year was constructed at HeidelbergCement's Lixhe plant in Belgium in 2017. With LEILAC 2, an installation around four times as large will be operated in Hanover, which will capture 20% of the cement plant’s capacity, corresponding to around 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The first project design phase is to be completed by the end of June 2021, and the demonstration installation is expected to be ready by the end of 2023. Including design, construction, commissioning and extensive testing, the overall project is expected to be completed by 2025.  \"The LEILAC technology has the potential to enable the cement and lime industries to efficiently capture their process emissions on an industrial scale,\" says HeidelbergCement's Chairman of the Managing Board Dr. Dominik von Achten. \"The pilot project in Hanover is one of several promising CO2 capture technologies that we are currently testing at full speed within the HeidelbergCement Group.\"  With the patented LEILAC technology, the CO2 released during cement production can be captured in a highly pure form via a separate waste gas stream and used in another process. Like its predecessor project LEILAC 1, LEILAC 2 is based on Calix's innovative calciner technology. The project costs amount to €25 million, of with €16 million are coming from the EU research funding programme Horizon 2020 and €9 million are being provided by the partners of the project consortium. HeidelbergCement's share of this amounts to €3 million. The project in Hannover will also include preliminary investigations into the use of the captured CO2.  \"In cement production, two thirds of the CO2 emissions consist of process-related emissions that are released when heating the limestone and are therefore unavoidable. The LEILAC 1 project has already successfully demonstrated that this unavoidable process CO2 can be successfully captured and that the technology also works in practice on a larger scale,\" says Jan Theulen, Director Alternative Ressources at HeidelbergCement. Main aspects of the LEILAC 2 project are now the further scaling-up of the technology to large industrial scale, the complete integration of the process into an existing cement plant and the heat supply for the installation from renewable energies for climate-neutral CO2 capture.   HeidelbergCement has set itself the goal of reducing its CO2 emissions by 30% by 2025 compared with the reference year 1990. In order to achieve this, the Group has intensified its research in the area of CO2 emissions and is investing in several different pilot projects and technologies for the capture, utilisation and storage (CCU\/S) of CO2 emissions. HeidelbergCement is a global leader in the building materials industry in the development and application of innovative technologies for CO2 capture and utilisation. In addition to LEILAC, the company is involved in a number of other development and scaling projects – for example, in Norway in the CCS project \"Northern Lights\" or in Germany with partners from the cement industry in the CCU project \"Catch4Climate\".

{"id":7328,"text":"HeidelbergCement’s British subsidiary Hanson UK has become a partner in the HyNet North West consortium, which aims to create the world’s first low-carbon industrial cluster in the region of North West England. The proposed hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) project will play a critical role in the UK’s transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and the fight against climate change.   “Our involvement in HyNet North West is the next step in HeidelbergCement’s path towards industrial scaling of carbon capture technologies”, says Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “Carbon capture and utilization or storage is a key part of our climate strategy, and we are already seeing great success with our various initiatives.” HeidelbergCement only recently reported progress on three other CCU\/S projects in Norway and Germany.   HyNet North West covers the largest concentration of advanced manufacturing and chemical production in the UK, including Hanson’s Padeswood cement plant. As a first step, a feasibility study will be conducted to provide a clear design basis and cost estimate for a capture facility at the Padeswood plant, and connection to the proposed HyNet North West CO2 network and storage system. The project will reduce regional CO2 emissions by up to 10 million tonnes every year by 2030 – including up to 800,000 tonnes from the Hanson plant in Padeswood. This is the equivalent of taking four million cars off the road.  HyNet North West will deliver 80 per cent of the national hydrogen production target, 100 per cent of the national target for CCS capacity by 2030, and a hydrogen town. The HyNet North West project also includes production, storage and distribution of low carbon hydrogen, which will help to decarbonise other industries whose CO2 emissions primarily come from fossil fuels. The project, led by Progressive Energy, is being developed by a consortium of regionally located partners including Cadent, CF Fertilisers, Eni UK, Essar, INOVYN and the University of Chester as well as Hanson.

{"id":7329,"text":"HeidelbergCement’s US subsidiary Lehigh Hanson and Silicon Valley-based materials technology company Fortera have announced a collaboration to implement a new type of carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technology in a pilot installation at Lehigh’s Redding California cement facility, with an expected 60% reduction in CO2 emissions per tonne of product. Both partners will construct and operate a small commercial plant where CO2 will be captured from the kiln exhaust and converted into a cementitious material. The final product will be suitable for use as a new low carbon SCM (Supplementary Cementitious Material) in the production of high-quality concrete with a lower CO2 footprint.  “We are delighted to add yet another technology to our existing portfolio of carbon capture initiatives, contributing to the circular economy”, says Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “Carbon capture and utilisation or storage (CCU\/S) is one key lever to significantly reduce otherwise unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions in the cement industry. This is why building new partnerships towards CCU\/S and investing in breakthrough technologies are a core part of HeidelbergCement’s climate strategy.”  The product generated within the new carbon capture process at the Redding plant will be the first cementitious material produced commercially from CO2 captured directly from a cement kiln. Fortera’s proprietary recarbonation (ReCarbTM) process works by tapping into the existing feedstock and equipment at the plant, while production carries on as usual from the quarry to the kiln. Instead of then releasing CO2, the kiln exhaust is captured and mineralized into a cementitious material. The material can be co-blended with portland cement and used by ready mixed concrete producers as a Supplementary Cementitious Material (SCM) or as a cementitious binder for preformed concrete materials like bricks, blocks or precast structures.

The authorisation processes and the construction period are estimated to take just under ten years. A feasibility study, which has already been launched, will address critical issues related to technology selection, environmental impact, legal issues, financing, logistics, and energy supply. The captured CO2 will be safely transported to a permanent storage site offshore several kilometres down in bedrock.  HeidelbergCement is currently building the world’s first full-scale installation for carbon capture at the Brevik cement plant in Norway, capturing 400,000 tonnes annually or 50% of the plant’s emissions from 2024 onwards. “Based on the positive collaboration with the Norwegian government and other partners at our site in Brevik, we have now chosen to significantly ramp up our ambitions for a carbon capture installation in Sweden that is four times larger,” said Giv Brantenberg, General Manager of HeidelbergCement Northern Europe. The planning for the plant in Slite will benefit significantly from the experience gained at Brevik.

Led by the British Mineral Products Association (MPA), and funded by the British Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), Hanson UK successfully implemented a mix of 100 per cent climate-neutral fuels including hydrogen for commercial scale cement manufacture for the very first time.  During the demonstration at Ribblesdale, the proportion of fuels in the cement kiln’s main burner was gradually increased to a wholly net zero mix made up of tanker-delivered hydrogen as well as biomass components and glycerine, generated as by-products of other industries[1]. If fully implemented for the whole kiln system, nearly 180,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide could be avoided each year at Ribblesdale alone compared to using fossil fuels, such as coal.  The trial at Ribblesdale follows a BEIS-funded feasibility study in 2019 which demonstrated that a combination of biomass, hydrogen and plasma energy could be used to eliminate 100 per cent of fossil fuel CO2 emissions from cement manufacturing – provided the necessary framework conditions and infrastructure.  The trial which is part of a wider £3.2 million project has been funded by BEIS as part of its Industrial Fuel Switching Competition. Project results will be shared with cement producers and other energy-intensive industries both in the UK and globally as best practice examples, with the aim of spreading and maximising the environmental benefits of the technology.  [1] The fuel switching trial has used ‘grey’ hydrogen as a proof of concept, which can be substituted for ‘green’ hydrogen in future. At a 100% climate-neutral mix, the proportion of fuels in the cement kiln was approximately 39% hydrogen, 12% meat and bone meal (MBM) and 49% glycerine.

{"id":7350,"text":"* ###### HeidelbergCement’s British subsidiary Hanson UK and its partners in the HyNet North West consortium will receive government funding for their planned low-carbon industrial cluster.    * ###### This also gives Hanson the confidence to invest in a carbon capture plant at its Padeswood cement works, which will connect to the planned HyNet CO2 transport and storage system.    * ###### HyNet will reduce regional CO2 emissions by up to 10 million tonnes – including up to 800,000 tonnes from Hanson’s Padeswood plant – every year by 2030; the equivalent of taking four million cars off the road.     HeidelbergCement’s British subsidiary Hanson UK and its partners in the HyNet North West consortium, which aims to create the world’s first low-carbon industrial cluster in the region of North West England and North Wales, were chosen for funding under the British government’s carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) cluster sequencing process. HyNet’s proposed hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) project will play a critical role in the UK’s transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and the fight against climate change.   The announcement will result in huge economic benefits to the region, safeguarding existing jobs and creating around 6,000 new employment opportunities. It also gives Hanson the confidence to invest in a carbon capture plant at its Padeswood cement works, which will connect to the planned HyNet CO2 transport and storage system. The company is already carrying out a CCS feasibility study at the site, which will provide a clear design basis and cost estimate for the next stage.  “Yesterday’s announcement is great news for HeidelbergCement, and a well-deserved recognition for the HyNet consortium and our colleagues working on CCS in the UK as part of this collaborative project.

{"id":7352,"text":"### Quarterly Statement January to September 2021    * ###### Revenue and results increase significantly on a like-for-like basis1) in the first nine months of 2021 – Group revenue +9%; result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation +8%; result from current operations +16%    * ###### Results of the third quarter impacted by exceptionally high year-on-year basis and significant energy cost inflation    * ###### New business excellence programme with >€500 million cost mitigation target launched    * ###### Portfolio optimisation continued – disposal of several assets in Spain and acquisition of Tanga Cement in Tanzania    * ###### Up to 10 million tonnes of CO2 reduction with current CCU\/S projects planned until 2030     * ###### Forecast for results confirmed, forecast for ROIC and leverage ratio raised     1) Adjusted for consolidation and currency effects  Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement, said: “HeidelbergCement has achieved a good result in the first nine months of 2021. The general conditions in the third quarter were very challenging due to the exceptionally high year-on-year basis in the previous year and the significant increases in energy costs in recent months. We remain optimistic for the final quarter and confirm our growth forecast for the full year 2021.  We look forward to 2022 with confidence. The global infrastructure measures will gradually contribute to growth from next year onwards. The momentum in private residential construction also remains high. In order to tap further potential within the Group and, in particular, to compensate for the significant increases in energy costs, we have launched a new business excellence programme with the aim of mitigating the cost inflation by at least €500 million by the end of 2022.  We are making good progress in the implementation of our “Beyond 2020” strategy. HeidelbergCement's capital efficiency and leverage ratio have continued to improve significantly. The disposal of assets in Spain and the acquisition of Tanga Cement in Tanzania contribute to the optimisation of our portfolio. Regarding the transformation topics of sustainability and digitalisation, we underline our leading role in our industry sector. The projects for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCU\/S) are off to a great start. Only with our CCU\/S projects already underway, we aim to save up to 10 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030. The digitalisation of our customer interfaces is gaining momentum. We are well on track to achieve our medium and long-term targets earlier than expected.”  #### Positive development of sales volumes in the first nine months  In the first nine months of the year, total deliveries rose in all business lines in comparison with the previous year.   Group-wide cement and clinker sales volumes grew by 6.2% to 95.7 million tonnes (previous year: 90.1). Excluding consolidation effects, the increase amounted to 6.6%. All Group areas contributed to the growth in sales volumes, with Western and Southern Europe and Asia-Pacific in particular achieving significant increases in volumes. Deliveries of aggregates rose by 4.7% in comparison with the previous year to 231.3 million tonnes (previous year: 220.8). All Group areas recorded increases in sales volumes. The Western and Southern Europe area made by far the largest contribution in this business line too. Sales volumes of ready-mixed concrete increased by 3.6% to 35.7 million cubic metres (previous year: 34.4). Excluding consolidation effects, the rise amounted to 4.3%. With the exception of Asia-Pacific, deliveries in all Group areas were above the previous year’s level, with Western and Southern Europe as well as Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia achieving the strongest growth. Asphalt deliveries increased by 1.5% to 8.2 million tonnes (previous year: 8.1).  #### Solid development of revenue and results  Group revenue in the period from January to September 2021 rose by 6.5% in comparison with the previous year to €13,996 million (previous year: 13,140). Excluding consolidation and exchange rate effects, the increase amounted to 8.5%. Changes to the scope of consolidation of €42 million and exchange rate effects of €202 million had a negative impact on revenue.  The result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation (RCOBD) grew by €165 million or 6.0% to €2,896 million (previous year: 2,731). Excluding consolidation and exchange rate effects, the increase amounted to €219 million and was thus 8.2% above the previous year. The rise in material costs, especially due to significantly higher energy prices, had a negative impact on the result. Energy costs increased by €196 million to €1,313 million (previous year: 1,117). The RCOBD margin, i.e. the ratio of result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation to revenue, remained almost unchanged at 20.7% (previous year: 20.8%).  The result from current operations (RCO) rose significantly by 13.9% to €1,953 million (previous year: 1,715). Changes to the scope of consolidation contributed €1 million, while exchange rate effects reduced the result by €34 million. Excluding consolidation and exchange rate effects, the result was 16.1% above the previous year.  #### Financial position  Net debt amounted to €7.1 billion (previous year: 7.9) as of 30 September 2021 and was down by €0.8 billion compared to 30 September 2020. The increase of €0.2 billion compared to the end of 2020 (€6.9 billion) is mainly due to the usual seasonal increase in working capital and the dividend payment in the second quarter.  #### Portfolio optimisation progresses  Thanks to several transactions in the course of the current year, HeidelbergCement has made good progress with its programme of portfolio optimisation within the framework of the “Beyond 2020” strategy.   At the beginning of October 2021, HeidelbergCement signed agreements to sell its regional aggregates and ready-mixed concrete activities in the Spanish regions of Catalonia, Madrid, and Asturias as well as its ready-mixed concrete business on the Balearic Islands to different buyers. On 26 October 2021, HeidelbergCement announced the signing of an agreement to acquire 68% of the shares in the Tanzanian cement producer Tanga Cement. With this step, the company further strengthens its local business and creates significant synergies with its existing assets in Tanzania.  #### Share buyback programme started  On 10 August 2021, HeidelbergCement launched its announced share buyback programme. The programme has a total amount of up to €1 billion and a term until 30 September 2023. The share buyback will be carried out in several tranches. The first tranche in the amount of €300 to €350 million is to be completed by January 2022 at the latest. By 29 October 2021, approximately 3.2 million own shares were acquired on the stock exchange at a total price of approximately €216.9 million.   #### Further progress towards climate neutrality  HeidelbergCement is making significant progress in CO2 capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies. HeidelbergCement, which is the first company to test CO2 capture in Eastern Europe, is testing a new enzyme-based technology for CO2 capture at the Górażdże cement plant in Poland as part of the cross-industry ACCSESS project. In September 2021, the British subsidiary Hanson UK successfully used a mix of 100% climate-neutral fuels including hydrogen for cement production on an industrial scale for the first time. In October 2021, the British government announced that Hanson UK and its partners in the HyNet North West consortium had been selected for implementation under the CCUS cluster funding. With these projects, HeidelbergCement is reaffirming its target of playing a leading role on the path to carbon neutrality.  #### Important step in digital transformation  On 28 September 2021, HeidelbergCement signed an agreement to acquire a minority stake of 45% in Command Alkon, the global leader in comprehensive supply chain technology solutions for building materials. The software investment company Thoma Bravo retains the majority ownership of Command Alkon. Together, HeidelbergCement, Thoma Bravo, and Command Alkon pursue the strategy of further developing best-in-class, cloud-based solutions for the entire supply chain and building the digital ecosystem of the future for the building materials industry.  #### Outlook 2021 partly raised  As already described in the Half-Year Financial Report 2021, the Managing Board had raised the outlook for the full year 2021. After the first nine months of 2021, the company confirms its expectation of a strong increase in the result from current operations before depreciation and amortisation and the result from current operations, in each case before exchange rate and consolidation effects, for the financial year 2021.   Over the course of the year, HeidelbergCement's capital efficiency (ROIC) and leverage ratio have continued to improve significantly. Against this backdrop, the company has raised its ROIC outlook to >9% (previously: clearly above 8%) and adjusted its forecast for the leverage ratio to below 1.5x (previously: at the lower end of 1.5-2.0x).  This outlook does not take into account the potential negative impact of a worsening COVID 19 situation.  #### Risks and opportunities  HeidelbergCement's risk policy is based on the business strategy, which is focused on safeguarding the Group's existence and sustainably increasing its value. The risk management process serves to identify these risks at an early stage and to systematically assess and limit them.  Risks that could have a significant impact on our net assets, financial performance and results of operations in the 2021 financial year and for the foreseeable future thereafter, as well as opportunities, are presented in detail in the 2020 Annual Report in the risk and opportunity report on page 65 ff.

{"id":7353,"text":"* ###### Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement, underlined the company’s focus on Carbon Capture and Utilisation or Storage (CCU\/S) as an important element of its decarbonisation strategy during German Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier’s state visit to Norway.    * ###### HeidelbergCement is building the world’s first full-scale carbon capture facility in Norway at the Brevik cement plant, aiming to capture 400,000 tonnes annually or 50% of the plant’s emissions from 2024 onwards.    * ###### The experience gained in Norway will be a significant benefit for the deployment of carbon capture technology at a large scale at other HeidelbergCement plants.    * ###### HeidelbergCement targets up to 10 million tonnes of CO2-reduction with several CCU\/S projects already underway by 2030.      Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement, was part of the official delegation accompanying German Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his state visit to Norway on 4 and 5 November. HeidelbergCement is currently building the world's first full-scale carbon capture facility at a cement plant. The facility located at the Brevik cement plant of the Norwegian subsidiary Norcem will be operational in 2024 and capture 400,000 tonnes annually or 50% of the plant’s emissions.  As part of the state visit, Dr. Dominik von Achten participated in a roundtable event at the Norwegian classification society DNV on the topic ”Energy Transition – From Fossil Fuels to Renewables,“ opened by Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the Norwegian Minister of Petroleum and Energy Marte Mjøs Persen. Dr. Dominik von Achten underlined HeidelbergCement’s strategic focus on Carbon Capture and Utilisation or Storage (CCU\/S), and the ambition to decarbonise the company until 2050 at the latest: “We are excited to be part of this pioneering project together with the Norwegian government. It enables us to further progress on our path towards carbon neutrality, thus reducing the carbon footprint of the building materials industry.“ Dr von Achten also had a separate meeting with Minister Mjøs Persen about the Norwegian Longship programme, in which the Brevik cement plant plays a central role.  Brevik is one of several cement plants where HeidelbergCement is currently testing different technologies and solutions to substantially reduce CO2 emissions. ”The experience from Norway will be highly important when we aim to implement carbon capture at a large scale in other cement plants,“ said Dr. Dominik von Achten: “We target CO2-reductions of up to 10 million tonnes with several CCU\/S projects already underway by 2030. One example is the CCS project at the Slite cement plant on the Swedish island of Gotland, announced in June 2021, which we are eager to drive forward.” The Slite plant of HeidelbergCement’s subsidiary Cementa could potentially capture 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 and become the worlds first climate-neutral cement plant.   The Chairman of HeidelbergCement’s Managing Board also expressed his views on energy transition in the cement industry: “We focus on a number of activities to reach our goals. They include further increasing the use of alternative fuels and improving energy efficiency, continuing promoting our CCU\/S activities, strengthening circular economy and developing innovative products. To realise our ambitious climate targets, we also need fast, decisive political action, clear framework conditions and streamlined funding procedures. With regard to Germany, stronger cooperation with Norway is essential. Fast provision of infrastructure for CO2 transport is a good example of an important step going forward.”  #### Information on Brevik CCS    * The Brevik CCS project is part of the Longship programme supported by the Norwegian government for full-scale carbon capture and storage.   * Brevik CCS is the first industrial-scale CCS projects to develop an open-access infrastructure to transport and store significant amounts of CO2 from across Europe.   * Norcem will capture 400,000 tonnes of CO2 per year and transport it by ship to an onshore terminal on the Norwegian west coast.    * From there, the liquefied CO2 will be transported by pipeline to a storage site under the North Sea, for permanent storage.

{"id":7364,"text":"* ###### The facility is expected to go into operation in 2025 and aims to show that 20% of the CO2 process emissions of the cement plant can be captured.     * ###### The potential capture capacity is designed for 20% of the total CO2 emissions, which would correspond to around 100,000 tonnes of CO2 annually.    * ###### To minimise the use of fossil energy for carbon capture, the project will also test the use of alternative fuels and electrical energy.     The LEILAC 2 (Low Emissions Intensity Lime And Cement) carbon capture project has successfully passed its Financial Investment Decision milestone, confirming that the project can now enter the implementation phase. Together with the Australian technology company Calix and a European consortium, HeidelbergCement will proceed to build a demonstration facility integrated into HeidelbergCement’s plant in Hanover, Germany. The installation will be designed to reduce 20 % of the CO2 emissions of the cement plant’s CO2 emissions, corresponding to around 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year .   With the patented LEILAC technology, the CO2 released during cement production can be captured in a highly pure form via a separate waste gas stream and used in other processes. As minimal additional energy is needed and no chemicals are required, this happens in an especially cost-efficient way. The technology can also be retrofitted in a modular form at any scale and use any fuel or energy source, including biomass, hydrogen, or electricity – providing a ‘future proof’ solution.   “LEILAC 2 is one of several carbon capture projects we are currently pursuing at HeidelbergCement,” says Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board. “We are very pleased to advance this key technology at industrial scale at our plant in Hanover, Germany.    Once the technology has been successfully tested, we will be able to plan and install the technology for the actual permanent capture of CO2 in a second step, taking into account the site conditions in Hanover and the quality requirements for the CO2 for further use. The site is also optimally located to enable transport of the captured CO2 for further use or offshore storage.\"   HeidelbergCement aims to achieve CO2 reductions of up to 10 million tonnes by 2030 with several CCUS projects.  As part of the prior LEILAC 1 project, a CO2 capture pilot installation with a capture capacity of 25,000 tonnes of CO2 per year had been developed at HeidelbergCement's Lixhe plant in Belgium. With LEILAC 2, an installation around four times as large will be operated in Hanover. The project now enters the detailed design phase through 2022, followed by procurement and construction of the plant itself. Construction is expected in 2023, dependent on flag points over the coming months. The project scope for LEILAC 2 also includes a thorough analysis of the potential destination of the captured CO2, either for utilisation purposes or for safe geological offshore storage.  Phil Hodgson, Calix MD and CEO and Chairman of the LEILAC Executive Board: “The start of the implementation phase marks a significant milestone and further demonstrates the momentum which is building around the LEILAC project. It is testament to the strong level of collaboration which has been cultivated between the consortium partners, who have all worked together to make significant progress on this breakthrough project.”   About LEILAC  The LEILAC consortium is led by the LEILAC Group (technology provider Calix), and comprises HeidelbergCement, CEMEX, Cimpor, IKN, Lhoist, Port of Rotterdam, BGR, RBINS-GSB, CERTH, POLIMI, LEAP, and Engie. It is supported by GCCA, GCCSI, CEMBUREAU, ECRA, University of Clausthal and EuLA. The project aims to apply and demonstrate a breakthrough technology that will enable Europe’s cement and lime industries to reduce their carbon footprint significantly.

{"id":7371,"text":"HeidelbergCement was awarded the German Innovation Award for Climate and Environment (IKU) in the category \"Process Innovations for Climate Protection\" for its innovative ReConcrete-360° concept. In ReConcrete-360°, demolished concrete is crushed using novel processes and selectively separated into its components: in addition to sand and gravel, hardened cement paste is also obtained in this way. This can be reused as a valuable, low-carbon raw material in clinker and cement production, where it can replace natural limestone - keeping with the principles of the circular economy. In addition, the hardened cement paste can absorb CO2, bind it permanently and thus act as a carbon sink.  Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement, said: \"Projects like ReConcrete-360° show what it means to re-think the circular economy - congratulations to our innovation and sustainability team!\"  Dr. Nicola Kimm, Member of the Managing Board and Chief Sustainability Officer of HeidelbergCement, said: “The IKU award shows that our research is making an important contribution to sustainable construction and thus to climate protection. Our ReConcrete-360° concept proves that concrete has the potential to be the most sustainable building product over its entire life cycle from production to recycling.”  Dr. Wolfgang Dienemann, Director Global R&D, said: ”With ReConcrete-360°, we have succeeded in developing a limestone substitute from demolished concrete that also allows us to use the carbon-containing exhaust gases from cement production. A small revolution with a big impact: In Germany alone, the CO2 savings potential through this process is ten million tonnes per year. The IKU award underlines that we can be proud of our pioneering innovation.”  The IKU is awarded this year by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action and honours outstanding environmental innovations by German companies and research institutions. A high-level jury chaired by Prof. Ottmar Edenhofer, Director at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), selected the winners in six categories. The jury's decision was based on the scientific evaluation by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI. The IKU is funded by the National Climate Initiative of the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Action. The prize money in each category is €25,000. In addition to HeidelbergCement, the company Grundfos GmbH also received an award in the category \"Process innovations for climate protection\" this year.

{"id":7376,"text":"* ###### HeidelbergCement and its Swedish subsidiary Cementa present positive results of a pre-feasibility study for the Slite CCS (carbon capture and storage) project    * ###### The installation at the Slite cement plant on the Swedish island of Gotland will be scaled to capture up to 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 annually, equalling 3% of the country’s total emissions     * ###### Slite CCS is the largest CCUS project yet for HeidelbergCement, and in the cement industry     HeidelbergCement and its Swedish subsidiary Cementa are stepping up their activities with one of Sweden's largest climate transition initiatives: At a press conference today, the promising results of the pre-feasibility study for a carbon capture and storage (CCS) facility at Cementa’s plant in Slite were presented. A new grant from the Swedish Energy Agency will support the next steps towards carbon-neutral cement production in Sweden by 2030.  “Just a few days ago, we published new sustainability targets, underlining the importance of CCUS as one key lever to almost halve our CO2 footprint by 2030 compared to 1990, and achieve Net Zero by 2050 at the latest,“ said Dr Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement: “Slite CCS is the largest CCUS project yet in our Group and the cement industry, and a model for what will be achievable with CCUS also beyond 2030. As this initiative contributes considerably to the climate ambitions of Sweden, and is a unique project for us in terms of scale, we are keen to make it happen.”   The Slite plant has a favorable location directly at a sea-harbor, and there are several storage solutions under development in the North Sea where Northern Lights is the most advanced today.  The installation at the Slite cement plant on the Swedish island of Gotland will be scaled to capture up to 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 annually, which corresponds to the plant’s total emissions and is equivalent to 3% of the country’s total emissions. Additionally, the use of biobased fuels in the cement production at Slite will be increased in line with HeidelbergCement’s commitment to significantly raise the share of biomass in the fuel mix. The full-scale capturing of the plant’s CO2 emissions is targeted by 2030.   In the pre-feasibility study, amine capture was found to be the most suitable technology. The implementation of the capture facility requires significant rebuilding and extension measures to the plant – a process that is starting now to meet the schedule. The power demand will also increase significantly.  “As we capture and store CO2 from the cement production, including emissions from bioenergy, we will be able to manufacture carbon-free cement for the Swedish construction industry. Regarding the project planning and execution, we will benefit greatly from our experience gained with the Brevik CCS project in Norway, which is under construction to be operational in 2024. We welcome and rely on the commitment and support from our partners, and are confident that we will solve important issues such as energy supply and co-financing as well,” said Giv Brantenberg, General Manager HeidelbergCement Northern Europe.

Conception lies with the environmental consultancy EPEA, a subsidiary of Drees & Sommer.   “Full circular economy and sustainable construction are central elements of our climate strategy,” says Dr Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement: “We want to continue to significantly reduce our carbon footprint in the coming years. In doing so, we are focusing on the life cycle assessment of our product, concrete – including the processing of demolished concrete and returning it to the construction cycle. By 2030, we want to offer circular alternatives for half of our concrete products. Together with the city of Heidelberg, also a pioneer in the area of climate protection, we want to use the Circular City project to demonstrate the enormous potential of concrete recycling for future urban construction.”  The goal is the complete economic and ecological analysis of the city's building inventory, which will be compiled in a digital material registry. The basis for the registry is the Urban Mining Screener developed by EPEA. This programme can estimate the composition of buildings at the push of a button, based on building data such as location, year of construction, building volume or building type. Based on this information, landfills and processing areas can, for example, be planned accordingly and local value creation can be triggered through local supply chains and new business models.   In the future, demolished concrete is no longer to be disposed of in landfills or roadbeds, but rather crushed and separated into its components using innovative processes and returned to the construction cycle. As part of the “ReConcrete 360°” project, HeidelbergCement is currently also working on a process to incorporate CO2 into recycled concrete, thereby reducing CO2 emissions in cement production.

Note: Sales and Current operating income are restated for 2011 and 2010 to reflect the reclassification of the Gypsum activities to discontinued operations. Group Highlights. * Current operating income grew in the fourth quarter from higher sales volumes, higher pricing, and cost cutting measures. For the year, higher cost inflation and the negative impact of foreign exchange lowered overall results. * The Group successfully achieved its €2 billion net debt reduction target and strengthened its already solid liquidity. The strategic divestment of Gypsum assets generated a net gain of €466 million. * Cost savings accelerated at the end of 2011, with €100 million delivered in the fourth quarter achieving €250 million for the full year, well above the €200 million target. As part of the announced program to reduce costs by €500 million, the Group plans to reach at least €400 million of savings in 2012. * Net earnings were impacted by a non-cash goodwill write-off of €285 million, mainly in Greece. * The Group will implement in 2012 its new country-based organization project to accelerate organic growth and innovation and reinforce efficiency. Bruno Lafont, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lafarge, said:. > \"In 2011 the Group met its debt reduction target of 2 billion euros despite a very challenging environment. Additional debt reduction will come in 2012 as the Group maximizes its operational cash flows. We will drive a €500 million cost reduction program, implement price actions as a response to cost inflation, further reduce capital expenditures to €800 million, execute strategic divestments of more than €1 billion, and propose a reduction of the dividend to 50 cents per share. > Further to the divestment of a majority of the gypsum assets and the fundamental changes to the management structure, the Group has fully refocused on its core businesses of cement, aggregates and concrete. This strategic shift will accelerate growth and innovation.\" >. > Outlook. Overall the Group sees cement demand moving higher and estimates market growth of between 1 to 4 percent in 2012 versus 2011. Emerging markets are the main driver of demand growth and Lafarge benefits from its well balanced geographic spread of high quality assets.

{"id":7395,"text":"* Higher operating EBITDA \"like-for-like\". * Better prices in all segments and in the four large Group regions. * Asia and Latin America continue to grow. * Harsh winter dampens construction in Europe. * Increasing demand in North America. * Program to further strengthen market and cost leadership. Due to good economic conditions in Asia and Latin America and growing demand for construction materials in North America and Africa Middle East consolidated cement deliveries increased. Higher shipments were achieved particularly by the Group companies in India, the US, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia as well as in Russia and Azerbaijan. However, in contrast to last year's mild climate, the harsh winter brought many construction sites in Western and Eastern Europe to a temporary standstill in February. Hence, sales volumes decreased in this Group region in all segments and impacted first quarter results. Holcim achieved better prices in various markets. Overall, the Group achieved an operating EBITDA close to last year, and like-for-like operating EBITDA growth reached 5.5 percent. Sales development and financial results. Consolidated cement sales increased by 6.2 percent to 35.2 million tonnes, and deliveries of aggregates were down by 7.8 percent to 31.6 million tonnes. Volumes of ready-mix concrete decreased by 0.3 percent to 10.4 million cubic meters, and asphalt sales declined by 18.4 percent to 1.4 million tonnes. With shipments of cement up by more than 1.8 million tonnes, Asia Pacific was well ahead in terms of volume, mainly due to India. In aggregates, Group region Africa Middle East achieved the highest growth rate. In ready-mix concrete, North America recorded the highest volume growth, mainly due to the full incorporation of Lattimore Materials in Texas in March of last year, and the first-time consolidation of Ennstone in Virginia in November 2011. A positive development is the fact that Holcim was able to mostly pass on cost increases through higher sales prices in all segments and in all Group regions, with the exception of Africa Middle East. Consolidated net sales increased by 2.2 percent to CHF 4.8 billion. In absolute terms, Asia Pacific ranked first with net sales of CHF 2.2 billion. Operating EBITDA was almost stable with a decline of 1.1 percent to CHF 745 million. The negative weather effects in Europe could be almost entirely absorbed. It is worthwhile to note that energy and transport costs somewhat stabilized. With the exception of Europe, all Group regions performed better. The Group grew like-for-like by 5.5 percent. Net income of CHF 116 million almost reached the previous year's level, and Group net income attributable to shareholders of Holcim Ltd rose by 1.2 percent to CHF 10 million. Due to the seasonal pattern of the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities amounted to a negative CHF 474 million, an improvement of 11.8 percent compared to the previous year's reporting period. The last 12 months have seen net financial debt decrease 4.9 percent to CHF 11.8 billion. The sale of Holcim shares contributed an amount of CHF 296 million. Outlook. Holcim expects demand for building materials to rise in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, as well as in Russia and Azerbaijan in 2012. A slight improvement for North America can also be expected. In Europe, demand should remain stable, provided that the situation is not undermined by further systemic shocks. In any case, Holcim will accord cost management the closest attention, and pass on inflation-induced cost increases. Holcim's approach to new investments will be cautious. Holcim expects that the Group will achieve organic growth at operating EBITDA level. Program to further strengthen market and cost leadership. A program to further strengthen market and cost leadership will be announced next week, after the respective measures are concluded at the Group Management Meeting.

{"id":7396,"text":"Program to further strengthen market and cost leadership to generate additional operating profit of at least CHF 1.5 billion by end of 2014. To sustainably improve the return on invested capital, Holcim Ltd is launching a program to further strengthen market and cost leadership. The Executive Committee and the management of the Group companies are together starting the \"Holcim Leadership Journey\" with specific measures to increase operating profit by at least CHF 1.5 billion by the end of 2014. The base line is the financial year 2011 (excluding 2011 one-off charges of CHF 375 million and without fluctuations in currency, changes in scope of consolidation and under similar market conditions). CEO Bernard Fontana: \"After intensive discussions at the senior management level and based on close collaboration with the Group companies, I am confident that we will achieve these targets. At least CHF 150 million positive impact will be achieved in 2012.\" The \"Holcim Leadership Journey\" focuses on the following areas:. * Customer Excellence by improving customer focus and innovation. * Cost Leadership:. * Increasing energy efficiency and the use of alternative fuels and raw materials. * Reducing logistics costs. * Streamlining of the procurement process globally. * Increasing fixed costs savings. * Further reduction of net working capital and selective divestments. * Reduction of the investment cost per tonne of new cement capacity. * Further development and generation of talents and leaders as well as strengthening of the social dialogue with all stakeholders. * The realization of this program anticipates one-off costs of less than CHF 200 million. Customer Excellence by improving customer focus and innovation (additional operating profit by end of 2014: CHF 500 million). The focus will be on measures to strengthen the management of customer value and loyalty, margin and prices as well as sales force. Furthermore, Holcim will implement standardized performance indicators across the whole Group to measure the progress in marketing and sales. Customers will benefit from Holcim’s increased understanding of their needs. The Group’s ability to innovate in fields such as integrated market solutions, new materials, or low CO2 solutions will enable it to fully meet those customer needs with improved products and services. Increasing energy efficiency and the use of alternative fuels and raw materials (additional operating profit by end of 2014: > CHF 300 million). Holcim will increase its energy efficiency and the use of alternative fuels and raw materials. Various measures are planned: from clinker grinding improvements and kiln burner updates, to optimization of the fuel mix in cement production as well as initiatives in the field of energy procurement. The cost reduction measures will be supported by some \"fast return\" Capex projects. Reduction of logistics costs (additional operating profit by end of 2014:. > CHF 250 million). Transportation of raw materials and transportation of products to customers are significant cost factors. Holcim sees a substantial cost reduction potential through optimized truck cycles, the reduction of the waiting time for trucks and optimization of routes based on real-time GPS equipment, not only to construction sites, but also between plants and distribution units. Furthermore, Holcim will review third party transportation contracts. Streamlining of the procurement process globally (additional operating profit by end of 2014: > CHF 250 million). At the forefront are measures to improve processes, standardization, planning and volume pooling of procurement and a diversification of the supplier base in all geographical areas, including China. It is planned to strengthen the sourcing platforms on different levels (regional, global) and to re-negotiate existing contracts. Increasing fixed costs savings (additional operating profit by end of 2014:. > CHF 200 million). Holcim will reduce support process costs across all levels of the company and make better use of existing service centers and support units to reduce the use of external services and consultants. Additionally, Holcim will review the entire asset base across all segments with low utilization levels. In this context, the size of the local footprint will also be reviewed. Further reduction of net working capital and selective divestments. In addition to further reduction of net working capital, also selective divestments may occur. Reduction of the investment cost per tonne of new cement capacity. For future expansion projects, the total investment cost per tonne of new capacity cement will be reduced by 20 percent, based upon regional reference costs, by reviewing design standards, optimizing equipment procurement and broadening the supplier base. Further development and generation of talents and leaders as well as strengthening of the social dialogue with all stakeholders. Due to Holcim’s excellent geographic diversification, growth will continue. To support this growth, the Group needs a broad range of talents and experienced leaders in management roles and functions. The \"Holcim Leadership Journey\" will strengthen the development of talents and managers as well as the social dialogue with all stakeholders. Furthermore, Holcim will continue to give highest priority to occupational health and safety with the goal of \"zero harm to people\". * * * * * * *.

{"id":7401,"text":"Lafarge presents 34 new sustainable development ambitions for 2020. Lafarge has entered a new phase in its sustainability commitment with the launch today of SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS 2020. The 34 new sustainability ambitions are organized around the three main pillars of sustainable development - social, economic and environmental \\- and they are coupled with demanding quantitative targets. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bruno Lafont comments:. \"SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS 2020 is the continuation of our 2007-12 programme, at the end of which we had achieved our key commitment of reducing net CO2 emissions per ton of cement produced by 20%. I firmly believe that a green economy cannot happen without a green industry, and there is no sustainability without a responsible industry, aware of its social contribution and steering its own change. With this programme, which comprises 34 new ambitions, we are looking to create value for all of our stakeholders - shareholders, customers, employees and local communities in the vicinity of our production plants. These ambitions define our commitments for the future and our contribution to a sustainable society.\" Lafarge's 34 ambitions include nine major ambitions to be achieved by 2020:. 1\\. Reduce by 33% our CO2 emissions per ton of cement compared to 1990 levels 2. Use 50% of non-fossil fuels in our cement plants by 2020 (including 30% biomass) 3. Have 20% of our concrete containing reused and recycled materials 4. Reach zero fatalities and virtually eliminate lost-time incidents for our employees and contractors 5. Having 35% of senior management positions held by women 6. Contribute 1 million volunteer hours per year to locally selected projects 7. Having 75% of our country operations implementing a plan for local job creation 8. Enable access to affordable and sustainable housing for 2 million people 9. Generate sales of €3 billion a year in new sustainable solutions, products and services. These ambitions are the result of an extensive collaborative approach. Over 18 months, Lafarge has involved employees and managers of operating units, the panel of stakeholders, major partners such as WWF and CARE and our International Advisory Board, asking them both what they expected of their company and what contribution Lafarge could make to society. Sustainable development: a long-standing and lasting commitment. For many years, Lafarge has been working to set an example of leadership in business sustainability in terms of protecting the environment, social responsibility and corporate governance. In 2000, Lafarge was the first manufacturer in the construction materials sector to publicly set targets for reducing CO2 emissions. In 2001, it was one of the first CAC 40 companies to publish a comprehensive report on its sustainable development efforts and to form fundamental partnerships with organisations like WWF and CARE. Since 2007, the Group has implemented a sustainability Ambitions programme that sets out its priorities and measurable commitments. General information. Located in 64 countries with 68,000 employees, Lafarge is a world leader in building materials, with top-ranking positions in its Cement, Aggregates & Concrete businesses. In 2011, Lafarge posted sales of €15.3 billion.

Group highlights. * Sales increased for the quarter and year-to-date, driven by successful price actions across all product lines to respond to cost inflation. * The Group achieved €170 million of cost savings in the first-half, €100 million in the second quarter, and is on track to reach at least €400 million for the year. * EBITDA and current operating income rose in the quarter and year-to-date, driven by double digit growth in Middle East and Africa, Asia, Latin America, and North America. Margins also improved both in the quarter and the first-half, up 130 basis points when excluding carbon credit sales. * The Group recorded a non-recurring charge of €200 million in the second quarter for the impairment of Greek assets and recorded €148 million of restructuring charges in the first-half to implement its cost savings initiatives. * Net income Group share decline impacted by asset impairment and restructuring charges. Excluding these charges, net income group share and earnings per share improved 15 year-to-date. * Net debt of €12.5 billion reduced by €1.7 billion from June 30, 2011, and strong liquidity further improved through the issuance in July of €675 million mid-term bonds with no financial covenants and interest rates below 6 percent. Bruno Lafont, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lafarge, said:. > \"Economic conditions remain challenging for many parts of the world and we remain prudent on our outlook. But even in a lower growth volume environment, our actions to generate sales growth and cash, and to improve returns, led to a third consecutive quarter of positive trends. >. > These actions will continue as we implement cost savings of at least €400 million in 2012, drive sales growth and higher margin products and services through innovation, and extract more out of our assets with strict capital discipline. We confirm our objective to secure at least €1 billion of divestments this year as part of improving returns and reducing net debt to less than €10 billion as soon as possible in 2013.\" > Outlook. Overall the Group continues to see cement demand moving higher and maintains its estimated market growth of between 1 to 4 percent in 2012 versus 2011. Emerging markets continue to be the main driver of demand and Lafarge benefits from its well balanced geographic spread of high quality assets. We expect higher pricing for the year and that cost inflation will increase at a lower rate than in 2011. Consolidated accounts as of June 30, 2012. The Board of Directors of Lafarge, chaired by Bruno Lafont, met on July 26, 2012 and approved the accounts for the period ended June 30, 2012.

Sales volumes for cement, aggregates and concrete slightly declined in the quarter and year-to-date. For cement, sales volumes decreased 3 in the quarter and 1 year-to-date, reflecting divestments and volume declines primarily in Western and Central and Eastern Europe that were partially offset by improvements in North America and Asia. Aggregates sales volumes declined by 1 in the quarter and 2 year-to-date, reflecting lower construction activity in Western Europe. Concrete volumes declined by 7 for both periods due to the sale of US readymix assets in the third quarter 2011, creating a higher base comparison. On a like-for-like basis, readymix concrete sales volumes were stable. Consolidated sales moved higher, up 5 for both periods, supported by successful price actions to respond to cost inflation across all of our product lines, higher cement volumes in North America and Asia, and favorable foreign exchange. EBITDA improved for the quarter and year-to-date, up 8 . Double digit EBITDA increases in Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Asia, and North America supported this growth. Declines occurred in Western and Central & Eastern Europe due to the impact of poor weather conditions in the early part of the year, €51 million of lower proceeds from the sale of carbon credits in the first-half compared to last year, and a challenging economic environment. Overall, cost reduction actions contributed €170 million to the results for the first-half. Net Income Group Share declined to €57 million in the quarter and to €13 million for the first-half. The decrease was primarily due to a €200 million second quarter pre-tax impairment charge on Greek assets resulting from the sustained downturn in economic conditions. In addition, the Group recorded €54 million of pre-tax restructuring charges in the quarter (€148 million in the first-half) as part of the implementation of the Group's cost savings program. Net debt declined by €1.7 billion relative to June 2011 and moved higher compared to year-end 2011 due to normal seasonal working capital needs and exchange rates. Investments, divestments and liquidity. Investments totaled €298 million for the first-half 2012, down from €566 million in the first half 2011. * Sustaining capital expenditures remained stable at €110 million versus €122 million in 2011. * Internal development capital expenditures and acquisitions declined from €444 million in the first-half 2011 to €188 million in the first-half 2012. Lafarge received €72 million in cash for divestments in the first-half 2012, including sales of minority stakes, and plans to divest more than €1 billion in 2012. As of June 30, 2012, Lafarge SA had €3.4 billion in undrawn committed credit lines, with an average maturity of about 3 years, in addition to €2.6 billion of cash on hand. Additional information.

{"id":7424,"text":"Lafarge has successfully completed an industrial trial for Aether®, its new generation clinker formulated for lower carbon cements. The trial mobilized a team of around 100 people over a 10-day period at the Group's plant in Le Teil, France. It allowed the production of 10,000 tons of Aether® clinker, confirming the feasibility of industrial-scale production using traditional raw materials. The launch of the first Aether® products is planned for 2014. Aether®, a new clinker formulation to reduce the carbon footprint of cement. The result of several years of research by Lafarge R&D teams, Aether® is a new generation clinker, the basic component of cement. Aether® cements offer similar properties to ordinary Portland Cement and can be produced in traditional cement plants after minor process adjustments, for a lower overall environmental footprint. Aether® is a new chemical composition for clinker which should allow a 25 to 30% reduction in CO2 emissions, thanks to:. * reduced limestone content in the raw mix,. * a lower temperature (~1300°C) during the burning process,. * easier grinding, using less energy. This development project has received the support of the European Union as part of its LIFE+ Programme, a financial instrument to support environmental projects. Lafarge has been working to reduce its CO2 emissions for over 20 years, using alternative fuels, cementitious additives and improving energy efficiency at its plants. Project Aether shows Lafarge's determination to go even further in reducing its CO2 emissions. This project will contribute to the Group's objective to reduce these emissions by 33% per ton of cement by 2020, as part of its Sustainability Ambitions 2020.

Excluding one-off items(1), net income group share increased 70 to €772m, or €2.69 per share. * Dividend of €1 per share, subject to AGM approval. ##### Group highlights. * Sales increased 3.5 year-to-date, driven by successful price actions across all product lines to respond to cost inflation and by growth in emerging markets. * The Group delivered on its cost savings target, achieving €410 million in the year; innovation plan roll out is gaining pace and actions generated €80 million of EBITDA in 2012. * EBITDA and current operating income rose 7 and 12 respectively in the periods presented despite the continued slowdown in Europe. Operations outside of Europe generated more than 75 of the Group's EBITDA and rose 17 in the quarter and 19 year-to-date. Group EBITDA margin improved 130 basis points in both periods when excluding carbon credit sales. * Net income Group share reached €432 million for the year, down 27 mainly because of the one-time €466 million gain related to gypsum divestments in 2011.

(1) Asset impairment in Q2 2012 on Greece and in Q4 2011 on Western Europe and the Emirates, restructuring charges, and one-time gains in 2011 on Gypsum divestments. #####. Bruno Lafont, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lafarge, said:. \"We have delivered on our objectives for 2012 and our results grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by strong operational performance and growth in emerging markets which generated close to 60 of our sales. We are progressing fast and I am convinced that we will deliver most of our 2012-2015 plan to generate €1.75 billion additional EBITDA through cost reduction and innovation measures by the end of 2014, close to one year ahead of our initial objective. We target to deliver €650 million additional EBITDA from these measures in 2013. Whilst we adopt a cautious stance on the current market environment, our actions will drive net debt reduction to below €10 billion as soon as possible in 2013. Going forward we will continue to extract the full potential of our uniquely diversified portfolio of high quality assets, selectively investing in organic growth in our core markets. All our actions strive towards growth in sales, earnings, return on capital employed and cash flows and my priority is to maximize value creation for our shareholders\". ##### Outlook. Overall the Group sees cement demand moving higher and estimates market growth of between 1 to 4 percent in 2013 versus 2012. Emerging markets continue to be the main driver of demand and Lafarge benefits from its well-balanced geographic spread of high quality assets. We expect higher pricing for the year and that cost inflation will continue, although at a slightly lower rate than in 2012. The Group maintains its target of reducing net debt to below €10 billion as soon as possible in 2013. Capital expenditures will be limited initially to €800 million in 2013. Additional divestments beyond the current target of €1 billion since the beginning of 2012 may lead to an increase of this expenditures level while maintaining our debt reduction objective. ##### Consolidated accounts as of December 31, 2012.

(*) EBITDA is defined as the current operating income before depreciation and amortization on tangible and intangible assets and is a non-GAAP financial measure. #####. Sales development and financial results. Sales volumes declined year-to-date, affected by the construction slowdown in Europe. However, solid domestic growth in Asia, Latin America and most countries of Middle East Africa largely mitigated this decline. In the fourth quarter, unfavorable weather conditions in the northern hemisphere, notably in the United States and in Central and Eastern Europe, weighed on volume trends. Consolidated sales moved higher, up 3.5 year-to-date, supported by successful price actions to respond to cost inflation across all our product lines, higher cement volumes in Latin America and Asia, and favorable foreign exchange effects. EBITDA improved 7 for both periods presented, supported by growth in Middle East & Africa, Latin America, Asia, and North America and favorable foreign exchange. Declines occurred in Western and Central & Eastern Europe due to the impact of poor weather conditions in the first and fourth quarters, €78 million of lower proceeds from the sale of carbon credits year-to-date compared to last year, and a challenging economic environment. The Group continued to implement its performance and innovation measures; cost reduction actions contributed €410 million and innovation generated €80 million to year-to-date results. Net income Group share declined, reflecting mostly a higher base comparison due to the one-off gains recorded in 2011 on the gypsum divestments. Excluding one-off items(1) , net income Group share improved 70 year-to-date to €772 million. At €11.3 billion, net debt declined by €0.9 billion in the quarter and €0.7 billion compared to December 2011. (1) Asset impairment in Q2 2012 on Greece and in Q4 2011 on Western Europe and the Emirates, restructuring charges, and one-time gains in 2011 on Gypsum divestments. #####. Investments, divestments and Liquidity. Investments totaled €817 million for year-to-date 2012, down from €1.2 billion in 2011. * Sustaining capital expenditure was stable, at €392 million versus €389 million in 2011. * Internal development capital expenditure and acquisitions declined to €425 million in 2012 from €810 million in 2011. Lafarge received €474 million in cash from divestments through 2012, including sales of minority stakes and the divestment of assets in Missouri and Oklahoma (USA). Close to €900 million of divestments have been secured to date.

{"id":7443,"text":"Holcim intends to streamline the ownership structure of its operations in India in order to strengthen the existing platform and create value for all stakeholders. Through intragroup restructuring, Holcim will increase its shareholding in Ambuja Cements Ltd. (\"Ambuja\") to 61.39 and Ambuja in turn will acquire Holcim’s 50.01 stake in ACC Ltd. (\"ACC\"). Both Ambuja and ACC will continue to operate as separate entities with their own brands and go-to-market strategies. However, the restructuring will allow for closer back-end cooperation between the companies as well as simplify the group structure. The Board of Ambuja and Holcim have agreed that the transaction will be effected through a merger of Holcim India Private Ltd. (\"HIPL\"), a wholly owned financial holding subsidiary, with Ambuja. HIPL currently directly holds a 9.76 stake in Ambuja and a 50.01 stake in ACC. In a two stage deal, Ambuja will first acquire, through a purchase, a 24 stake in HIPL for a cash consideration of INR 35,000 million (USD ~600 million), followed by a stock merger between HIPL and Ambuja. As part of the merger, Holcim will receive 584 million new equity shares of Ambuja resulting in an increase of its ownership in Ambuja from the current 50.55 to 61.39 . The transaction is subject to Ambuja’s shareholder and regulatory approvals in India. In addition, Holcim is committing to the Marwar Mundwa expansion project in North-Central India with an overall capacity of 4.5 MTPA. Holcim is also evaluating additional brown and greenfield investment proposals, such as in ACC Tikaria and Ametha, and will continue to look for opportunities to further optimize its Group structure in India. \"This transaction further improves Holcim's holding structure in India, strengthens the platform for future growth and is expected to generate synergy benefits of INR 9,000 million (USD 150 million) per annum. These benefits, which will be realized in a phased manner over two years, will be shared by both companies equally through supply chain, shared services and fixed costs optimization.

Group Highlights. * Volume trends improved month after month in the third quarter, sustained by ongoing growth in most emerging markets, the recovery in the United States and Europe stabilizing at a low level. On the other hand, the third quarter was marked by adverse exchange rates which had a negative impact of 7 on both sales and EBITDA (respectively €-286 million and €-67 million in the quarter). * Q3 EBITDA grew 4 at constant scope and exchange rates, benefiting notably from a solid performance in North America, Middle East \/ Africa and Asia. EBITDA margins improved 50 basis points on a like for like basis and excluding CO2, supported by higher volumes, firm prices and the acceleration of cost reductions and innovation measures which generated respectively €130 million and €80 million additional EBITDA in the quarter. In the first nine months, these measures have generated a total of €470 million (€290 million from cost reductions and €180 million from innovation measures), and the Group is on track with its plan. * Net debt at the end of September, at €10.9 billion, was reduced by €1.3 billion compared to end of September last year and by €0.9 billion in the quarter, notably thanks to divestments made at attractive multiples. * The Group confirms its objective to deliver its 2012-2015 plan by the end of 2014, with at least €600 million of EBITDA coming from cost reduction and innovation measures in 2014. * It announces new objectives beyond 2014 and plans to generate at least €1.1 billion of additional EBITDA from its actions in 2015-2016, of which €600 million from cost reductions and €500 million from innovation. This represents a minimum objective of €550 million per annum. ###. Bruno Lafont, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lafarge, said:. \"With improving volume trends and despite the adverse effect of exchange rates, we continued to progress in the third quarter on our strategic action plan. We have reduced net debt by more than one billion euros compared to September last year, and our cost reduction and innovation actions delivered results in line with our 2013 objectives. We have accelerated and will complete our 2012-2015 cost reduction and innovation plan one year ahead of our initial objective. Building on this momentum, we today announce new cost reduction and innovation targets for 2015-2016, targeting at least €1.1 billion of incremental EBITDA over that period. Combined with the utmost discipline in terms of capital allocation, our measures will drive the strengthening of our financial structure so as to return to an investment grade status as soon as possible, reducing net debt below €10 billion in 2013 and below €9 billion in 2014. Looking ahead, we will benefit from three organic growth drivers: continuing growth in emerging countries, accelerating growth through innovation and progressive recovery in mature markets. We will capture this potential thanks to our high-quality and well spread portfolio of assets and to our competitive edge in innovation which ensures the development of a value-added offer of products and services to address the evolving needs of our customers. All our measures strive towards growth in sales, cash flows and returns and our priority is to create sustainable value for our shareholders.\" ###. Outlook. Overall, Lafarge sees cement growth in its markets of between 0 to 3 percent in 2013 versus 2012. This implies better trends in H2 compared to H1 as market recovery is becoming evident in the United States, growth in most emerging markets continues and Europe is showing stabilization at a low level. Higher pricing is expected for the year. Cost inflation continues, although at a lower rate than in 2012, benefiting from positive trends in coal and petcoke prices and reduced general inflation in developed countries. The Group targets to deliver additional EBITDA of €650 million in 2013 through its cost reduction and innovation measures. As stated, the objective is to reduce net debt to below €10 billion in 2013, and below €9 billion in 2014. ###. Consolidated Accounts as at September 30, 2013. The Board of Directors of Lafarge, chaired by Bruno Lafont, met on November 5, 2013 and approved the accounts for the period ended September 30, 2013.

(1) At constant scope and exchange rates. ###. Sales Development and Financial Results. Volumes improved in the third quarter, supported by continuing growth in most of the Group's emerging markets, as well as volume catch up in the United States as the recovery materializes after a first-half affected by adverse weather in our regions. Consolidated sales decreased 4 in the third quarter affected by adverse foreign exchange. At constant scope and exchange rates they grew 4 , supported by higher volumes and improved prices across all product lines to address cost inflation. EBITDA was also impacted by adverse exchange rates, notably in Brazil, India, South Africa and Canada. At constant scope and exchange rates, Q3 EBITDA increased 4 . Cost reduction and innovation actions more than offset cost inflation, an adverse €28 million impact of the reduction of our inventories in the quarter and the absence of carbon credit sales in Q3 2013 (vs. CO2 proceeds of €23 million in Q3 2012). Cement prices were sequentially stable from Q2 to Q3 2013 and are up 2 year on year in the first nine months. The Group continued to actively increase prices although the impact on EBITDA was limited by price adjustments in a limited number of countries and adverse mix effects. Net income Group Share in the quarter, at €304 million remained stable compared to Q3 2012, despite the negative impact of foreign exchange on EBITDA and the absence of CO2 sales. Net debt now stands at €10.9 billion, a drop by €1.3 billion relative to the end of September last year. Compared to year-end 2012, it decreased €0.4 billion despite the usual impact of seasonality. This reflects strict capex discipline and divestments but also a solid improvement of working capital performance, notably thanks to a reduction in inventories. Compared to the end of September 2012, the working capital when expressed as a number of days of sales has been reduced by 6 days, bringing it to a historical low at this point in the year. ###. Divestments and Investments. In the quarter Lafarge received €0.9 billion from divestments, notably from the sale of its gypsum operations in the US (€0.5 billion) and its cement operations in Ukraine (€0.1 billion) made at attractive multiples. Divestments also include €0.2 billion received from our new partner in India to contribute to the Group's development in this country. Since the beginning of the year, cash from divestments reached €1.0 billion. With the most recent divestments announced, the Group has secured €1.7 billion (1) of divestments since January 1st 2012 and it shall continue to pursue further value creative divestments. Investments totaled €237 million for the quarter. * Sustaining capital expenditures amounted to €94 million. * Development investments amounted to €143 million in the third quarter of 2013. It included investments in the plants of Exshaw (Western Canada) and Ravena (New York, United States) and in the new cement plant projects in Kaluga (Russia) and Rajasthan (India). Our plant in Rajasthan (2.6 million tonnes) was recently commissioned and has started its operations in October. Reaping the benefits of our debottlenecking investments, we are starting additional capacities in the Philippines, Brazil (Rio) and Algeria (total of 1.8 million tonnes) which are progressively ramping up and support volume growth in these countries. Going forward, the Group plans to continue to seize growth opportunities for its uniquely diversified portfolio, selectively investing in its core markets. (1) Excluding €0.2bn capital injection of our new partner in India, completed in Q3 2013. ### Additional information.

The Group implemented targeted actions to promote innovation and reduce costs and debt. These measures continue to gain momentum and I am confident that we are particularly well positioned to succeed and deliver on our objectives in 2014 and beyond. Looking at 2014, we are determined and confident, and we expect an overall growth in our markets of between 2 to 5 percent. In this improving environment, the Group will take full advantage of its three organic growth drivers: emerging markets, where construction trends continue to be very favorable, accelerated growth through innovation and the progressive recovery of developed economies, starting with North America. We will continue to apply the utmost discipline in capital allocation and our aim is to return to an investment grade profile this year. In line with this objective and targeting a step-improvement in our return on capital employed, we will pursue the development of our most promising positions through selective organic investments. We notably plan to add more than 10 million tonnes of cement capacity in existing locations in the coming four years in Sub-Saharan Africa, to further reinforce our leadership position in this region and benefit from accelerated growth.\" ##### Outlook. Overall, Lafarge sees cement growth in its markets of between 2 to 5 percent in 2014 versus 2013. Markets shall increasingly benefit from the recovery in the United States and the continuing growth in emerging markets as Europe overall stabilizes. Cost inflation should continue at a similar pace as in 2013, which should result in higher prices overall. The Group targets to deliver additional EBITDA of above €600 million in 2014 through its cost reduction and innovation measures (above €400 million from cost savings and more than €200 million from innovation). Beyond 2014, in 2015-2016, it plans to generate at least €1.1 billion of additional EBITDA from its actions of which €600 million from cost reductions and €500 million from innovation. This represents a minimum objective of €550 million per annum. The Group is also aiming to reduce net debt below €9 billion in 2014. ##### Consolidated Accounts as at December 31, 2013.

Volumes increased again in the fourth quarter, as the more positive market trends experienced in Q3 continued to prevail. The Group's volumes benefited from the continuing recovery in the residential market in the United States and by sustained growth in Middle East and Africa and in Asia. At the same time, Europe showed stabilizing volumes for the second consecutive quarter. Consolidated sales decreased 2% in the fourth quarter, still affected by adverse foreign exchange (-7.5%, or €-259 million), notably in Brazil, India, South Africa and Canada. At constant scope and exchange rates sales grew 5%, supported by higher volumes and improved prices to address cost inflation across all product lines. Q4 EBITDA was also impacted by exchange rates (-8%, or €-63 million), one-time gains in Q4 2012 (total of €39 million) and lower CO2 sales (€14 million in Q4 2013 vs. €30 million in Q4 2012). On a like for like basis, Q4 EBITDA increased 14%, notably supported by North America and Middle East Africa which improved by respectively 26% and 10%. The acceleration of our cost reduction and innovation actions more than offset cost inflation and the total adverse €20 million impact of the further reduction of our inventories in the fourth quarter. Cement prices were sequentially stable from Q3 to Q4 2013 and were up 2% year on year. In 2013, the Group actively increased prices although the impact on EBITDA was limited by price adjustments in a small number of countries and adverse mix effects. Net income Group Share in the quarter, at €213 million benefited from the gain on the divestment of the Group's operations in Honduras (€172 million, net of tax). Net debt was reduced by €1 billion over the year as the Group continued to take targeted actions to deleverage, and stood at €10.3 billion on December 31. Since then, we have secured €380 million of divestments which have already been finalized. These divestments include the 20% remaining stake in the Gypsum joint-venture with Etex and Maryland assets. Strict capex discipline, divestments and some improvement in working capital performance contributed to this debt reduction. ##### Investments and Divestments. Investments totaled €306 million for the quarter. * Sustaining capital expenditures amounted to €172 million. * Development investments amounted to €134 million. It included investments in the plants of Exshaw (Western Canada) and Ravena (New York, United States) and in the new cement plant projects in Kaluga (Russia) and Rajasthan (India). Our plant in Rajasthan (2.6 million tonnes) started its operations in October. Reaping the benefits of our debottlenecking investments, we have also started additional capacities in the Philippines, Brazil (Rio) and Algeria (total of 1.8 million tonnes) which are progressively ramping up allowing us to seize market growth in these countries. With the sale of Honduras completed in the fourth quarter, proceeds from divestments received by the Group in 2013 reached €1.3 billion. Divestments mainly included the sale of US gypsum assets, a few aggregates quarries in the United States and cement assets in Ukraine and in Honduras, all made in attractive conditions. It also includes €0.2 billion received from our new partner in India to contribute to the Group's development in this country. Going forward, the Group shall continue to pursue further value creative divestments. ##### Additional information.

It would operate under the local governance rules with a board composed with equal numbers of Lafarge and Holcim directors and through an efficient distribution of central corporate functions in France and Switzerland. The Chairman of the new board would be Wolfgang Reitzle, future Chairman of Holcim. Bruno Lafont, Chairman and CEO of Lafarge would become CEO of the new group and member of the board. Thomas Aebischer, Holcim’s CFO would become CFO of the new group. Jean-Jacques Gauthier, Lafarge’s CFO would become Chief Integration Officer of the new group. The Executive Committee would be formed from both Lafarge and Holcim management. In order to ensure efficient execution of the merger, an integration committee will prepare the integration plan to be implemented straight after the closing of the transaction. Bernard Fontana, Holcim CEO will remain in charge of Holcim until completion of the transaction. He will co-chair the integration committee. The proposed merger would enable optimized capital allocation across the expanded footprint to drive improved ROCE, and strong cash-flow generation and the robust balance sheet will provide financial strength. LafargeHolcim will maintain an attractive dividend policy.

First Quarter Key Figures*. As required by IFRS 11, applicable as at January 1, 2014, the 2013 figures have been restated (more information below). * Sales down 2 to €2,633m (up 9 like for like). * Stable EBITDA at €343m (up 21 like for like). * Current operating income up 14 to €146m (up 69 like for like). * Net result group share at €-135m (€-0.47 per share), vs. €-117m in Q1 2013 (€-0.41 per share). *like for like variations are calculated excluding the impact of scope, exchange rates and a €20m one-time gain recorded in Q1 2013. Note that first quarter results reflect seasonality. Q1 results are traditionally lower relative to other quarters in the year. ###. Q1 Results - Group Highlights. * Cement volumes improved 11 in the first quarter, with continuing strength in emerging markets and solid growth in most of the European countries. As expected, adverse exchange rates continued to weigh on sales and EBITDA, with a negative impact of respectively -8 and -10 (€-195 million on sales and €-29 million on EBITDA). * Like for like, EBITDA increased 21 and EBITDA margin was up 130 basis points, with a particularly good performance in Middle East Africa. The solid operational trend overall reflects volume growth combined with the impact of our actions to reduce costs and promote innovation. Our prices continued to increase in response to the inflation on costs. * Cost reduction and innovation measures generated respectively €80 million (1) and €45million (1) in the quarter, on track to deliver more than €600 million in 2014. * Net income in the first quarter 2013 was impacted by €45 million one-time gains on divestments. Excluding this impact, first quarter 2014 net income is improving by c.€30 million, underpinned by the improvement in current operating income. * Net debt at the end of March decreased €1.3 billion compared to Q1 last year, reflecting higher cash flows and the deleveraging actions taken by the Group. Free cash flows improved by 54 , reflecting our efforts to reduce costs and optimize our working capital and our capital expenditures. (1) Total EBITDA figures before application of IFRS 11 on joint-ventures. After application of IFRS 11, these measures generated €110 million (€70 million for cost savings and €40 million for innovation) at EBITDA level. ###. Bruno Lafont, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lafarge, said:. \"Our first quarter results confirmed the positive trends experienced at the end of last year. Our volumes were supported by continuing growth in emerging markets and the progressive improvement in several European markets. North America was affected by a harsh winter but the underlying market trends are positive. Our outlook for the year is confirmed and we expect to see cement demand growth in our markets of between 2 to 5 percent in 2014. We remain fully focused on achieving our objectives. We will generate more than €600 million additional earnings through cost savings and innovation and aim at bringing our net debt below €9 billion by the end of the year, applying the utmost capital allocation discipline. Thanks to our actions, the group is ideally positioned to take the next step of its development with our project to create LafargeHolcim, the most advanced group in building materials through a merger of equals. This project will sustainably generate superior value and new opportunities for our customers, our employees, local communities and our shareholders.\" ###. Outlook. Overall the Group continues to see cement demand increasing for the full year and estimates market growth of between 2 to 5 percent in 2014 versus 2013. Emerging markets continue to be the main driver of demand and Lafarge will benefit from its well-balanced geographic spread of high quality assets. Cost inflation should continue at a similar pace as in 2013, which should result in higher prices overall. As announced in 2013, the Group targets to reduce net debt to below €9 billion in 2014*. * This objective, announced in 2013, was based on figures as reported, i.e. before the impact of the application of IFRS 11 on joint-ventures. ###. Consolidated Accounts as at March 31, 2014. The Board of Directors of Lafarge, chaired by Bruno Lafont, met on May 5, 2014 and approved the accounts for the period ended March 31, 2014. Further to their limited review of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Lafarge, the auditors have established a report which is included in the interim financial report.

(3) Figures have been restated further to the application of IFRS11 on joint-ventures. ###. Sales Development and Financial Results. Cement volumes increased 11 at constant scope in the quarter, notably supported by our innovation actions, solid trends in Middle East Africa, improved conditions in most European countries and the startup of our new plant in Rajasthan. Q1 is traditionally a lower quarter in our business due to the seasonality effect in the northern hemisphere. Weather conditions were contrasted across the countries where we operate with mild weather conditions in most central and eastern European countries but a particularly harsh winter in North America and in Russia and heavy rains in a few other regions, like the western part of France or South Africa. It is worth noting that in North America, the underlying market trends are solid. Our aggregates and ready-mix volumes were respectively up 4 and down 1 in the quarter. These product lines have a larger exposure to North America and have consequently been more affected by the prevailing weather conditions in this region. Consolidated sales were up 9 at constant scope and exchange rates, with the combination of higher volumes and increased prices across all of our product lines to address cost inflation. As expected, exchange rates impacted negatively our sales by -8 in the first quarter (€-195 million), reflecting the appreciation of the Euro against several emerging currencies starting second half of 2013. Q1 EBITDA was also impacted by exchange rates (-10 , or €-29 million) and compares to a Q1 2013 EBITDA that included a one-time gain (€20 million gain linked to management's decision to review pension commitments in North America). On a like for like basis, EBITDA increased 21 , reflecting the solid volume trends and the result of our cost saving and innovation actions and despite a negative €34 million impact of destocking as we continue to optimize our level of inventories. Cement prices were up 2 compared to Q1 2013 and increased 1.5 compared to Q4 2013, in response to cost inflation. Net loss Group Share in the quarter, at €-135 million, reflects the seasonality of our volumes. Net debt declined by €1.3 billion relative to Q1 last year. It moved slightly higher compared to year-end 2013 due to normal seasonal working capital needs which was though limited thanks to our actions to optimize our inventories level and to the proceeds from divestments received in Q1. ###. Divestments and Investments. Lafarge received €348 million in cash for divestments in the quarter, including the 20 remaining stake in the Gypsum partnership with Etex and Maryland aggregates assets (US). Investments totaled €238 million for the quarter. * Sustaining capital expenditures remained almost stable at €54 million. * Development investments amounted to €184 million in the first quarter of 2014. It mainly included the finalization of our plant in Kaluga (Russia) which produced its first cement in April and investments in our projects in North America (Exshaw - Canada and Ravena - United States) as well as a range of debottlenecking projects. Going forward, we plan to continue to selectively invest in our core geographies, notably in sub-Saharan Africa, where we have announced a plan to increase our capacity in the region by 10 million tonnes over 4 years. ###. Merger of Equals to Create LafargeHolcim. On April 7, 2014, Lafarge and Holcim announced their project to combine the two companies through a merger of equals, unanimously approved by their respective Boards of Directors and fully supported by the core shareholders of both companies. Update on the process will be provided as and when relevant. ###. Impact of IFRS 11. In compliance with the IFRS accounting standards, the Group has applied the new standard IFRS 11 from January 1st, 2014. IFRS requires restating the comparable period of 2013 to have comparable information from one year to the other. The main impact resulting from the application of IFRS 11 is that joint ventures held by the Group that were previously consolidated using proportionate consolidation method, are now accounted for under the equity method. It results in a reclassification from their contribution on a separate line in the profit and loss statement and the balance sheet with no impact on Net income - Group share and Equity - Group share. You will find hereafter the Group's key figures as (i) now published in accordance with IFRS 11 and (ii) pro-forma as if we have continued to apply the previous standard.

{"id":7479,"text":"* Company on track to achieve sustainability targets. * Leader in the industry with lowest CO2 intensity per ton of cement. * Continued strong commitment to sustainability. * Holcim Sustainable Development Ambition 2030 outlined. Holcim today released its 2013 Corporate Sustainability Report detailing the Group’s ongoing activities in sustainable development and disclosing data on a number of key sustainability performance indicators. A panel of independent external experts has contributed to the report by reviewing and confirming the sustainability topics covered. These experts have furthermore made recommendations to Holcim which are included in the report. CEO Bernard Fontana comments: \"Reflecting our vision to provide foundations for society’s future sustainable environmental performance and corporate responsibility are firm parts of Holcim’s business strategy. This mindset has also been part of the foundation of our Holcim Leadership Journey and the performance indicators we release with the report today confirm that we are making further progress in reaching our sustainability targets.\" Occupational Health and Safety is the number one priority for Holcim and key to ensuring continued business success. In 2013, Holcim achieved a Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate for direct employees of 1.3. Holcim will continue to work hard pursuing the \"Zero Harm to People\" objective of the Group. A specific example on how Holcim is doing this is included in the report. Further reduction of CO2 emissions. The production of cement – and in particular clinker – leads to the emission of large amounts of CO2 and subsequently reducing the carbon emissions of its operations remain a key focus of the company’s strategy. Holcim is on track to achieve its target to reduce CO2 emissions per ton of cement by 25 percent by 2015, compared to 1990 and by the end of 2013 had achieved a reduction of 24.3 percent. With net emissions of 572kg of CO2 per ton of cement, Holcim remains the leader in the industry with the lowest CO2 intensity. In 2013, Holcim had an average of 69.8 percent clinker in its cement – also among the lowest in the industry. Holcim also made progress in a number of other fields. The Group has significantly strengthened its compliance activities by enlarging and further defining the compliance function. There has been progress with the implementation of the Holcim Human Rights Management System, and six human rights impact assessments have been carried out and follow up actions identified and instituted. Furthermore, a supplier code of conduct, based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact has been published and communicated to all of the Group’s suppliers. Work has also continued with the implementation of the Holcim Water Management System and in 2012, an efficiency target was announced to reduce water consumption per tonne of product by 20 percent by 2020, when compared to 2012. In addition, Holcim overachieved its target that by the end of 2013, 80 percent of \"biodiversity sensitive\" sites would have a Biodiversity Action Plan with a 90 percent implementation rate. Refreshed commitment to sustainability. In line with its aim to create value for all stakeholders Holcim has over the years been balancing economic value creation, environmental and social responsibility based on its sustainability strategy. Holcim has renewed this commitment to sustainability by outlining the Group’s long term ambitions and interim targets for sustainable development as part of its Holcim Sustainable Development Ambition 2030 covered in this report. The strategy, which was developed in consultation with a broad range of stakeholders and sustainability experts, reflects Holcim’s aspiration to go beyond \"business as usual\" and to be part of the solution to the challenges of our time. The strategy focusses on activities in the areas of Climate, Resources and Communities with an intention to significantly increase the Group’s portfolio of sustainability enhancing products and services. By 2030, Holcim aspires to maintain net CO2 emissions at 2013 levels, across the whole life cycle of its products by compensating or offsetting any increases in emissions from its operations through products and services that reduce emissions from buildings and infrastructure. The Group further aspires to show a positive impact on water resources in water scarce areas and demonstrate a positive change for biodiversity. By focussing on inclusive business solutions and strategic social investments Holcim aspires, by 2030, to have improved the quality of life of 100 million people at the base of the pyramid. The 2013 Corporate Sustainability Report report was assured by PricewaterhouseCoopers and is in accordance with the GRI G4 reporting framework at a comprehensive level. * * * * * * *.

{"id":7532,"text":"Paris, May 4, 2015 – Lafarge has published its fifteenth annual sustainability report, highlighting the acceleration it is making in the field of sustainable development, particularly in tackling the challenges of climate change. The report covers Lafarge’s social, economic and environmental performance for 2014, including an update on progress towards the company’s Sustainability Ambitions 2020 program. There is also a specific focus on the company’s approach to climate change and energy, recognizing the importance of this issue to the business and in preparing for December’s COP21 meeting in Paris, which will bring together governments from around the world to agree upon solutions to combat global warming. This focus demonstrates how Lafarge is transforming its approach to tackle the challenges of climate change. This transformation includes developing new solutions that improve the energy efficiency of buildings, to enable more durable cities to be built, and innovating new lower-carbon products as well as deploying actions to reduce its own footprint and promoting responsible energy and climate change policies. The report also addresses a number of other ‘material issues’ for the business, identified by the Lafarge Sustainability Compass. The Compass is a unique methodology developed by Lafarge and Accenture for ensuring sustainable development actions are fully integrated within the business, taking into account the priorities of stakeholders as well as those of the company. Lafarge’s Chairman and CEO Bruno Lafont said:. \"This report captures the acceleration Lafarge is making across the board, thanks to its comprehensive sustainable development program. This is particularly true for climate change, where the entire life cycle of our materials, from production to their use, is taken into account in our actions. We are working on solutions that both reduce the impact of our industrial sites and meet societal challenges, such as building better cities. \"This work cannot be undertaken alone. We are working with other members of the construction value chain, particularly in reducing the environmental footprint of buildings, which account for around one-third of worldwide carbon emissions. In meeting these challenges and leading the way for the rest of our sector, we are making significant progress towards our stated ambition to make a net positive contribution to society and nature.\" The 2014 Sustainability Report follows GRI G4 best-in-class reporting standards and was audited by Bureau Veritas. As has been the case since the first report, 15 years ago, Lafarge’s performance and report is assessed by a panel of external experts, with their assessment included in the report.

Eric Olsen, CEO of LafargeHolcim said: \"With these results, we are demonstrating that our focus on pricing, synergies and cash flow is delivering results. Our earnings momentum is accelerating and we are on track to achieve our commitments for 2016, resulting in a year of solid progress towards our 2018 objectives. \"These results demonstrate the strength of our balanced portfolio with solid contributions from both mature and emerging countries across our regions. As we anticipated, challenging conditions in Nigeria continued to impact our earnings, but we started to see the positive effects of higher prices and of our actions to diversify our fuel mix towards the end of the quarter. \"Beyond the benefits from the divestment program, we continue to focus on reducing net debt and driving strong cash flow generation.\" 2016 Outlook. 2016 will be a year of progress towards our 2018 targets. We expect demand in our markets to grow at between 1-3 for the full year. Our pricing recovery actions, commercial excellence initiatives and a continuing focus on growth will demonstrate tangible results in 2016. Based on the trends we see, our full year expectations remain unchanged, except for synergies where we now expect to deliver at least CHF 550 million of incremental synergies in 2016. For 2016 we therefore expect:. * Capex to be below CHF 2 billion. * Incremental synergies of at least CHF 550 million of adjusted operating EBITDA. * Net debt to decrease to around CHF 13 billion at year end, including the effect of our planned divestment program. * CHF 3.5 billion divestment program to be completed. Target extended to CHF 5 billion by end of 2017. * At least a high single digit like-for-like increase in adjusted operating EBITDA. We are committed to maintaining a solid investment grade rating and commensurate to this rating, returning excess cash to shareholders. We confirm our commitment to the 2018 targets announced in November 2015 and will provide an update at our Capital Markets Day presentation in London on 18 November 2016. Group performance. Solid growth in the third quarter came from both emerging and mature markets with several countries delivering increased Adjusted Operating EBITDA. The Philippines, the US, Mexico, Argentina, Egypt and Algeria were among the significant contributors as cost discipline, synergies and widespread implementation of our pricing strategy continued to drive positive results. China showed further signs of the recovery seen in the second quarter while India grew Adjusted Operating EBITDA despite the slowing effect of a longer and more intense monsoon season compared to last year, which bodes well for coming quarters. A few markets continue to be challenging. The economy in Brazil remains difficult for the construction sector while Indonesia and Malaysia were affected by market overcapacity and tough competitive environments. Decisive steps have been taken to reduce costs in Brazil while in Indonesia and Malaysia actions to improve competitiveness and performance are being implemented. Measures to increase fuel flexibility in Nigeria following disruptions to gas supplies in the first half, combined with actions to reduce costs, are beginning to have a beneficial effect. However, Nigeria again had a significant impact on Group earnings in the quarter; excluding Nigeria, growth in Adjusted Operating EBITDA for the Group would have been 15 . Globally, cement sales volumes in Q3 reduced by 4 year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. Notably, this was impacted by short term declines in Nigeria, as a result of gas supply interruptions, and India, affected by the extended monsoon period. Excluding Nigeria and India, volumes were down 2 on the back of lower demand in the US, nonrecurring volume gains in Mexico in the prior year and continuing challenging conditions in Brazil and Indonesia. Cement prices were slightly higher on a sequential basis in the third quarter and were up for Q3 at constant exchange rates compared to the same period last year. Synergies contributed CHF 183 million in Q3. As a result, at the end of the third quarter the 2016 synergies target of CHF 450 million had been achieved. The Group now expects to deliver full year incremental synergies of at least CHF 550 million. Adjusted Operating EBITDA was CHF 1.69 billion for the quarter, a year-on-year improvement of 10.5 on a like-for-like basis. Margins showed the benefits of synergies, reduced costs and increased prices; Adjusted Operating EBITDA margin rose to 23.9 in Q3, a 290 basis points increase on the figure for the prior year period. On a like-for-like basis, Operating Free Cash Flow improved by CHF 1 billion year-on-year. It stands at CHF 317 million after nine months, impacted by the traditional seasonality of our working capital. The closing of divestments in Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia and the deconsolidation of Morocco and Ivory Coast contributed CHF 795 million in cash proceeds in Q3. Net debt stood at CHF 16.5 billion, down from CHF 17.3 billion at the end of the fourth quarter 2015. Group – Pro Forma information Q3 2016 Q3 2015 ± ± like-for-like.

Regional Performance Highlights. Asia Pacific. LafargeHolcim’s Asia Pacific region delivered a solid improvement in margins in Q3 and a 6.7 growth in Adjusted Operating EBITDA on a like-for-like basis. Volumes increased in a number of markets including the Philippines, China and Vietnam. China, which delivered improved Adjusted Operating EBITDA growth, continued to benefit from our segmented market strategy in key regions. Costs were also lower as the business benefited from favorable energy price trends, optimizing raw material consumption and more effective procurement management. In the Philippines, like-for-like Adjusted Operating EBITDA growth was supported by cost discipline and improved pricing in a market that is enjoying healthy demand in housing and infrastructure. India continued the turnaround in business performance, though a more intense and extended monsoon season, which is positive for demand going forward, had a softening effect on volumes in Q3. More widely, good cost performance, combined with our focus on price and margin improvement had a positive effect on like-for-like Adjusted Operating EBITDA growth. Australia saw lower aggregate volumes and reduced Adjusted Operating EBITDA following the completion earlier this year of the construction phase of the Gorgon gas project in Western Australia. Indonesia and Malaysia were affected by overcapacity and a difficult competitive environment. LafargeHolcim is taking specific measures in both countries to improve competitiveness and performance in light of challenging market conditions.

Europe. Disciplined cost management and continued delivery of synergies helped drive strong margin improvement and a 16.3 rise in Adjusted Operating EBITDA on a like-for-like basis despite a slight fall in net sales. Most countries reported resilient performance with the positive effects of favorable weather in September visible in improved overall cement and aggregate volumes. France experienced flat volumes in what remains a stable market. The UK contributed to growth in Adjusted Operating EBITDA helped by disciplined cost management. Russia, which has suffered from low oil and gas prices, showed some signs of stabilisation in the quarter with a better than expected upturn in activity and pricing during the important summer construction period. Belgium returned solid Adjusted Operating EBITDA on the back of a positive product mix effect in aggregates. Switzerland delivered an increase in Adjusted Operating EBITDA through decisive cost reduction actions while growing volumes. Romania and Poland experienced tougher conditions in Q3, negatively affecting year-on-year growth in earnings. Both countries were impacted by delayed infrastructure projects financed from European Union funds. Spain showed little sign of improvement in Q3 as political uncertainty continued to depress levels of investment and the overall economy.

Latin America. Adjusted Operating EBITDA in the Latin America region benefited from continued margin expansion, which grew by 420 basis points in the quarter despite the significant slowdown experienced in Brazil. Adjusted Operating EBITDA improved 7.5 on a like-for-like basis in Q3 with pricing and cost measures more than offsetting reduced volumes. Mexico again saw robust improvement in earnings, boosted by the effect of the rollout of a segmented customer strategy and favorable pricing. Consolidation of offices is also helping to reduce costs. Volumes were lower than in Q3 2015, in part due to nonrecurring gains in the prior year. Argentina, El Salvador and Ecuador also made positive contributions to year-on-year Adjusted Operating EBITDA growth. Performance in Argentina was helped by reduced industrial costs, the delivery of synergies and price increases. In Ecuador, which continues to see the impact of low oil prices and the after effects of April’s earthquake, the company continued to reduce costs and benefited from higher volumes for readymix concrete products, driven by new metro and tramway infrastructure projects. Colombia was negatively impacted in Q3 by a national transport strike that disrupted logistics across the industry for several weeks. Costa Rica was adversely affected by increased foreign imports. Brazil again had a negative impact on the region with challenging conditions depressing economic activity across the country. As in previous quarters, reduced volumes and downward pricing pressure contributed to a decline in Q3 Adjusted Operating EBITDA. This impact was partly mitigated by decisive cost reduction actions.

Middle East Africa. During Q3, Adjusted Operating EBITDA in the Middle East Africa region continued to be negatively impacted by challenging conditions in Nigeria. Adjusted Operating EBITDA on a like-for-like basis was down 5.1 on slightly increased net sales. For the region, Adjusted Operating EBITDA would have been up by 28 on a like-for-like basis in Q3 without the effect of Nigeria. Countries across the Middle East, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa made positive earnings contributions with Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon and Uganda all adding to Adjusted Operating EBITDA growth. Algeria saw volumes hold up well through the Eid festival period with social housing and infrastructure projects continuing to be drivers of demand. Earnings in Egypt were buoyed by a supportive market, good contracts and the effective implementation of the company’s pricing strategy. In Iraq, more favorable market conditions helped to drive improved performance compared to last year. For a second quarter, Nigeria had a negative impact on Adjusted Operating EBITDA. Conditions continue to be difficult though pricing has improved, especially during September. Measures to increase fuel flexibility following gas supply interruptions earlier in the year enabled production levels to recover at the end of the quarter. Plans are now in place to address logistical problems with the objective to ensure full supply levels to customers. Middle East Africa – Pro Forma information Q3 2016 Q3 2015 ± ± like-for-like.

North America. In the third quarter, the North America region delivered a 450 basis point improvement in margins (Adjusted Operating EBITDA margin) through successful implementation of pricing strategy, synergies and cost reduction measures. Adjusted Operating EBITDA on a like-for-like basis for Q3 was up 9.2 despite softened demand. The US reported a strong performance despite lower cement volumes impacted by delays to infrastructure projects and the effect of unfavorable weather conditions for construction. Ongoing cost measures had a positive effect on margins and Adjusted Operating EBITDA. In addition to the beneficial impact of lower energy prices, which persisted into the quarter, the US succeeded in accelerating the capture of synergies and cost savings in areas such as distribution and plant networks. Adjusted Operating EBITDA on a like-for-like basis was down for both Eastern and Western Canada in the quarter. Western Canada continued to be negatively affected by lower investment activity as a result of the ongoing oil price-driven economic downturn in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Divestments and capital allocation. Net of tax, the proceeds of the deals announced since the beginning of the year will result in a total net debt reduction of around CHF 3.5 billion expected in 2016. These proceeds, which we expect to have received by the end of the year, will contribute to the achievement of our target to reduce net debt to around CHF 13 billion by the end of 2016. Following the extension of the program to CHF 5 billion, we expect to complete the remainder by the end of 2017. With divestments closing and our cash generation from synergies and reduced capex gaining momentum, our credit ratios will significantly strengthen, consistent with our commitment to maintain a solid investment grade rating throughout the cycle. We will return excess cash to shareholders through share buybacks or special dividends commensurate with a solid investment grade credit rating. Capital expenditure for Q3 was CHF 399 million of which CHF 110 million was expansion capex. This year, we are commissioning or upgrading capacity in some of our key markets such as Algeria, the US, Nigeria and India and we expect to see further benefits of this expansion as production ramps up. Cash flow & net financial debt. Operating free cash flow year-to-date improved by CHF 1.0 billion compared with nine months 2015 benefiting from a tight control of Capex and working capital, lower financial expenses paid and income tax paid. Change in working capital in the nine months resulted in a cash outflow mainly due to the seasonality in the northern hemisphere. Net debt stands at CHF 16.5 billion (CHF 17.3 billion in Q4 2015). This reflects the deconsolidation of Morocco and Ivory Coast in Q3, the divestments in Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia in Q3 and the divestment of South Korea in Q2 for a total amount of CHF 1.4 billion as well as the improvement in the operating free cash flow benefiting from Capex maintained at CHF 1.2 billion. The dividend of CHF 909 million was paid out in May. As a result of our liability management transactions and refinancing activities in the first three quarters of 2016, the average debt maturity has increased from 4.2 years at the end of 2015 to 5.6 years at the end of Q3 2016. Finance synergies are well on track and supported a reduction in the cost of debt from 5.4 post-merger to 4.8 at the end of the quarter. Merger, restructuring and other one-offs. Total one-off costs amounted to CHF 267 million for the nine months 2016 and included CHF 174 million of implementation costs related to synergies. Financial expenses. Net financial expenses of CHF 607 million are CHF 383 million below the pro forma nine months 2015 results reflecting synergy benefits arising from the merger and lower levels of net financial debt in 2016. The reduction of net financial expenses has been achieved despite CHF 90 million one-off premiums recorded on liability management operations, of which CHF 22 million occurred in Q3. Tax. Tax for the nine months 2016 is mainly impacted by the non-recognition of tax losses notably in Brazil and Nigeria partially offset by the tax effect of the divestments. Our underlying normative tax rate stands at around 29 . Net income. Net income Group share of CHF 1.34 billion is up CHF 704 million compared with pro forma nine months 2015 results. The improvement in net income includes a contribution from lower merger and restructuring costs and gains on disposals, partly offset by the impact in 2015 of the one-off re-evaluation gains on the previously held equity interest of Lafarge Cement Egypt and of Unicem Nigeria. Viewed on a recurring basis, net income Group share for the first nine months was CHF 1.18 billion, up CHF 627 million compared with pro forma nine months 2015. In the third quarter, recurring net income Group share was CHF 680 million, up CHF 387 million on the prior year period.

For the purpose of the proposed merger, the 2014 pro forma information that was included in the Registration Document registered on May 11, 2015 reflected only the effect of the merger Lafarge\/Holcim and its direct consequences (notably the divestments to CRH) as known at that time. Now with the merger completed, the pro forma financial information included in this report’s Shareholders’ Letter, in addition to the merger and the latest changes in the scope of the divestments achieved in the context of the merger Lafarge\/Holcim, also reflects the impact of the reclassification of merger related and restructuring costs, the deconsolidation of the Australian business operated under a joint-venture and the effect of the divestments achieved over the course of 2014 and 2015 initiated or completed by Lafarge. These figures do not take into consideration any purchase price accounting impact on operating EBITDA which will mainly come from inventory valuation.

{"id":7647,"text":"In the course of 2016, a number of publications reported allegations involving legacy Lafarge operations at its plant in Syria, specifically that company personnel had engaged in dealings with certain armed groups and with sanctioned parties during 2013 until the plant was ultimately evacuated in September 2014. As previously communicated, in response to these allegations, the company commenced an internal independent investigation under the supervision of the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board. The findings of the investigation illustrate that the deterioration of the political situation in Syria posed very difficult challenges for the security and operations of the plant and its employees. Such challenges included threats to the safety of its employees as well as disruption of supplies needed to operate the plant and product distribution. At times, different armed factions controlled or sought to control the areas around the plant. It appears from the investigation that the local company provided funds to third parties to work out arrangements with a number of these armed groups, including sanctioned parties, in order to maintain operations and ensure safe passage of employees and supplies to and from the plant. The investigation could not establish with certainty the ultimate recipients of funds beyond those third parties engaged. In hindsight, the measures required to continue operations at the plant were unacceptable. Those responsible for the Syria operations appear to have acted in a manner they believed was in the best interests of the company and its employees. However, the investigation revealed significant errors in judgment that are inconsistent with the applicable code of conduct. The legacy Lafarge operations in Syria operated at a loss during the time period in question and represented less than 1 of the Group’s sales at the time. As a consequence of the internal review and its findings, the Board has taken a number of decisions. First of all, the Board approved the creation of a new Ethics, Integrity & Risk committee, supervised by a member of the Executive Committee. The decisions further include, with the assistance of outside counsel, continuing improvements of efforts already undertaken by the Group in the last few years, specifically the adoption of a more rigorous risk assessment process focusing in particular on high risk third parties and joint venture partners, a restricted party screening program, a new sanctions and export control program and further efforts resulting from a benchmarking exercise it has undertaken. The Board has instructed executive management to vigorously implement these actions, which are designed to further strengthen and resource a state-of-the-art compliance organization and processes reflecting best practices. It makes it clear that there can be no compromise with compliance nor with adherence to the standards reflected in the company's code of conduct no matter the operational challenges. Based on the information available today, there is no indication that the reported allegations are likely to have an adverse financial impact that is material to the Group. In connection with the reported activities, criminal complaints are reported to have been filed in France. Such proceedings are conducted under a rule of secrecy and neither Lafarge SA nor any of its affiliates have been made a party to any of them. In light of the proceedings, the company will not comment further on the findings or individual conduct. About LafargeHolcim.

With leading positions in all regions, LafargeHolcim employs around 90,000 employees in more than 80 countries and has a portfolio that is equally balanced between developing and mature markets. About LafargeHolcim in Syria. Due to the nature of the product and its manufacture, cement plants are located in or near the markets they serve. In some locations, this presents distinct challenges. Syria is one such place. Lafarge built a cement plant in Syria which required almost 3 years to build at a cost of approximately $680 million. It started production in May, 2010 and was a source of meaningful employment for the surrounding communities, providing cement for homes, businesses, roads and the like for various communities throughout Syria. Almost from its opening, the political situation in Syria was rapidly deteriorating and posed very difficult challenges for the security and operations of the plant and our employees. Such challenges included disruption of supplies needed to operate the plant and product distribution as well as threats to the safety of our employees. At times different armed political factions controlled or sought to control the areas around the plant. Circumstances around the plant became increasingly worse and were ultimately untenable forcing LafargeHolcim to abandon it in September, 2014 and lay off employees who had depended on LafargeHolcim’s employment for their livelihood. The Group has not attempted to operate on site since that time. Important disclaimer - forward-looking statements. This document contains forward-looking statements.

{"id":7653,"text":"LafargeHolcim has played a vital role in the construction of India’s longest highway tunnel located in the country’s northern state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Chenani-Nashri tunnel was inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week and cuts travel time between the two cities of Jammu and Srinagar by two hours while eliminating safety hazards on the existing mountainous route. LafargeHolcim’s Indian company Ambuja Cement developed tailor-made logistics to ensure regular delivery of more than 300,000 tonnes of high-quality cement to the remote mountain area. Ambuja Cement’s technical services teams provided complete technical support for this venture. The teams conducted cement mix design trials to achieve optimized mix proportion. Following the mix design trials, it was observed that Ambuja Cement retained its strength, despite the low temperatures in the region. The company held self-compacting concrete workshops for engineers to upgrade their knowledge and skills and also provided continuous support at the construction site to identify, diagnose and quickly resolve problems. The Group has started providing materials to the project in 2010. LafargeHolcim has been involved in a range of other major infrastructure projects in India including major highway and railroad projects and the Z-Morh and Qazigund-Banihal tunnels that are also located in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Other projects include metro rails in Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, and Hyderabad and several hydro-electric power plants. LafargeHolcim is the leading provider of building materials for tunnel constructions in the world. Last year, LafargeHolcim added a major tunnel construction projects to its portfolio of successful milestone projects: the world's longest railway tunnel, the 57-kilometer Gotthard base tunnel in Switzerland. The Group is also involved in a range of other major tunnel projects in Switzerland and other regions including metro lines in Lyon, Milan and Cairo. About the Chenani-Nashri tunnel. The new 9 km single tube bi-directional Chenani-Nashri tunnel with a parallel intermediate lane escape tunnel of 29 cross passages, is considered one of the most challenging infrastructure projects in India in recent years. It will make road travel safer and reduce traffic disturbances caused by unpredictable land-slides, sharp bends, vehicle breakdowns and accidents on the existing mountainous route.

Our Middle East Africa region performed particularly well with a recovering Nigeria making a notable contribution to earnings growth.\" India showed encouraging signs in the quarter with the impact of demonetization now behind us while our US business was robust despite tough prior year comparisons on the back of mild weather in the first three months of 2016.\" \"Our performance in the first quarter, our continued strong execution combined with our diverse portfolio reinforces our confidence in achieving our full year guidance and our 2018 targets.\" 2017 Outlook. In 2017, we will deliver sustainable, profitable growth through continued strong focus on lower Capex, structural cost savings, synergies and commercial differentiation of our products and building solutions. This will be particularly supported by the contribution of several markets such as the US, India, Nigeria and some countries in Europe while we forecast demand in our markets to increase by between 2 to 4 percent. We expect to deliver strong growth in Operating EBITDA Adjusted and recurring EPS in 2017:. * Double-digit like-for-like growth in Operating EBITDA Adjusted over 2016. * Recurring EPS growth of more than 20 percent. * Targeted net debt to Operating EBITDA Adjusted ratio of around two times. In 2017, the Group will be returning cash to shareholders commensurate with a solid investment grade rating:. * Dividend of CHF 2.0 a share proposed at today’s AGM. * Share buyback program of up to CHF 1 billion over 2017-2018. Group performance. The Group recorded increased like-for-like Operating EBITDA Adjusted in four of our five regions. Europe, Latin America and North America all contributed to increased earnings while margins in Middle East Africa were up strongly year-on-year helped by an effective turnaround in Nigeria and good performance in Algeria. The US reported solid growth despite a tough prior year comparison while Mexico, Argentina and Ecuador performed well. India grew volumes as the effect of demonetization, which is now fully behind us, became steadily less pronounced over the quarter. Persistent challenging conditions in Indonesia and Malaysia, where action plans continue to be implemented, plus a relative softening of the Philippines market, negatively affected prior year comparisons for the Asia Pacific region. After a decline in 2016, global cement volumes were flat on a like-for-like basis for the first quarter supported by a strong month of March. Aggregates volumes increased by 3.9 percent like-for-like, helped by good performances in the US and UK. The improvement in cement pricing seen over the previous year continued in Q1 with a 1.2 percent sequential increase over Q4 2016 and a 5.3 percent improvement on the prior year period, driven largely by positive movements in Middle East Africa and Latin America. Synergies contributed CHF 94 million in the quarter and the Group is on track to achieve the target run rate of CHF 400 million for 2017. Since the merger, nearly CHF 900 million in synergies had been delivered by the end of Q1 2017. Operating EBITDA Adjusted was CHF 801 million, up 14.5 percent on a like-for-like basis. Favorable pricing and cost reduction were reflected in higher margins, up nearly 120 basis points like-for-like in Q1 despite the effect of inflation and increases in energy costs. Both recurring net income and recurring earnings per share increased during the quarter versus prior year. The negative movement in Operating Free Cash Flow – which stood at CHF -836 million – resulted mainly from higher seasonal cash outflow. Net debt stood at CHF 15 billion at quarter end, marginally up on the December 31, 2016 figure and down around CHF 3 billion compared to Q1 2016. This reflects cash receipts from the Vietnam divestment and capex discipline during the period which helped offset the seasonal impact on cash flow. Group Q1 2017 Q1 2016* ±  ± like-for-like.

Regional performance. Asia Pacific. The Asia Pacific region was impacted by challenging market conditions in some key countries, notably Indonesia and Malaysia. This led to a 13.4 percent decrease in Operating EBITDA Adjusted for the region on a like-for-like basis. Cement and ready-mix volumes were flat in the quarter while aggregates increased. Indonesia continues to be affected by additional capacity in an oversupplied market. Weather was also a factor in the quarter, with particularly heavy rains impacting construction. Country teams are focused on cost as well as commercial transformation measures. The Malaysia market suffered from competitive pressures and demand has yet to recover after the significant decline in 2016. Cement volumes were down in the first quarter. A program of commercial and cost measures is being implemented. In the Philippines, which enjoyed a pre-election construction boost in Q1 of 2016, the market slowed in the first quarter ahead of an expected ramp-up in infrastructure investment by the new government. Cost reduction measures are in place to compensate for downsides driven by delays in projects and higher energy costs. The impact of demonetization in India steadily abated during Q1 and the effects are now fully behind the business. A notable improvement in volumes was achieved throughout the quarter leading to a 4 percent increase over the period. Higher volumes and pricing plus tighter cost management partly mitigated the effect of elevated energy and distribution costs. Australia made a strong contribution to Operating EBITDA Adjusted despite adverse weather conditions caused by Cyclone Debbie. Asia Pacific Q1 2017 Q1 2016* ±  ± like-for-like.

Europe. Europe benefited from higher cement and aggregates volumes in the quarter to record an 8.7 percent improvement in Operating EBITDA Adjusted on a like-for-like basis. The solid earnings performance, in what is a small quarter for the region, was particularly noteworthy in light of the cold weather conditions experienced across Europe during the period. Despite ongoing uncertainty related to Brexit, the UK economy remained relatively healthy, with government investment supporting demand in the construction sector during the quarter. Volumes in aggregates and ready-mix were ahead of the prior year. Germany saw volumes of cement and aggregates increase on the back of positive market demand. Earnings were down in France versus the prior year. Although better momentum was seen at the end of the reporting period, results were impacted by harsh weather conditions over the first quarter. Russia made progress compared to the first quarter of 2016, albeit from a low base following an extended period of challenging market conditions. Price movements plus higher cement volumes were key factors in the recovery. In Switzerland, positive cement volumes could not offset lower sales in the aggregates business and a decline in ready-mix volumes following the completion of large projects in 2016. Continuing pressure from imports and cold weather in January and February also contributed to a reduced Operating EBITDA Adjusted for the quarter. Europe Q1 2017 Q1 2016* ±  ± like-for-like.

Latin America. In the Latin America region, a combination of positive pricing trends supported by cost discipline contributed to strong growth in earnings despite an overall decline in cement, aggregates and ready-mix volumes. Operating EBITDA Adjusted was up 17.7 percent on a like-for-like basis compared to the previous year. Argentina, which saw a strengthening economy, benefited from a combination of more favorable pricing, disciplined cost management and improved volumes to deliver a marked improvement in earnings in the quarter. In Ecuador, improved volumes and pricing, combined with cost measures and commercial initiatives, drove increased earnings after challenging conditions in 2016. In Mexico, where earnings saw a marked improvement on a like-for-like basis, lower cement volumes were more than offset by favorable pricing dynamics. Volumes in ready-mix were marginally up in spite of delays in some large infrastructure projects. The Colombian market is characterized by intense competition as well as low levels of investment in construction and infrastructure. This led to a weakening in Operating EBITDA Adjusted for the quarter. Local management is focused on improving profitability, especially in the retail segment. There were modest signs of improvement in parts of the Brazilian economy in the quarter, though the environment for cement, aggregates and ready-mix is widely expected to remain very challenging, at least for the near term.

Middle East Africa. Middle East Africa delivered strong earnings growth in the first quarter. Operating EBITDA Adjusted was 48.5 percent higher than in the prior-year period on a like-for-like basis with improved pricing outweighing lower volumes of cement, aggregates and ready-mix. Performance in Nigeria was particularly strong with earnings significantly ahead of Q1 2016 despite softer market demand nationwide. While currency volatility continues, the business benefited from favorable pricing dynamics over the quarter as well as an improved operational performance. Customer demand was strongest in the residential sector, especially in the south of the country. Algeria delivered volume and price improvements to contribute significantly higher Operating EBITDA Adjusted. This was supported by new capacity at the recently commissioned Biskra cement plant. Egypt showed its resilience in Q1. Despite persistent challenging market conditions following devaluation of the Egyptian pound, earnings contribution grew quarter-on-quarter. Lebanon delivered improved Operating EBITDA Adjusted helped by favorable pricing. South Africa, Uganda and Zambia remain challenging markets affected by overcapacity. Heavy rains also had a negative impact in Q1. Middle East Africa Q1 2017 Q1 2016* ±  ± like-for-like. Sales of cement million t 9.1  10.8  -16.1 -4.1.

North America. North America region recorded an improvement in earnings despite a tough prior year comparison due to unusually mild weather in Q1 2016. In what is a typically small quarter for the region, margins increased by around 60 basis points, net sales grew by 2.5 on a like-for-like basis and Operating EBITDA Adjusted was up slightly to CHF 8 million. The US continued to benefit from improved cement pricing and an ongoing focus on cost discipline. Cement volumes in Q1 were down compared to the previous year when favorable weather conditions across the US drove a 19 percent increase. Strong demand across all product lines led to good growth in US aggregates volumes and a positive contribution to EBITDA. In Canada, performance was stable despite the ongoing impact of low oil prices on the economy in the west of the country, especially in Alberta and Saskatchewan. In Eastern Canada, the timing of projects such as the Champlain Bridge project had a positive effect on aggregates and ready-mix. Across Canada improved pricing contributed to earnings while volumes were down, affected by weather in West Canada. Operating EBITDA Adjusted declined for Canada.

Merger, restructuring and other one-offs. Total one-off costs amounted to CHF 96 million for Q1 2017. Of that, CHF 31 million were implementation costs related to synergies. A total of CHF 44 million of non-merger-related restructuring provisions were recorded as we implement our plan to reduce SG&A expenses to below 7 percent of sales by 2018. Share of profits from Joint Ventures. From January 1, 2017, management decided to include the Group’s share of profit of joint ventures within operating profit as such a presentation will provide more relevant information regarding the Group’s financial performance, considering that the underlying operational activities of joint ventures are jointly controlled and reflect the core business activities of LafargeHolcim. Q1 2016 figures were restated accordingly and increased the operating profit by CHF 16 million. Excluding the effect of joint ventures, Operating EBITDA Adjusted on a like-for-like basis increased by 14 percent. The share of profits from joint ventures increased from CHF 16 million to CHF 29 million, reflecting the contribution of a larger scope in Morocco further to the deal closed in Q3 2016 where Holcim Morocco (fully consolidated) was merged into the Lafarge Morocco Joint Venture: Morocco and the cement operations in Australia all delivered a positive contribution to this increase. Share of profits from associates. The share of profits from associates increased from CHF 4 million to CHF 12 million, reflecting the higher contribution of Huaxin Cement, China further to the streamlined operations in China where part of the legacy Lafarge operations was sold to Huaxin. Financial expenses. Net financial expenses of CHF 172 million are CHF 53 million below Q1 2016 results reflecting favorable positive impact of our cash position denominated in foreign currencies and synergy benefits arising from the merger as well as lower levels of net financial debt in 2017. Tax. The effective tax rate for Q1 2017 is 23.2 percent deriving from a yearly projected tax rate of around 28 percent and the impact of the divestment of Vietnam in Q1 2017. Net income. Net income Group share of CHF 226 million compares with a loss of CHF 107 million for Q1 2016. The improvement in net income includes the profit recognized on the disposal of Vietnam in Q1 2017 of CHF 339 million. Viewed on a recurring basis, net loss group share for Q1 2017 was CHF -19 million, an improvement of CHF 61 million compared with CHF -80 million in Q1 2016. Divestments and capital allocation. Net of tax, the proceeds of the deals completed during Q1 2017 resulted in a net debt reduction of around CHF 0.6 billion following notably the completion of the Vietnam divestment. An additional CHF 0.5 billion from announced deals in China is expected in 2017. The balance will be received when local restrictions in China are lifted. We expect to complete the remainder of the CHF 5 billion divestment program by the end of 2017. Net capital expenditure for Q1 was CHF 318 million of which CHF 84 million was expansion Capex. In 2017, we are commissioning or upgrading capacity in some of our key markets such as Algeria, the US, Nigeria and India and we expect to see further benefits of this expansion as production ramps up. With divestments closing and our cash generation from synergies and reduced capex gaining momentum, our credit ratios will significantly strengthen, consistent with our commitment to maintain a solid investment grade rating throughout the cycle. We will continue to return excess cash to shareholders through share buybacks or special dividends commensurate with a solid investment grade credit rating. Cash flow & net financial debt. Operating free cash flow for 2017 was negatively impacted in 2017 by higher cash outflow due to the working capital seasonality in the northern hemisphere. Net debt stands at CHF 15.0 billion (CHF 14.7 billion as per December 31, 2016) in line with Q1 2017 management expectations.

{"id":7687,"text":"LafargeHolcim together with its partner Heliatek have developed a unique photovoltaic energy-generating concrete facade that has the capability to double the energy generation traditionally achieved by roof-based solar systems. LafargeHolcim and Heliatek have closely collaborated over the last two years to create a cladding solution combining Ductal® and HeliaFilm®, Heliatek’s flexible and ultra-light solar film. With this new solution, prefabricated Ductal panels are delivered on site with an integrated solar energy-generation system. This cladding boosts the building’s ability to generate energy independently and offers a reliable, decentralized and decarbonized energy supply. A 10 storey commercial building covered with 60 percent of its facade with the Ductal\/HeliaFilm cladding system could generate approximately 30 percent of its annual energy requirement. Gérard Kuperfarb, Group Head of Growth & Innovation at LafargeHolcim said: \"LafargeHolcim seeks to offer sustainable, high-performance construction solutions that improve energy efficiency for buildings. With this Ductal\/ HeliaFilm solution, building owners and developers as well as architects and engineers will be able to mitigate the energy costs of a building while enjoying the many benefits of a very light, low maintenance and long-lasting cladding solution.\" LafargeHolcim’s Research & Development focuses on addressing today’s major construction challenges. 30 to 40 percent of global energy consumption is used for heating and cooling buildings and insulation regulations are being strengthened all over the world. Decentralized energy generation in buildings is among the critical levers to mitigate the impact of buildings on climate change but also to reduce the operating expenses for owners and optimize the use of national power grids. Heliatek, a technology leader in the field of organic electronics, has developed a range of ultra-light (1 kg\/sqm), highly aesthetic, thin, solar films. With a CO2 life cycle impact close to five times less than traditional crystalline photovoltaics, the HeliaFilm is the greenest photovoltaics solution worldwide. \"Cooperation like the one we have with LafargeHolcim is at the core of our strategy. Our HeliaFilm is the active element which transforms building cladding into a power station. This is the path to green, localized electricity.\" stated Thibaud Le Séguillon, CEO of Heliatek GmbH. A prototype of this new photovoltaic facade system will be presented at Batimat, the French construction fair in November, and a pilot project is planned in 2018. ### About LafargeHolcim.

{"id":7749,"text":"LafargeHolcim will play a key role in building Egypt’s new capital, currently under construction 45 kilometers outside of Cairo. The city will become the country’s new administrative and financial capital, with around 5 million inhabitants. Since the beginning of the construction works LafargeHolcim has supported several of its landmark projects, with a total contract value for LafargeHolcim of around CHF 50 million. Among the buildings using LafargeHolcim’s innovative, high-performance materials is the so-called Iconic Tower, which is set to become the highest tower in Africa with a height of 385 meters when completed by the end of 2020. Miljan Gutovic, Region Head Middle East Africa, said: \"We are delighted to contribute to Egypt’s new state-of-the-art capital. With these important project wins we continue LafargeHolcim’s successful history of supporting large-scale construction projects across Egypt. These projects improve millions of lives by providing better infrastructure and housing. We are confident that we will be able to provide further value-adding solutions for other landmark projects in the country.\" ##. Innovative and high-performance materials. LafargeHolcim is providing a range of specialty high-quality solutions for several landmark buildings. For the Iconic Tower, LafargeHolcim is using an innovative and sustainable cement solution with higher slag contents to meet the contractor’s specifications. The solution is unique to the Egyptian market and provides an extended lifetime of more than 100 years thanks to its higher durability and strength, which are essential for a structure of this size and weight. LafargeHolcim was the exclusive cement supplier for the tower’s base construction work, and in February this year poured concrete nonstop for 48 hours, the country’s longest-ever concrete pour. Thanks to its production and logistics capabilities the company could supply large quantities of cement in a short time, significantly cutting the time needed for the pour. LafargeHolcim is also providing lightweight concrete solutions for the Egyptian Cabinet building, which will be part of the government district of the new city and will include the parliament, ministries and other state institutions. These lightweight solutions deliver adequate strength and density values and minimize dead loads on the building. LafargeHolcim is the only building materials company in Egypt that offers this type of solution. Additionally the company is supplying further solutions for several other ministry buildings. To ensure materials are delivered reliably and on-time, a new concrete batching plant has been installed on-site. Another one with an expected production capacity of 300,000 cubic meters is scheduled to open by the end of Q1. The company is also taking the lead in quality control with its state-of-the-art local laboratory, where it can test both its own solutions as well as construction materials provided by other suppliers. LafargeHolcim is engaged in several other landmark projects in Egypt that support the country’s growth agenda, including two new metro lines in Cairo, the new Suez Canal tunnels and several port extensions.

{"id":7768,"text":"LafargeHolcim is increasing its efforts to further improve the carbon-efficiency of its cements with the launch of the CO₂MENT project in Canada. The objective is to build the world’s first full-cycle solution to capture and reuse CO2 from a cement plant while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The project is a partnership between Lafarge Canada, Inventys and Total. Over the next four years, Project CO₂MENT will demonstrate and evaluate Inventys’ CO₂ Capture System and a selection of LafargeHolcim’s carbon utilization technologies at its Richmond, British Columbia, Canada cement plant. The project has three phases and is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2020. Subject to the pilot’s success, the vision is to scale up the project and explore how the facility can be replicated across other LafargeHolcim plants. During the first phase the partners will work on purifying the cement flue gas in preparation for CO2 capture. The second phase will focus on the separation of CO2 from flue gas using a customized for cement version of Inventys’ carbon capture technology at pilot scale. As part of the final phase, the captured CO2 will be prepared for reuse and support the economical assessment and demonstration of CO2 conversion technologies onsite, such as CO2 injected concrete and fly ash. Apart from increasing its focus on new innovative breakthrough solutions such as the CO₂MENT project, LafargeHolcim is also further investing into measures to reduce the clinker-to-cement ratio and consume less energy per tonne of cement by using lower carbon fuels and improving the efficiency of the company’s processes. At its Richmond plant, the company recently launched a new and improved lower carbon fuel (LCF) system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of cement. It will also help minimize landfill waste; specifically, non-recyclable plastics that are creating a backlog for municipalities across Canada. The CAD 28 million system is expected to replace up to 50 per cent of fossil fuel use with lower carbon fuels and could result in a 20 per cent reduction of combustion emissions. It also allows Lafarge Canada to divert approximately 100,000 tonnes per year of waste from local landfills, the equivalent of about 8,300 loaded garbage trucks. René Thibault, Region Head North America: \"LafargeHolcim is committed to reducing CO2 emissions and we are excited to join forces with Inventys and Total through Project CO₂MENT. We hope to discover ways to capture emissions from our production processes and reuse them in our products, advancing a circular economy even further than today. The recent launch of the new LCF system at our Richmond plant aims to make the facility the most carbon efficient cement plant in Canada. Our investment alongside funding support from the British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy has made the system economically viable and demonstrates a long term commitment to the environment as well as the British Columbia cement market.\" LafargeHolcim cement is already among the most carbon efficient in the world. Since 1990, the company has reduced its net carbon emissions per tonne of cement by 25 percent, making LafargeHolcim the leader of international cement companies, with the highest reduction compared to the 1990 baseline. Canada will be pushing to reduce its carbon footprint even further through expanded lower carbon fuels, growth in supplementary cementitious materials and energy efficiency initiatives.

{"id":7770,"text":"LafargeHolcim allocates CHF 160 million to reduce carbon footprint in Europe LafargeHolcim is increasing its efforts to further improve the carbon-efficiency of its products and solutions. The objective is to reduce annual CO2 emissions in Europe by a further 15 percent like-for-like, representing 3 million tons1, by 2022. This will be achieved with an investment of CHF 160 million into advanced equipment as well as technologies to increase the use of low-carbon fuels and recycled materials in the company’s processes and products. Further funds are earmarked for the introduction of new carbon-efficient materials and services. Over the next three years, LafargeHolcim will work on more than 80 projects across 19 European countries. Marcel Cobuz, Region Head Europe: \"We are cognizant of our impact on the environment and will remain at the forefront of efforts to mitigate climate change. With this investment in Europe, we are taking a further step to become more carbon-efficient. We are not only investing to reduce CO2 in our own operations, but are also seeking the collaboration with our customers across the value-chain to improve the carbon efficiency of buildings and infrastructure throughout their lifecycle.\" One of the key levers to improve carbon-efficiency is to integrate the principle of circular economy into the cement production process by using waste materials instead of fossil fuels and primary raw materials. In 2018, LafargeHolcim repurposed 11 million tons of waste materials including 2 million tons of non-recyclable plastics that would otherwise end up in e.g. landfills creating further CO2 emissions. By stepping up its efforts in Europe the company aims at repurposing an additional 1.5 million tons of waste which would lead to avoiding 1 million tons of CO2 per year. As part of the roadmap, LafargeHolcim will also increase the use of mineral alternatives and waste materials. On average, LafargeHolcim already uses 4.5 million tons to replace clinker with by-products from other industries. It is during the production of clinker, the main component of cement, when most CO2 emissions associated with cement occur. Additional efforts to replace clinker will allow the company to increase the CO2 efficiency of its cements produced in Europe by 1 million tons. Portfolio of low-carbon solutions to be expanded across Europe. In all countries, LafargeHolcim is working on products and services to help its customers improve the carbon efficiency of buildings and infrastructure across their lifecycle. In France, for example, the company has recently launched Lafarge360, a new integrated offer that includes scoring and carbon footprint modelling enabling customers to make informed decisions around the environmental impact of their project. Furthermore, low-carbon products are designed in France, Poland and Romania for soil stabilizations ensuring a better life cycle assessment of the road structure. The company is also working on masonry cements in France and Romania with a carbon footprint that is 50 percent lower than pure cement while ensuring enhanced properties like workability or wall adhesion. With Airium LafargeHolcim has developed an innovative, safe, green, durable and affordable insulation alternative to traditional insulation. Priority countries for this solution include France, Austria, Switzerland and Poland. LafargeHolcim is a preferred building materials partner for low-carbon construction solutions. Its innovative concrete and cement products allow for CO2 savings of up to 70 percent compared to standard Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) products. The company is committed to continuous carbon intensity reduction of its portfolio, as demonstrated by its leadership position on carbon efficiency (576kg CO2 \/ ton of cementitious material in 2018) as well as an ambitious 2030 target (520kg CO2 per ton of cementitious material) aligned with the 2°C scenario of the Paris COP21 climate agreement.

Jan Jenisch, CEO: \"2019 was a very successful year for us and we achieved record results in Operating profit, Net income, EPS and Free Cash Flow. Our sharp decrease in net debt has significantly strengthened our balance sheet. We have achieved all our targets for 2019 and have moved our company to a new level of performance. On top of these record financial results, we strengthened our leadership in sustainability by setting more ambitious targets for carbon emissions and by joining the Science-Based Target initiative. We introduced our first carbon-neutral concrete in key markets and will further focus on expanding our range of low-carbon building solutions. I congratulate all our employees and teams on these impressive results and would like to thank them for their dedication and efforts in making this possible. We stand in solidarity with our colleagues in our Chinese operations and in our joint venture Huaxin in view of the current coronavirus crisis. We are taking all necessary measures to protect the health of our employees and their families.\" ##### A RECORD PERFORMANCE. Midway through Strategy 2022 \"Building for Growth\" LafargeHolcim has achieved almost all 2022 targets. The company significantly strengthened its balance sheet and is now well positioned to continue growing profitably with strong market positions in all regions. On top, eight bolt-on acquisitions in the attractive Ready-Mix and Aggregates markets have been accomplished in 2019. Net sales of CHF 26,722 million grew 3.1 on a like-for-like basis compared to the prior year, driven by good growth in Europe and North America, good price dynamics across all business segments and higher prices in most markets. Recurring EBITDA1 reached CHF 6,153 million, up 6.5 like-for-like for the full year, driven by good pricing, improvement in efficiencies and our CHF 400 million SG&A cost savings program. The Recurring EBITDA margin1 increased from 21.9 in 2018 to 23 in 2019. Record Net income2 of CHF 2,072 million increased by 32 compared to 2018 (CHF 1,569 million), driven by less restructuring costs, lower financial expenses as well as a decrease in the tax rate. Earnings per Share3 were up by 29 accordingly to reach CHF 3.40 for the full year 2019 versus CHF 2.63 for 2018. Record Free Cash Flow1generation of CHF 3,047 million (+79 ) and strong improvement of cash conversion1reaching 49.5 , well above the target of 40 , as defined in Strategy 2022 - \"Building for Growth\". This achievement reflects reduced cash paid for tax, financial and restructuring costs as well as improved net working capital. Net debt1 was substantially reduced by CHF 4.7 billion (-35 ) to CHF 8.8 billion at year-end 2019, reflecting the strong Free Cash Flow and the positive impact following the sale of Indonesia and Malaysia. This resulted in a significant deleveraging with a ratio of Net debt to Recurring EBITDA of 1.4x1 (2.2x in 2018). Return on Invested Capital1 (ROIC) was a strong 7.6 for 2019, close to the 2022 target of above 8 and compared to 6.5 in the previous year. ROIC is now above cost of capital thanks to higher profitability, lower tax rate and disciplined Capex. In 2019, LafargeHolcim delivered a record performance and reached a new level of financial strength which puts the company in a perfect position for further profitable growth for the second half of Strategy 2022 and beyond. ##### STRENGTHENING LEADERSHIP IN SUSTAINABILITY. In 2019, LafargeHolcim made significant progress in reducing its carbon footprint. Compared to 2018 the company reduced its net CO2 scope 1 emissions per ton of cementitious material by 1.4 5 to 561 kg\/ton in 2019, nearly meeting its 2022 target of 560 kg\/ton. Given this strong progress, the company has revised its 2022 target to 550 kg\/ton as it moves to reduce its carbon footprint to 520 kg\/ton by 2030. In 2019, the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has validated the targets to reduce the company’s global carbon footprint as adequate and consistent with the effort to keep temperatures below the ‘2°C’ threshold agreed at the COP21 world climate conference in Paris. Compared to 1990, the company had already reduced its directly attributable (‘scope 1’) net CO2 emissions per ton of cementitious material by 27 , by far the leader among international cement groups. In October 2019, Chief Sustainability Officer Magali Anderson was appointed as a member of the Group Executive Committee, underlining LafargeHolcim’s industry leadership in regard to social and ecological responsibility. Recently LafargeHolcim introduced its first fully carbon-neutral concrete6 in Switzerland and Germany, demonstrating the company’s move toward building a global family of carbon-neutral products. To keep up this momentum, the company has also revised its incentive scheme so that one-third of the Executive Committee’s performance share rewards is based on progress in carbon emissions, waste recycling and freshwater withdrawal. The health and safety component of the annual incentive scheme will also include a scorecard including both leading and lagging performance metrics. Both changes to the incentives scheme begin in 2020. ##### OUTLOOK 2020. For 2020, LafargeHolcim anticipates a continued solid market environment:. * Continued market growth in North America. * Improving market conditions in Latin America. * Continued demand growth across most countries in Europe. * Challenging market conditions in Middle East Africa. * Demand growth in India, challenging environment in China. This outlook doesn't take into account the impact that the Coronavirus (COVID-19) might have on the operating results in China. Based on the above trends and the successful execution of Strategy 2022, we are confident to achieve the following targets for 2020:. * Net sales growth of 3 to 5 on a like-for-like basis. * Recurring EBIT* growth of at least 7 7 on a like-for-like basis. * Ratio of Net debt to Recurring EBITDA below 2 times by the end of 2020. * Cash conversion of 40. * Capex and bolt-on acquisitions of less than CHF 2 billion. For the 2019 financial year, the Board of Directors is proposing a cash dividend of CHF 2.00 per registered share, subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 12 May 2020. The dividend will be fully paid out of the foreign capital contribution reserve and is not subject to Swiss withholding tax. * LafargeHolcim announces Recurring EBIT as its new key performance indicator starting in 2020, replacing Recurring EBITDA. The new indicator provides full transparency and accountability under IFRS 16 as it fully captures operational achievements and better reflects financial discipline on investments. The key performance indicator changes from the previously used Recurring EBITDA growth of at least 5 like-for-like to Recurring EBIT growth of at least 7 like-for-like. ##### KEY GROUP FIGURES 2019.

Depreciation and amortization pre-IFRS 16 stood at CHF 2,096 million versus CHF 2,235 million in 2018, reflecting the divestment in South East Asia and discipline in Capex. Restructuring, litigation, implementation and other non-recurring costs stood at CHF 190 million, compared to CHF 476 million in 2018 and CHF 461 million in 2017. 2019 restructuring costs amounted to CHF 101 million, reflecting the completion of the implementation of the SG&A savings program. Profit and Loss on disposals and other non-operating items amounted to CHF 186 million, reflecting mainly the capital gain on the Indonesia and Malaysia divestments. Net financial expenses pre-IFRS 16 for 2019 amounted to CHF 638 million versus CHF 886 million in the prior year, a strong improvement by CHF 248 million. This was driven by refinancing actions and deleverage. The income tax rate pre-IFRS 16 excluding impairment and divestments was 26 , 1.7 percentage points lower than in 2018. Reflecting all the above, 2019 Net income group share amounted to CHF 2,246 million. Excluding impairment and divestments, EPS pre-IFRS 16 was up 29.1 to CHF 3.40 for 2019. On a reported basis, EPS was CHF 3.69 for 2019. Net capital expenditure for 2019 was CHF 1,396 million. Free Cash Flow pre-IFRS 16 stood at CHF 3,047 million, up 79.0 compared to 2018. This led to a ratio of cash conversion pre-IFRS 16, defined as Free Cash Flow relative to Recurring EBITDA, of 49.5 in 2019. ##### RECONCILIATION TO GROUP ACCOUNTS.

{"id":7797,"text":"LafargeHolcim announces it will work with IBM Services to further develop the first digital platform for road design optimization, ORIS. The solution can reduce road project costs by up to one-third and carbon emissions by up to half while tripling road durability and usage lifespans. ORIS allows decision-makers, road infrastructure authorities and project investors to improve road construction and sustainability and reduce inefficiencies through smart project design. This is especially timely as governments design stimulus packages to revive economic activity post COVID-19 while also responding to the impact of climate change. An average of 700,000 kilometres (435,000 miles) of new roads are being built globally every year. Improving road quality and resilience will help reduce the massive amount of carbon emissions attributed to transportation. Because roads vary depending on location, climate, vehicle types and traffic volumes, it is a complex challenge to define the most sustainable and cost-effective mix of building materials and technologies early in the design phase. ORIS assesses road pavement designs from different perspectives and recommends efficient construction and maintenance patterns with local materials availability and capabilities. ORIS is supporting public policies that conserve natural resources, enabling a more local and circular economy in road construction. \"We are accelerating the digitalization of our solutions for sustainable and high-performance construction,\" said Marcel Cobuz, Region Head of Europe, Member of the Executive Committee with responsibility for innovation at LafargeHolcim on a global level. \"With global solutions like ORIS, we are committed to leading the way in low-carbon and circular construction as well as responsible natural resource consumption for roads and beyond. We have already entered into pilots with different partners such as road authorities, international financing institutions and engineering firms to use ORIS in both developed and emerging markets.\" LafargeHolcim will leverage IBM's portfolio of digital platforms, hybrid clouds, digital design services, as well as IBM's expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, industrial Internet-of-Things and data analytics to enhance even further its materials knowledge in cement and ready-mix concrete products, as well as its solutions and products, including precast concrete, asphalt, mortar and building solutions. \"Data-driven solutions and digital technologies have the potential to transform road construction towards more sustainable, circular, low-carbon, low-resource and cost-efficient techniques. ORIS is instrumental in recommending appropriate and tailored approaches to road-building, thus minimizing costs, environmental impacts and project delays,\" says Hervé Rolland, Vice President, Industrial solutions, IBM Europe. \"IBM Services help businesses establish the right industry-relevant platforms that support rapid digitization, standardization and simplification, as well as vertically integrating both industrial and business operations.\" About LafargeHolcim.

{"id":7800,"text":"* Carbon capture portfolio now exceeds 20 projects across the US, Canada and Europe. * Latest project addition in Spain, where CO2 will increase farm efficiency. * Partner in three-year project funded by the European Union. LafargeHolcim’s portfolio of carbon capture projects was recently reinforced as the United States Department of Energy’s National Energy Laboratory Technology (DOE-NETL) announced that it will support the LH CO2MENT Colorado Project. This follows funding by the German government of the Westküste 100 project, which was announced in August. LafargeHolcim and consortium partners Svante Inc, Oxy Low Carbon Ventures LLC (OLCV) and Total have completed a study to assess the viability and design of a commercial-scale carbon-capture facility. With the confirmation of DOE-NETL funding, the partnership has committed to the next project phase to evaluate the feasibility of the facility designed to capture up to two million tons of CO2 per year directly from the Holcim cement plant and the natural gas-fired steam generator, which would be sequestered underground permanently by Occidental. The Westküste 100 project in Germany also received the go-ahead and funding approval from the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy in August. In this project, CO2 from the LafargeHolcim Lägerdorf plant will be transformed with green hydrogen into a synthetic fuel. The potential carbon capture capacity for the cement plant is approximately one million tons of CO2 per year. Westküste 100 (www.westkueste 100.de) is a ten-company consortium focused on the creation of low-carbon solutions and end-to-end sustainable business practices across industries. LafargeHolcim recently added to its portfolio of CCUS pilots with the ECCO2-LH project in Spain, in collaboration with Carbon Clean and Sistemas de Calor, which will capture CO2 from flue gas at its Carboneras plant and turn it to agricultural use for accelerated crop production. This will increase farm efficiency by reducing water and soil consumption ratio per kg of vegetable production. Starting with 10 of CO2 emissions from 2022, the commercial applicability of this viable CO2 circular economy business model can potentially leverage 700,000 tons of CO2 and achieve 100 decarbonization at the plant. Chief Sustainability Officer, Magali Anderson: \"Carbon capture, usage and storage will most likely play a key role in many industries' decarbonization journey. That’s why we are multiplying our pilots to test various scenarios with the ambition of reaching effective, affordable and scalable solutions. It is very encouraging to receive the support of funders such as the US and German governments, as partnering with like-minded organizations is key to scale up our impact.\" LafargeHolcim is expanding its CCUS portfolio with more than twenty projects across the US, Canada and Europe. Overall these ongoing CCUS projects could save approximately four million tons of CO2 per year. This expanding range of projects is designed to give the company maximum flexibility in applying CCUS technologies. The best solutions in terms of technology and cost efficiency could be replicated in other plants in selected regions, advancing the company’s CO2 reduction journey and adding value in the form of CO2-related materials, thereby creating new growth opportunities for the company. Working with other multinationals as well as start-ups, CCUS pilots are evaluated in terms of cost, technical feasibility, compatibility with CO2 usage opportunities and other aspects of viability and scalability. With the coordination of the LafargeHolcim Innovation Center in Lyon, the company also participates in a three-year project funded by the European Union to support the development of low-carbon energy and industry in Southern and Eastern Europe1. The company’s objective is to work from a long menu of carbon capture, usage and storage solutions, combining them in different ways and environments to assess their potential.

Recurring EBIT (CHFm) 2,639 3,085 -14.5 -7.2. Jan Jenisch, CEO: \"As we navigate the pandemic, our number one priority is to keep our people and communities safe. I would like to sincerely thank all our people who are going above and beyond to make this happen around the world. In particular, I would like to applaud our many front-line workers who have never stopped providing products and services to our customers during these challenging times. \"Our third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our business and the strength of our decentralized, empowered operating model. I am very proud of our team’s agility in executing our action plan ‘HEALTH, COST & CASH’ ahead of targets. Our third quarter performance demonstrates a strong resilience in demand for our products and an over-proportional increase in margins. \"I expect a solid closing of 2020 resulting in a Free Cash Flow of above CHF 2.75 billion and a strong balance sheet that will allow us to pursue growth opportunities. We accelerated our ambition to lead the way in green construction with our net zero pledge and partnership with the Science-Based Targets initiative. I am very proud of the global launch of our green concrete, ECOPact, earlier this year, as well as our EcoLabel, to transparently share the environmental benefits of our products.\" This quarter’s results confirmed the resilience of LafargeHolcim’s strategy, the agility of its decentralized business model, the rigorous execution of its action plan \"HEALTH, COST & CASH\" and the company’s strong financial position. In addition, the Group saw an increase in revenues from its branded products, which are sold across its broad distribution and retail network. For example, the company recorded a volume increase of 5% in its cement bag sales. ##### Strong margin expansion across all regions. Recurring EBIT margin expanded across all regions in Q3 as volumes continued to recover across most geographies. This improvement was achieved largely due to the strong margin increase in cement and disciplined cost management under the \"HEALTH, COST & CASH\" action plan, leading to an improvement in the Group’s Recurring EBIT margin of 250 basis points. Recurring EBIT growth of 10.0% in Q3 was achieved despite a decline in net sales of 2.6% , both on a like-for-like basis. Despite a negative currency translation impact, which remained high in the three-month period, total Recurring EBIT increased by 1.9% in the third quarter. ##### \"HEALTH, COST & CASH\" action plan delivering well ahead of targets. In March 2020, LafargeHolcim launched the action plan \"HEALTH, COST & CASH\" to safeguard the health and safety of its people, partners and communities, while mitigating the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the end of the third quarter, the company has over-achieved its cost savings targets. Fixed costs in the first nine months were reduced by CHF 396 million on a like-for-like basis compared to 2019, surpassing the initial target of CHF 300 million for the full year. In addition, the reduction in energy prices has led to savings of CHF 124 million on a like-for-like basis in the first nine months compared to 2019. Reduction of CAPEX and Net Working Capital are also above target. ##### Q3 Regional performance. Markets in the Europe region recovered with the Recurring EBIT margin up strongly in the third quarter. Net sales were back on last year’s level, with stronger cement demand in Western and Central Europe than in the third quarter of 2019 and softer volumes in Eastern Europe. The Recurring EBIT margin improvement of 230 basis points was driven by execution of the cost action plan and effective price management. The North America region delivered improved Recurring EBIT margin. Volumes in all business segments were impacted by COVID-19 and an unfavorable comparison base due to deferred sales. The strong Recurring EBIT margin was supported by an over-proportional cost decline compared to volumes as well as effective price management. The region was impacted by the slowdown in the oil & gas industry in Western Canada. The Latin America region delivered an outstanding performance with strong cement demand recovery in Mexico and Brazil and excellent cost savings initiatives across the region in the third quarter. The significant Recurring EBIT growth was over-proportional to net sales and price management was efficient overall. The Recurring EBIT growth of the Asia Pacific region in the third quarter was driven by resilient volumes and strong operational efficiency in India. Volumes in China were above last year’s level, partially offset by softer markets in the Philippines and Australia. Recurring EBIT margin expansion was supported by effective cost and price management. The successful turnaround drove a strong performance in the quarter for the Middle East Africa region. The result was supported by resilient demand, strong volume growth in Nigeria, strict cost discipline and successful turnaround initiatives. These factors helped drive an expansion in the Recurring EBIT margin for the region of 350 basis points in the third quarter. ##### Accelerating sustainability. In September, LafargeHolcim joined the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) \"Business Ambition for 1.5°C,\" becoming the first global building materials company to sign the Net Zero pledge with 2030 targets validated by SBTi1 . In addition, LafargeHolcim is partnering with SBTi to develop its 1.5°C cement roadmap beyond 2030, a first in its industry. This commitment builds on LafargeHolcim’s leadership in green construction with solutions such as ECOPact, its green concrete, and Susteno, its leading circular cement. By 2030, LafargeHolcim will:. * Accelerate the use of green building solutions, with the launch of EcoLabel and the global rollout of green concrete ECOPact. * Double the recycling of materials across its businesses to reach 100m tons. * Scale up the use of calcined clay and develop novel cements with new binders. * Reach 475 kg net CO2 per ton of cementitious material (net CO2\/t.cem). * Operate its first net zero carbon cement production facility. In addition to these commitments, the company launched a EUR 3 billion commercial paper program, linking the cost of funds to its ESG performance, and marked its first sustainable deposit, leveraging its finance activities to advance the UN Sustainable Development Group’s goals. This follows LafargeHolcim’s number-one ESG ranking in the construction sector by Sustainalytics in 2020. ##### Outlook. As a result of the ongoing uncertainties in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of visibility, it remains very difficult to provide an outlook. However LafargeHolcim is confident about the future, based on the resilience of its strategy, the agility of its decentralized business model, the rigorous execution of its action plan \"HEALTH, COST & CASH\" and its strong financial position. The company confirms its outlook:. * Resilient demand expected for the fourth quarter of 2020. * Execution of action plan \"HEALTH, COST & CASH\" to continue ahead of targets. * 2020 Free Cash Flow guidance increased to above CHF 2.75 bn based on strong Q3 performance. * Strong balance sheet, debt leverage below 1.8x. ##### Key figures.

{"id":7807,"text":"● CHF 100m investment in waste heat recovery across six sites in India to reduce 0.5 million tons of CO2 emissions per year. ● Thermal heat electricity part of reducing energy-related emissions by 65 by 2030. ● Builds on company’s partnerships with power producers worldwide to accelerate use of renewable energy. Holcim announces its CHF 100m investment in India in waste heat recovery systems to accelerate its net zero journey. This investment across six sites will be completed in the next two years, doubling Holcim’s waste heat recovery systems, which use thermal heat to produce decarbonized electricity. As part of its net zero roadmap, Holcim aims to reduce its scope 2 emissions by 65 by 2030 compared to its 2018 baseline. This objective will be delivered through a number of measures, from waste heat recovery to investing in renewable energy. Scope 2 includes indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed in the company’s owned or controlled equipment. The company is also actively partnering with power producers worldwide to install renewable energy facilities across its sites and increase its share of renewable energy from the grid. For example, Holcim has installed wind turbines at its Paulding plant in the United States that eliminate at least 9,000 tons of CO2 annually. In Argentina, over 30 of electricity comes from renewable sources. Most recently in Leffe, Belgium, the company is setting up a wind power plant that will supply more than 75 of its quarry’s electricity. Magali Anderson, Chief Sustainability Officer, says: \"On our net zero journey, we set ourselves an ambitious scope 2 target. I am very excited to see India leading the way by investing CHF 100m in waste heat recovery. This major step forward builds on our procurement teams’ work in renewable energy.\" \"Procurement plays a key role in Holcim’s climate action. That’s why we are engaging in a number of renewable energy partnerships around the world to install wind turbines and solar panel farms to power our sites. In addition, we are purchasing energy from renewable sources wherever it is feasible,\" adds Mario Gross, Chief Procurement Officer. About Holcim.

{"id":7809,"text":"* First application of 3D printing technology at scale for schools in Africa, starting in Malawi. * Building homes at record speed with optimized material use and a reduced carbon footprint by 70. * Addressing Malawi’s 70-year schools backlog within just 10 years. 14Trees, a Holcim joint venture with CDC Group, the UK’s publicly owned impact investor, is deploying 3D printing technology at scale to build affordable and low-carbon housing and schools in Africa, starting in Malawi. With its record speed of construction and optimised material use, this technology reduces the carbon footprint for building new homes by up to 70 . Pioneering this technology in schools for the first time, 14Trees aims to address the country’s chronic infrastructure shortage while creating skilled local jobs. Miljan Gutovic, Region Head Middle East Africa and Holcim Executive Committee member, said: \"I am very excited about the work of our joint venture 14Trees, innovating in 3D printing technology to accelerate affordable and sustainable building, from homes to schools. This is a great example of our commitment to build for people and the planet. Starting in Malawi, we will deploy this technology across the broader region with projects already in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\" Tenbite Ermias, Managing Director, Africa, at CDC said: \"The rollout of 14Trees’ world-class, cutting-edge technology is going to have a tremendous developmental impact on Malawi and the wider region. It is a wonderful example of how we are investing in businesses that can support the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.\" Using proprietary Holcim ink, this innovative 3D printing process will significantly reduce the time and cost of building housing and schools in Malawi. UNICEF estimates a shortage of 36,000 classrooms in Malawi which would take 70 years to build using conventional methods. According to 14Trees, this infrastructure gap could be bridged in just ten years using 3D printing. Partnering with a range of NGOs, 14Trees is committed to solving this chronic shortage at scale, starting with families and communities most in need. The project in Malawi relied on local 14Trees teams trained by Holcim and COBOD, the 3D printing specialists. The teams included 3D machine operators, architects, civil and structural engineers and materials specialists. The project also involved nearly forty people in the preparation of the 3D ink and in the construction with building trades such as carpenters, roofers and painters. The walls of 14Trees’ first prototype house were built in Lilongwe in just 12 hours, compared to almost 4 days using conventional methods. The walls of its first school, built in Salima, were printed in just 18 hours, as opposed to several days. About Holcim.

Free Cash Flow after leases (CHFm) 3,249 3,019 +7.6. Net financial debt (CHFm) 8,483 10,110 -16.1. Jan Jenisch, CEO: \"2020 was an unprecedented year for everyone, challenging us to be more resilient, while stepping up to take care of those around us. I sincerely thank everyone within LafargeHolcim for their strong contributions, enabling us to navigate these difficult times. I’m extremely proud of how our teams mobilized to keep our people and operations safe, while going above and beyond to stand by our communities. Together we touched the lives of over six million people around the world this year. \"This crisis has really proven the resilience of our strategy and business model. By Q4 we were back to growth, with a 1.5% increase in net sales and over-proportional Recurring EBIT of 14.1% . We are emerging stronger from the crisis, reaching a new level of financial performance this year. We delivered a record free cash flow of CHF 3.2 billion and reduced our net debt by CHF 1.6 billion. Staying focused on our growth agenda, we completed eight bolt-ons in 2020 and signed an agreement to acquire Firestone Building Products, the iconic leader in flat-roofing systems in the US. \"We accelerated our climate action, from our net zero pledge to the global launch of our ECOPact green concrete, all the way to making it into CDP’s A list for climate. Every ton of cement we produced in 2020 was more carbon-efficient and contained more recycled material than the year before. \"We are going into 2021 with strong momentum. We expect further demand in H2 2021 from a broad range of stimulus programs. We are firmly on track to become the global leader in innovative and sustainable building materials and solutions.\" ### STRONG FINISH TO THE YEAR AND RECORD FREE CASH FLOW2. Net sales of CHF 23,142 million were -5.6% on a like-for-like basis (LFL) compared to the prior year and -13.4% on a reported basis. The like-for-like decline mainly results from the pandemic-related disruption, mostly in H1, before returning to prior-year levels in H2. In the context of the global crisis, all currencies depreciated against the Swiss Franc, which generated a negative translation effect of -7.4% . Recurring EBIT reached CHF 3,676 million, -10.4% in total and -1.9% LFL for the full year, with a largely ‘V-shaped’ recovery across all regions delivering a Q4 improvement of 14.1% LFL compared to the prior-year period. Net Income3 was CHF 1,900 million, 7.5% lower than in 2019 reflecting the above-mentioned Recurring EBIT decline, partly offset by the reduction of restructuring, litigation and other non-recurring costs, along with the continuous improvement of the financial expenses and income tax rate. Earnings per share4 were down by 8.7% to reach CHF 3.07 for the full year 2020 versus CHF 3.37 for 2019. Free Cash Flow after leases was at CHF 3,249 million versus CHF 3,019 million in 2019, up 7.6% , reflecting the success of the \"HEALTH, COST & CASH\" action plan. Net debt amounted to CHF 8.5 billion at year-end 2020, a reduction of CHF 1.6 billion compared to the prior year. The ratio of net debt to Recurring EBITDA now stands at 1.4, over-delivering on the 2022 target. Return on Invested Capital was 7.4% in 2020, equivalent to the previous year, as the company remains on track to achieve its 2022 target of above 8.0% 5. ### FAST EXECUTION OF \"HEALTH, COST & CASH\" ACTION PLAN. Through agile and effective crisis management, the company’s action plan \"HEALTH, COST & CASH,\" launched in March 2020, has successfully safeguarded the health and safety of its people, partners and communities, while mitigating the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fixed costs were reduced by CHF 385 million on a like-for-like basis compared to 2019, far surpassing the initial target of CHF 300 million for the full year. In addition, the reduction in energy prices has led to savings of CHF 125 million on a like-for-like basis compared to 2019. CAPEX was CHF 370 million lower, at CHF 1.0 billion, while working capital was reduced by 11 days on sales. These efforts were pivotal in generating our record free cash flow after leases of CHF 3.2 billion and Recurring EBIT margin improvement across all regions for 2020. GOOD PROGRESS ON SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS. LafargeHolcim accelerated its climate action this year with the launch of its net zero pledge, as a signatory of the \"Business Ambition for 1.5°C.\" The company set for itself the most ambitious climate targets of its industry, validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to reach net carbon emissions of 475 kilograms of CO2 per ton of cementitious materials (kg net CO2\/per ton) by 2030. Making progress on its net zero journey, LafargeHolcim delivered a record-low level of 555 kg net CO2\/per ton this year. In addition, LafargeHolcim is partnering with SBTi to set the first net zero cement roadmap in its industry. At the forefront of sustainable building solutions, the company rolled-out its green concrete ECOPact globally, now in 14 countries, offering concrete with lower CO2 emissions and recycled content. This was followed by the global launch of the company’s EcoLabel to transparently disclose the environmental profile of its green products, applying to all cement and concrete with at least 30% lower CO2 footprint or 20% recycled content. The company issued the building materials industry’s first sustainability-linked bond, bringing its total ESG-linked funding agreements close to CHF 6 billion, and was recognized as a climate leader by CDP, entering its prestigious ‘A list’ for Climate. MILESTONE ACQUISITION OF FIRESTONE BUILDING PRODUCTS. In January 2021, LafargeHolcim signed an agreement to acquire Firestone Building Products (FSBP). FSBP is a leader in commercial roofing and building envelope solutions based in the United States (US). Its 2020 net sales and EBITDA were even higher than the estimates provided in January (USD 1.8 billion and USD 270 million, respectively). The deal is now expected to close earlier than planned, with a very good outlook in 2021 based on encouraging January trends. In addition, this acquisition positions the company strongly to benefit from the expected USD 2 trillion \"Build Back Better\" plan. This transaction is valued at USD 3.4 billion and will be financed with cash and debt while maintaining debt leverage below 2x. This acquisition is a milestone in LafargeHolcim’s transformation to become the global leader in innovative and sustainable building solutions. CHANGES IN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. Building on the Firestone transaction, the Board of Directors has decided to create a new position at the Group Executive Committee level to lead the Solutions & Products Global Business Unit. Jamie Gentoso, currently Chief Executive Officer of US Cement, has been appointed to lead this business effective March 1st 2021. Ms. Gentoso brings an outstanding track record in business development and driving growth. The new role will align the vision to develop the fourth business segment Solutions & Products into a strong driver of growth and sustainability for the company. To further improve the company’s simplicity and efficiency, the Board of Directors has decided to integrate the regions Europe and Middle East Africa (MEA) into one new region: Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Miljan Gutovic, the current Head of Region MEA is appointed to take over the responsibility of the broader Region EMEA, effective March 1st 2021. Marcel Cobuz has decided to leave LafargeHolcim to pursue new opportunities outside the company. He leaves a strong legacy of business growth throughout his twenty year career, taking on increasing responsibilities across Europe, the Middle East Africa and Asia and played an instrumental role in the merger of Lafarge and Holcim. The company’s profit & loss responsibility is now assigned to the five leaders of Region EMEA, Region North America, Region Latin America, Region Asia Pacific and the Solutions & Products Global Business Unit. OUTLOOK 2021. LafargeHolcim expects good demand momentum in 2021, with positive trends in all regions. Extra demand is expected in H2 2021 from stimulus programs, as governments announce measures to support the economic recovery with a focus on infrastructure. LafargeHolcim is ready to support these programs around the world, from the CHF 2 trillion ‘Build Back Better’ plan in the US, to the nearly CHF 2 trillion expected from India’s ‘National Infrastructure Pipeline’ plan, and the UK’s CHF 800 billion infrastructure plan. The company aspires to globalize the Firestone Building Products business in 2021, to accelerate bolt-on acquisitions and to continue to progress on its 2030 sustainability targets. LafargeHolcim further expects:. * Recurring EBIT growth of at least 7% LFL in line with Strategy 2022. * Cash conversion of above 40% and debt leverage below 2x. * Capex less than CHF 1.4bn. For the 2020 financial year, the Board of Directors is proposing a dividend from the foreign capital contribution reserve in the amount of CHF 2.00 per registered share, subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2021.

Jan Jenisch, CEO: \"I am pleased to share that we are off to a strong start to the year, delivering record Q1 results, with net sales up 7.4% and Recurring EBIT up 131%. This continues our strong growth momentum of the last quarters, and we expect it to accelerate with the Firestone Building Products acquisition and the many government stimulus investments ahead. We are set to deliver the targets of Strategy 2022 one year in advance. \"The pandemic has emphasized for all of us the need to build back a better normal. We are fully committed to playing our part. For instance, in the US, we are ready to contribute to President Biden’s American Jobs Plan, offering a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebuild infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, in a more sustainable way, while making buildings more energy-efficient. With our sustainable building solutions, from Firestone’s insulating roofing systems to our ECOPact green concrete, we are committed to deploying our technologies at scale to put climate action at the heart of the recovery. \"I would like to sincerely thank everyone within LafargeHolcim for their continued resilience and agility throughout the pandemic. I’m extremely proud of how our teams are keeping our people and operations safe, while going above and beyond to stand by our communities. Our number one priority remains the health and safety of all.\" #### Growth momentum continues, over-proportional EBIT increase. The company got off to a record start to 2021, led by net sales improving by 7.4% and an increase in Recurring EBIT of 130.7% compared to the prior year period, both on a like-for-like basis. Cement volumes grew by 5.6% for the Group and Ready-Mix Concrete volumes grew by 2.2%, while Aggregates volumes decreased by 4.0%, all on a like-for-like basis. All regions showed significant increase in Recurring EBIT margin. The Europe region showed good momentum with a strong increase in margin. Performance in March was excellent, with strong volumes in all segments and strong pricing trends overall. Market conditions improved in the UK and demand in France continued to be strong. These factors led to over-proportional Recurring EBIT growth compared to net sales. The Middle East Africa region delivered strong improvement in Recurring EBIT margin. The region returned to cement volume growth, driven by branded product sales. Good trends in Iraq, Kenya and Nigeria led to strong Recurring EBIT margin improvement of 380 basis points versus the prior year. North America showed good momentum with volume back to the 2019 level despite unfavorable weather at the start of the year. Market demand in the US was strong and Canada West, which had been affected by a slowdown in the oil & gas sector, showed signs of stabilization. The Recurring EBIT margin for the region improved by 170 basis points versus the prior year. The Latin America region continued its outstanding performance, with volume growth in all business segments. Strong cement demand growth was driven by residential and infrastructure sectors. The region delivered an excellent operational performance, with a record Recurring EBIT margin improvement of 810 basis points versus the prior year. The Asia Pacific region showed record performance with strong growth in cement volumes. India’s outstanding performance was supported by excellent volumes as well as effective price and cost management. Improving activities in Australia were supported by government stimulus programs. The region achieved a record Recurring EBIT margin expansion of 730 basis points versus the prior year. #### Firestone acquisition successfully closed. The transaction to buy Firestone Building Products successfully closed on March 31st, 2021. The acquisition represents a milestone in the transformation of LafargeHolcim to become the global leader in innovative and sustainable building solutions. All 1,900 employees joined LafargeHolcim. Firestone Building Products will be part of the newly established Global Business Unit Solutions & Products, under the direction of Jamie Gentoso, who has been appointed to the Group Executive Committee. Firestone Building Products is the market leader in commercial roofing and building envelope solutions in the United States with net sales above USD 1.8 billion in 2020, 15 manufacturing facilities, 1,800 distribution points and three R&D laboratories. It will remain headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. The 2021 outlook for Firestone Building Products is strong, with results to date above expectations. In addition, LafargeHolcim completed four bolt-on acquisitions across Europe in the quarter. Notable bolt-ons include Edile Commerciale and Cemex Rhone Alpes, both suppliers of ready-mix concrete and aggregates, ideally located in two of Europe’s largest metropolitan areas, Milan, Italy, and Lyon, France. With 35 ready-mix concrete plants, these operations strengthen LafargeHolcim’s position in two of the most dynamic and attractive areas in Europe, with strong demographic trends and key infrastructure projects. LafargeHolcim also announced its investment in XtreeE, a French start-up specializing in large-scale 3D printing, in the first quarter. #### Strengthening leadership in sustainability. In addition to its record financial results, LafargeHolcim has continued to advance on its leading sustainability achievements in 2021. Vigeo.Eiris, the environmental, sustainability and governance (ESG) rating and research agency, has ranked LafargeHolcim as number one in its sector, giving the company its highest rating of A1+. LafargeHolcim was also named best in its sector in terms of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. This rating places LafargeHolcim within the top 2% of companies ranked worldwide. The Solar Impulse Foundation endorsed ten LafargeHolcim green building solutions with its Solar Impulse Foundation efficient solution label. The labelled solutions contributed to the Solar Impulse Foundation’s challenge of identifying 1,000 clean technologies that protect the environment in a profitable way. Each awarded solution was strictly assessed by a pool of independent experts. Among the recognized products is ECOPact green concrete, which was launched globally in July 2020 and is now available in 16 countries, including the US and India, with an accelerated rollout ahead. ECOPact is complemented by the company’s EcoLabel, which has been deployed across 100 products around the world to transparently communicate their environmental profile, with at least 30% lower CO2 footprint, or 20% recycled content. Other notable events in the quarter include LafargeHolcim’s engagement as a founding member in the MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium (MCSC). Working with MIT’s world-class research teams, LafargeHolcim is working alongside a cross section of industry leaders to develop innovation-driven solutions to tackle climate change. LafargeHolcim also committed to publish its first Climate Transition report in 2022 and will submit it for shareholder approval at the 2022 Annual General Meeting. #### Outlook. LafargeHolcim expects positive demand trends in all regions, to be accelerated as of H2 2021 from various stimulus programs, as governments announce measures to support the economic recovery with a focus on infrastructure. LafargeHolcim is ready to contribute to these programs around the world, from the CHF 2 trillion ‘Build Back Better’ plan in the US, to the nearly CHF 2 trillion expected from India’s ‘National Infrastructure Pipeline’ plan, and the UK’s CHF 800 billion infrastructure plan. The company expects to develop the Firestone Building Products business in 2021, to accelerate bolt-on acquisitions and to continue to progress on its 2030 sustainability targets. LafargeHolcim further expects to achieve all Strategy 2022 targets one year in advance, delivering:. * Net sales growth of 3%-5% LFL. * Over-proportional growth in Recurring EBIT of at least 10% LFL. * Return on invested capital above 8%. * Cash conversion of above 40%. * Debt leverage below 2x. * Capex less than CHF 1.4bn. #### Group and regional figures.

{"id":7827,"text":"• Holcim-CDC joint venture 14Trees builds world’s first 3D-printed school. • Built with minimal material use and carbon footprint at record speed. • Potential to bridge world’s infrastructure gap at scale. Holcim announces the world’s first school built with 3D printing (3DP), developed with CDC Group, the UK’s development finance institution. The school was built in Malawi’s Salima district (pop. 38,000), and its walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to several days with conventional building materials. The school has this week been officially transferred to the Kalonga village community in the Yambe zone of Salima district. Children began learning in their new school on June 21. The school is proof that 3D printing can play a key role in bridging our world’s education infrastructure gap by building high-quality classrooms for children in a sustainable, affordable and fast-paced way at scale. Miljan Gutovic, Region Head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Holcim Group: \"I am very proud of how our colleagues at 14Trees have deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to solve such an essential infrastructure need. Now that we’ve proven the concept in Malawi, we look forward to scaling up this technology across the broader region, with projects already in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\" Tenbite Ermias, Managing Director, Africa, at CDC, said: \"The rollout of 14Trees’ world-class, cutting-edge technology is going to have a tremendous developmental impact on Malawi and the wider region. It is a wonderful example of how we are investing in businesses that can support the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.\" Juliana Kuphanga Chikandila, Primary Education Advisor, representing the Director of Education, Youth and Sports in Malawi: \"Before, we had 12 schools in the Yambe zone; we now have 13 – with this new 3D printed school. To increase our supply of education to children, we need a total of four more primary schools in the Yambe zone, but as a district, we need approximately 50 more schools to serve those in need. I am very impressed by the new building – its durability and design provide the space and facilities that students did not have before; teaching and learning can now happen inside and outside the classroom. It is notably different from the schools being built in the Yambe zone and Salima district. This school will attract more students, and those learners that had left will return to education.\" Using proprietary Holcim ink, this innovative 3D printing process significantly reduces the time, cost and materials used for building housing and schools, while reducing their environmental footprint by more than 50 compared to conventional methods. In Malawi alone, UNICEF estimates a shortage of 36,000 classrooms which would take 70 years to build using conventional methods. According to 14Trees, this infrastructure gap could be bridged in just ten years with 3D printing. Partnering with a range of NGOs, 14Trees is committed to solving this chronic shortage at scale and sustainably, starting with families and communities most in need.\" These projects will sustain skilled job creation by hiring and upskilling local experts in dynamic roles such as 3D machine operators to material specialists working in partnership with local builders for carpentry, roofing, painting, and beyond. In addition to the school in Salima district, 14Trees also built its first 3DP prototype house in Lilongwe, Malawi, in just 12 hours, compared to almost four days using conventional methods.

{"id":7840,"text":"* Lightweight solution lowers embodied CO2 footprint by up to 80. * Low-carbon and circular benefits enhanced by Holcim’s green concrete, ECOPact Plus. * Industrial production as precast floor solution in developmen. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) and Holcim introduce today an innovative lightweight floor system with an 80 lower carbon footprint compared to traditional structures with no compromise on performance. The floor solution was designed by Block Research Group (BRG) of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) using the principles of strength through geometry. The sustainability profile of the floor solution is driven by its smart design, using 50 less materials, its green concrete with Holcim’s ECOPact Plus offering a 33 lower carbon footprint1 and its circularity profile using Holcim’s ECOPlanet green cement with 20 recycled construction and demolition waste inside. With traditional floor slabs in reinforced concrete accounting for 40 of the concrete mass of medium-rise buildings, the combination of smart design with green and circular building materials makes sustainable construction possible at scale. This breakthrough in sustainable floor construction is implemented for the first time in the HiLo (High Performance, Low Emissions) innovation unit at NEST (Next Evolution in Sustainable Building Technologies) in Dübendorf, Switzerland. Jan Jenisch, Holcim CEO: \"This innovative floor system represents a real breakthrough in sustainable construction. It is a great example of how our key levers to net-zero building add up to make a real difference, from green concrete, to smart design, all the way to circularity. What’s exciting is that all this innovation is to put to work in a floor system that can be deployed at scale. With today’s rise in population and urbanisation, we expect to be building ten billion square meters of floors each year to house two billion additional people in cities by 2050. I am committed to accelerating the deployment of such green building solutions to make our cities work for people and the planet.\" Philippe Block, co-director of the Block Research Group at ETH Zurich: \"When it comes to finding sustainable construction solutions, floor slabs are a key challenge. Arched and vaulted geometries offer truly disruptive savings by enabling the use of low-carbon materials in much lower volume than before.\" The floor system’s design eliminates the need for embedded steel reinforcement, making it easy to recycle. Building functionalities such as efficient hydronic heating and cooling systems can be seamlessly integrated. Holcim and BRG are currently developing the floor system into a precast solution, targeted to be available for industrialized construction in 2023.

As part of their partnership, Holcim and Bloomberg Media launched the \"Circular Cities Barometer\" to understand how cities are leading the shift to circular living for a sustainable future. The Barometer’s first findings were unveiled on April 27, 2022, at the Bloomberg Green Summit. Jan Jenisch, Holcim CEO: \"Circular economy is a key element to stay within our planet's boundaries and get serious about climate action. With our world’s rapid urbanization, cities are at the center of this shift from a linear ‘take-make-waste’ economy to a circular ‘reduce-reuse-recycle’ one. This Barometer, developed in partnership with Bloomberg Media, gives us unique insights into what the most innovative circular cities around the world are doing to accelerate this shift. I’m excited to learn about these best practices, so that we can all play our part to fast-track the transition to circular living.\" \"At our core, Bloomberg is data centric and solutions driven,\" said Lauren Kiel, General Manager for Bloomberg Green at Bloomberg Media. \"That's why we're pleased to be partnering with Holcim to bring attention to what makes cities around the world circular. We hope that by providing these insights it will help inspire other cities to take action to enable change.\" Methodology. Using a proprietary algorithm, the Circular Cities Barometer measures the transition of 25 cities from a linear to a circular economy representing all global regions. They were scored on a dozen circularity indicators measuring circular buildings, circular systems, circular living and circular leadership. Amsterdam The Netherlands Milan Italy.

Holcim is leading the way in circular construction, recycling over 50 million tons of materials across its business in 2021 on its way to doubling this rate to 100 million tons by 2030 as part of its net-zero roadmap. To make buildings work for people and the planet, Holcim applies the circular economy principle of \"reduce, reuse and recycle\" across its business:. * Reduce: To reduce the footprint of buildings, Holcim continuously advances its portfolio of green building solutions. One example is the green concrete ECOPact, with a carbon footprint ranging from 30% to 100% lower emissions than standard concrete. * Reuse: With 80% of Europe's building stock projected to still be in use by 2050, repairing and renovating buildings with green retrofit systems is a key priority. Holcim’s advanced roofing, waterproofing and insulation systems enhance the energy efficiency of buildings and extend their lifespan. * Recycle: Within the ECOPlanet range, Holcim launched the world’s first cement with 20% recycled construction & demolition waste inside. Another example comes from Holcim’s latest acquisition of Malarkey Roofing Products. Malarkey upcycles materials into roof shingles, including 3,200 plastic bags for an average residential home in the US.

I congratulate my teams for engineering such smart and scalable solutions and thank the EU for its shared interest in making them economically viable.\" Holcim offers its sector’s broadest range of low-carbon materials, from ECOPact green concrete to ECOPlanet green cement, offering 30% to 100% less CO2 emissions with no compromise in performance. These solutions are enabled by Holcim’s green product formulation expertise and use of innovative low emission raw materials, from calcined clay to construction & demolition waste. Holcim’s plants across the region currently operate with over 60% of eco-fuels, coming from the recycling of materials at the end of their lifecycle, from biomass to municipal waste. Its most advanced plants in this area are in Austria and the Czech Republic, operating with close to 100% eco-fuels. The European Union Innovation Fund is one of the world's largest funding programs for innovative low-carbon technologies. This year, the Fund is granting more than EUR 1.8 billion to 17 large-scale projects contributing to a low-carbon society, out of a pool of 138 submissions.","company_name":"LafargeHolcim","published_on":"2022-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Holcim selected for 2 EU Innovation Fund grants for Clean Tech projects decarbonizing Europe","emissions_rank":11,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"- EU Investments in Holcim Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage projects in Germany and Poland \n- Grants based on highly scalable technologies at the forefront of Europe’s decarbonization\n- Accelerating Holcim’s net-zero roadmap with 2030 and 2050 targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative ","article_url":"https:\/\/www.holcim.com\/media\/media-releases\/eu-innovation-fund","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.holcim.com\/sites\/holcim\/files\/2022-07\/20220718_press_holcim_eu_grants-ccus_en.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":7989,"text":"The Supervisory Board of PKN ORLEN has today agreed to put into a force a Management by Objectives programme (MBO), a new incentive scheme for the Management Board and managerial staff of PKN ORLEN.\n\nThe new scheme is one of the undertakings which is designed to support PKN ORLEN’s Value Creation Strategy and corporate culture. It is aimed at building a transparent and objective remuneration model. The MBO scheme is based on best international practice. \n\nIn the scheme, bonuses will be determined by the degree of execution of assignments. Both the senior management and key staff will be motivated to achieve their set objectives, which are derived from the strategic and financial plans. The objectives are first approved by the Supervisory Board for Management Board members, and then cascaded down to individual managers. This will guarantee the coherence of the entire management structure, which is a new element across the company. The new system includes an SVA parameter - a solidarity goal - which refers to all managers including the Management Board. \n\nThe bonus rate will be determined mainly by such measures as operating profit or improvements to the cost base. It will not depend upon an individual’s decision but will be translated directly from the extent of the realized goals as set out in the financial plan accepted by the Supervisory Board. The Board will also assess on an annual basis the degree of strategy implementation. \n\nPKN ORLEN wishes to emphasize that the MBO will not cause any rise in payments for Management Board members but is instead meant to increase the efficiency of resources paid out for bonuses.

{"id":8001,"text":"NEW COST OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM FOR PKN ORLEN AND THE CAPITAL GROUP\n\nPKN ORLEN launches the “OPTIMA” program, which aims to save a minimum of PLN 600 million in operational costs and to reduce investment costs by a further PLN 600 million by 2009. OPTIMA will apply to both the core operations of PKN ORLEN and the Capital Group. \n\nIgor Chalupec, President and CEO said: “Increasing cost and investment efficiency is one of the key elements of ORLEN’s strategy. Our plans are based on the best practices in the industry” \n\nUntil 2005 the Company will continue to implement the cost reduction program (KPRKO), initiated in 2003. The Company is on target to achieve the main goal of the program – fixed operational costs reduction amounting to PLN 800 million by the end of 2005. \n\nThe new program substantially widens a range of present savings initiatives. Apart from plans for the improvement of production and logistic efficiency, OPTIMA additionally focuses on cost efficiency in all business functions of the Company’s subsidiaries. Selected support functions of the Group’s key partnerships will be centralized through the creation of service centres. \n\nNearly half of the expected PLN 600 million savings will come from new areas, which until now were not included in the KPRKO program. About PLN 135 million of the savings will be generated in such subsidiaries as: Anwil, Rafineria Trzebinia, Rafineria Nafty Jedlicze, ORLEN Oil, ORLEN Asfalt and IKS Solino. At the same time, the level of savings will be increased through the implementation of OPTIMA to UNIPETROL. In production and logistics the expected reduction will reach PLN 125 million. \n\nSavings of approximately PLN 100 million are expected from the rationalization and centralization of purchases by PKN ORLEN and the Capital Group. Increased efficiency in support functions such as accountancy, key personnel, administration and IT are expected to generate an additional PLN 60 million in savings. \n\nChanges planned in the retail segment will substantially contribute to the overall cost reduction. PKN ORLEN aims to save about PLN 190 million as a result of a retail sales restructuring program, including reducing operating costs at fuel stations. \n\nThe program aims to reduce operational costs by PLN 250 million in the next year and a further PLN 420 million in the following year. Savings of PLN 540 million are planned by 2008 and a minimum of PLN 600 million by 2009. \n\nPKN ORLEN plans to make additional savings on investments, amounting to PLN 600 million by 2009. These plans are based on the full achievement of all investment projects by the Capital Group. The cost savings will be implemented in outlay optimization, centralization of purchases and investment services, planning rationalization together with implementation and verification of investment projects. \n\nAreas which may bring additional CAPEX savings between 2006 and 2009 are production, wholesale and logistics (PLN 310 million) and the Company’s subsidiaries (PLN 290 million). \n\nJan Maciejewicz, Vice President, Chief Cost and IT Manager said: “We estimate that in 2009 the total cost reduction, due to KPRKO realization and implementation of OPTIMA program, shall be a minimum of PLN 1.4 billion.”. \n\nPress Office  \nPKN ORLEN\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2005-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"New Cost Optimization Program","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"NEW COST OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM FOR PKN ORLEN AND THE CAPITAL GROUP  PKN ORLEN launches the “OPTIMA” program, which aims to save a minimum of PLN 600 million in operational costs and to reduce investment...","article_url":"https:\/\/a.orlen.pl\/EN\/PressOffice\/Pages\/NewCostOptimizationProgra.aspx","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":8007,"text":"PKN ORLEN presents financial results for 2Q 2005 \n\nIn the second quarter of this year the Capital Group of PKN ORLEN (excluding Unipetrol) achieved one of best net profit results in the Group’s history - PLN698 million. The return on average capital employed (ROACE) reached 14.4% and the EBIDTA was PLN 921 million. The program of operational cost reduction has brought savings of PLN 210 million, compared to PLN 163 million in the second quarter of 2004. As the result of an estimate of the risks resulting from agreements signed by the previous Management Board with Agrofert and ConocoPhilips, it was decided to create a reserve to cover the economic risk. Net profit without this reserve would have amounted to PLN 1,003 million while EBIDTA would be PLN 1,297 million.\n\nThe high price of oil was an important macroeconomic factor influencing the economic situation in the second quarter of this year. The difference in the price of oil in 2Q 2005 compared to 2Q 2004 amounted to almost 46%. At the same time, the Ural\/Brent differential reached USD 3.6\/bbl, higher than in 1Q 2004 by 16.1%. The refinery margin amounted to an average USD5.5\/bbl, equivalent to a fall of 7% compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year. \n\nThe Company achieved a net profit of PLN698 million, 9% higher than in 2Q 2004. The results were better for each segment. The operating profit in the refinery segment rose by 38.2% compared to 2Q 2004. This was as a result of the implementation of effective solutions and the high demand for fuel and chemical products. Despite stagnation in olefins installation there was a dynamic rise in profits in the petrochemical segment (higher by 43.4% compared to 2Q 2004) as a result of high profit margins for ethylene and propylene. The operating profit of ORLEN Deutschland amounted to PLN10 million, and this positively influenced the results of the retail segment, which reached PLN62 million. \n\nThe Company’s revenue in 2Q of this year amounted to PLN 8,400 million, 12% higher than in 2Q 2004. The most dynamic rise in revenues compared to 2Q 2004, of 26%, was registered in the refinery segment. In the period described the rate at which costs rose was slower than the rate at which incomes increased. \n\nIn the years 2003-2004 the previous PKN Orlen Management Board signed a series of agreements with Agrofert and ConocoPhilips. These agreements oblige PKN Orlen (among other things) to make all possible efforts to sell a part of Unipetrol’s assets to Agrofert Holding a.s. The agreements signed with Agrofert stipulate selling some assets of Unipetrol within the Unipetrol group which were not considered by the previous Management Board to be relevant to the activities of PKN Orlen. These assets were connected with agricultural production, plant protection measures and chemical products. The present Management Board emphasizes that there was no agreement signed between Unipetrol and Agrofert or ConocoPhilips which dealt with selling these assets. The agreement with ConocoPhillips also stipulates the selling by Unipetrol of up to 1\/3 of all Unipetrol- owned fuel stations with the sales price having been previously fixed in the agreements. These transactions would have to be made by PKN Orlen after achieving corporate control over Unipetrol. The fact of not fulfilling the commitments defined in these agreements exposes PKN Orlen to compensatory sanctions. Additionally, much of the information concerning these agreements is covered by confidentiality clauses, which stipulate significant compensatory sanctions for violation. \n\nThe present Management Board has ordered independent experts to analyze all the possible results of realizing the agreements signed by the previous Management Board. This has only become possible after taking corporate control over Unipetrol. The transactions relating to the purchase of Unipetrol Holding is controlled by the Monitoring and Safety Office of PKN ORLEN. The results of this work will be directed to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Agency of Public Safety and the Central Investigation Office. In July 2005 the present Management Board presented to the Supervisory Board its strategy for minimizing the negative results of the realization of these agreements for PKN Orlen and its shareholders. All possible, formal and juridical preparations have taken place in order to secure, in the most effective way, the interests of PKN ORLEN and its shareholders. \n\n“All the remedial actions of the present Management Board are in line with best practice, and transparency and ethics rules. They concentrate on the maximum protection of PKN ORLEN shareholder’s interests and of our investment in the Czech Republic” – stated Igor Chalupec, the President of the Management Board. \n\nDespite of the necessity of creating a reserve to cover the economic risk, the present Management Board is positive regarding PKN’s presence in the Czech market and the chance of gaining above-average returns from the investment made in Unipetrol. There is no reference between the agreement signed with National Treasure Fund of Czech Republic and the agreements signed with ConocoPhilips and Agrofert. \n\nThe Company has implemented a restructuring program which aims is to improve the effectiveness of the firm’s backup services, decentralize sales management and centralize the operational base of the Company. In July 2005 new regional structures began to function in the retail segment, investment and fuel station rebuilding segment, and in finance. At the end of July, this year, an agreement with the trade unions was signed closing the period of collective protest. \n\nFrom 1 of October 2005 the Basell Orlen Polyolefins (BOP) partnership will be responsible for the realization of sales of petrochemical products in Poland, while the second investor in BOP – the Basell partnership will take responsibility for selling the surplus. In October the new installations for Polyethylene HDPE and Polypropylene will begin operation. \n\nNumerous initiatives to improve the effectiveness of the ORLEN Group have been introduced during the last few months. In 2005, 8 partnerships were disinvested, other 9 were taken over or merged, and the disinvestment process of a further 9 firms has begun. In addition, an investigation concerning managers in the Group’s Partnerships was finalized by independent experts as well as during the assessment center. Based on their recommendations, changes in management were made in 14 partnerships, and in 17 others the changes will be made soon. Moreover, the segment responsibility for particular subjects was attributed to competent departments within PKN ORLEN. \n\nIn 2Q 2005 a new program for cost reduction, OPTIMA, was presented. Its aim is to gain by 2009 a minimum of PLN600 million in savings in operational costs, and investment will be reduced by a further PLN600 million. The previous program KPRO is still being implemented and, by the end of this year, it should result in PLN800 million savings in operational costs per year. After the end of 2Q 2005 the savings achieved of PLN426 million was equivalent to 53% of the program’s target for this year. Also, a new system of internet auctions sales was introduced, enabling negotiations on the basis of an internet platform. \n\nA new motivating program – “management by objectives” - for management personnel was also implemented in 2Q 2005. This program introduces a transparent and objective model for manager rewards. \n\nThe aim of PKN ORLEN is to become a regional leader. This is why PKN ORLEN implements projects on an international scale. The Management Board of PKN ORLEN has placed a tender offer for a 51% stake in Tupras (which owns 4 refineries in Turkey with a total processing capacity of ca. 27,6 million tonnes\/year). The privatization was announced by the Turkish government in the first half of 2005. A due diligence study of the Turkish group has been finished. The deadline for the placement of final offers is 2 September 2005. \n\nPress Office  \nPKN ORLEN\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2005-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"The ORLEN Group's performance in 2Q 2005","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":" PKN ORLEN presents financial results for 2Q 2005  In the second quarter of this year the Capital Group of PKN ORLEN (excluding Unipetrol) achieved one of best net profit results in the Group’s history...","article_url":"https:\/\/a.orlen.pl\/EN\/PressOffice\/Pages\/TheORLENGroupsperformance.aspx","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":8031,"text":"Doubled olefin capacity in Plock – PKN ORLEN has completed its biggest petrochemical investment \n\nToday PKN ORLEN officially completed the Olefin II revamping, an investment which has allowed the company to double its ethylene and propylene streams – key feedstocks for the production of plastics. The modernized plants are capable of producing up to 700,000 tonnes of ethylene and up to 385,000 tonnes of propylene per annum. The bulk of the output will be streamed to the new plants of Basell Orlen Polyolefins and Anwil Wloclawek. \n\nIn addition to increased production volume, the revamped Olefin II plant will play a fundamental role in capturing synergies with the refinery through enabling even better flexibility in consuming petrol and diesel. \n\n\"The enhancement of the petrochemical segment strengthens the economic position of PKN ORLEN, both in Poland and the region. Together with the petrochemical operations of Unipetrol, we have a chance to play a significant role in the European sector\" – said Igor Chalupec, President & CEO of PKN ORLEN. \n\nPKN ORLEN’s forecast of growing demand for olefin products and the related investment plans of ORLEN Group companies prompted the investment decision. It was initiated as early as 2000, and the negotiations ended two years later with the awarding of a EUR 245m contract with ABB LGG, general contractor, which was completed today. \n\nCurrent demand has appeared to be even bigger than forecast, and the doubled olefin volume has already been 100 per cent allocated to customers. The bulk of production will be directed to the new production complex of Basell Orlen Polyolefins. The second biggest off-taker will be Anwil Wloclawek, which two years ago completed its own revamping of its PVC production facilities. The remaining volumes will be consumed by external customers. \n\nThe Olefin II plant is a key facility of the petrochemical complex in Plock. It was constructed in 1977-1980 based on Lummus technology. Initially, the plant capacity equaled 300,000 tonnes of ethylene and 125,000 tonnes of propylene per annum. Between 1994-1995 the plant was revamped and annual volumes increased to 360,000 tonnes of ethylene and 135,000 tonnes of propylene. At the same time plant energy consumption decreased by some 25 per cent. The revamping of the Olefin II plant has marked the end of the Olefin I plant, which was constructed in 1971. \n\nIn 2000 the Company decided to further develop its petrochemical operations. The modernisation of the existing plant turned out to be the best solution for increasing volumes – both the investment costs as well as the savings resulting from utilizing the existing infrastructure, supply, utility and media facilities were in favour of revamping. \n\nThe latest investment translates into increased annual ethylene volumes, from 360,000 to 700,000 tpa, and propylene from 135,000 to 380,000 tpa. Taking into account the propylene streams from the catalytic cracker, PKN ORLEN is capable of producing 485,000 tonnes of propylene per annum. \n\n\"In order to properly capture the significant domestic growth potential in olefin consumption, we are considering the construction of an Olefin III plant. This would be an efficient way of utilizing the larger petrol volumes of that are expected, due to the forecast increase in demand for diesel\" – said Czeslaw Bugaj, Deputy CEO, Chief Operation Officer. \n\nPress Office  \nPKN ORLEN\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2005-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ORLEN completed its biggest petrochemical investment","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"Doubled olefin capacity in Plock – PKN ORLEN has completed its biggest petrochemical investment  Today PKN ORLEN officially completed the Olefin II revamping, an investment which has allowed the...","article_url":"https:\/\/a.orlen.pl\/EN\/PressOffice\/Pages\/ORLENcompleteditsbiggestp.aspx","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":8043,"text":"PKN ORLEN has ranked among Poland’s leading companies for its compliance with corporate governance. In the rankings published by Polskie Forum Corporate Governance (www.pfcg.org.pl) PKN ORLEN received an A note rating, which proves the scope of quality changes introduced to the Company. In January 2005 PKN ORLEN adopted all corporate governance principles recommended by the Warsaw Stock Exchange. PKN ORLEN’s high ranking reflects the high assessment from analysts and investors of PKN ORLEN’s engagement in implementation of corporate governance principles.\n\nThe change in investor and client perceptions of PKN ORLEN is a result of our efforts to follow the corporate governance principles. The introduction of three independent members to the Supervisor Board, establishment of an Audit Committee and Corporate Governance Committee are just a few undertakings which have positively influenced the perceptions of PKN ORLEN.\n\nIn the WarsawScan 2005 survey, which assessed the quality of PKN ORLEN’s co-operation with its shareholders and analysts pointed at PKN ORLEN as a the best company in the IR field. Igor Chalupec, the President & CEO of PKN ORLEN, was ranked the second most highly valued President (after CEO of Agora) for strategy building, company development and excellent communication skills. \n\nThe aim of the 3rd publication of the corporate governance rankings is to provide investors with fundamental information on the quality of the corporate governance abidance within the 55 surveyed companies. The survey assessed the provisions regarding the practices of the Supervisory Board, General Meetings, audit and Company’s information policy. The experts also evaluated the way the corporate governance principles are put into effect across the companies. The overall progress of Polish companies appears positive with 15 companies improving from last year and only 7 deteriorating. \n\nThe fact that PKN ORLEN ranked within top 13 companies in respect of corporate governance proves the effectiveness of the work undertaken. In the analysts’ opinions, the companies which follow the principles can expect the better performance of their securities. In Poland the premium on a company that complies with the principles of corporate governance has reached 23%. Currently, PKN ORLEN does its best to even improve transparency and efficiency of its operations as well as to enhance positive perception of PKN ORLEN.

{"id":8049,"text":"PKN ORLEN PURCHASES SHARES OF POLKOMTEL\n\nPKN ORLEN together with three other Polish companies has signed an agreement concerning the purchase of Polkomtel’s shares, which are now owned by TDC Mobile International. After the agreement is executed total share of Polish companies in Polkomtel SA will rise from 61% to 75%. Signing the agreement will support further implementation of the announced withdrawal from investments in Polkomtel’s shares announced PKN ORLEN. \n\nThe agreement concerning a purchase of 19,6% shares of Polkomtel from a Danish company TDC Mobile International was signed by four Polish partnerships: KGHM Polska Miedź SA, PKN ORLEN, PSE SA and Weglokoks SA. Also British Vodafone was interested in further investment in Polkomtel’s shares. \n\nPursuant on the agreement, PKN ORLEN may acquire 980,486 shares in Polkomtel SA, for a purchase price not exceeding EUR 214.04 per share. This amount represents approximately 4.78% of the share capital of Polkomtel SA, but together with the company’s shares owned by other agreement parties, the total share of Polish companies in Polkomtel will exceed a threshold of 75%.\n\n\\- As we announced before, we are pretty much interested in such way of withdrawal from our investment in Polkomtel, that would be most profitable to the company. In the face of the offer of TDC we had to react effectively. A purchase of shares from TDC is an integral element of our strategy, according to which we plan to withdraw all our shares from Polkomtel SA. Referring to this strategy it is important to secure the business of our investors in Polkomtel in the period preceding the sale of shares – said Vice-President of PKN ORLEN Cezary Smorszczewski. \n\nThe agreement concerning the purchase of Polkomtel’s shares from TDC Mobile International S\/A has been executed subject to the following condition precedent: the expiry of the injunction prohibiting a transfer of shares in Polkomtel SA covered by the agreement by TDC. This means that the agreement shall terminate in the case there are any obstacles violating the purchase of shares due to the conflict between TDC Mobile International and Vodafone by 10 March 2009. \n\nThe parties agreed to vote together in favor of dividends distributed to the shareholders. This concerns as well the retained net profits for years preceding 2005, as 100% net profit of Polkomtel SA generated for years 2005 and 2006 and at least 50% of the net profit generated for any subsequent financial year. \n\nWhile making their decision about the shares purchase the investors have also accepted the operational schedule in the case of problems with the way the company is managed. According to the agreement, if no common procedures concerning the management in Polkomtel are established within this year, it would mean that the parties agree on floating the purchased shares of Polkomtel. \n\nPress Office  \nPKN ORLEN \n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2006-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","title":"PKN ORLEN purchases shares of Polkomtel","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"PKN ORLEN PURCHASES SHARES OF POLKOMTEL PKN ORLEN together with three other Polish companies has signed an agreement concerning the purchase of Polkomtel’s shares, which are now owned by TDC Mobile...","article_url":"https:\/\/a.orlen.pl\/EN\/PressOffice\/Pages\/PKNORLENpurchasessharesof.aspx","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":8055,"text":"From June 30 to July 8, Karlovy Vary is hosting its well known film festival. This is the most important Category A international film festival in Central and Eastern Europe, and the only Category A festival in the Czech Republic. The Karlovy Vary IFF is open to the public and is visited by thousands of people every year. More than 200 new films from around the world are presented annually. The partners of this year’s film festival will be PKN ORLEN and Unipetrol, both members of the ORLEN Group – a major regional oil company.  \n  \nThe Karlovy Vary IFF is one of the oldest film festivals (the first took place in 1946). Each year the festival attracts thousands of visitors, especially young people. The festival is also very popular with celebrities, so every year big stars from both European and Hollywood cinematography are present at the festival.  \n  \nUnipetrol has a long tradition of supporting the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. The cooperation started in 2000 and, because it was a highly satisfactory experience for both sides, it continued on two more occasions, in 2001 and 2005. This year, Unipetrol is brought in its major shareholder, PKN ORLEN, as another sponsor of the event.  \n  \nSince PKN ORLEN entered the Czech market after acquiring a majority stake in Unipetrol, PKN ORLEN has wanted to support not only Polish culture and art but also some of the major cultural events held in the Czech Republic. Its desire to sponsor European culture follows from the Group’s position as a leading player in the European economies, and reflects a Group with the major values of European culture incorporated into its mission and strategy. This consideration will determine PKN ORLEN´s further activities in the new economic environment, as the burden for supporting artistic activities will fall upon big and financially strong organizations, such as PKN ORLEN and Unipetrol, who feel a responsibility for the destiny and development of national cultures.  \n  \nRealizing its mission as a Patron of Culture, PKN ORLEN has given support to a range of events. The most recent cultural project held in Czech Republic was PKN ORLEN’s partnership of the Charles IV – Emperor by the Grace of God Exhibition at Prague Castle, which became the Czech cultural event of the year. In 2004 PKN ORLEN was the partner of the “Ostře sledované filmy festival (Closely Watched Movies)” which presented Czech and Slovak films from the golden era of the 60´s and 70´s. The festival was under the patronage of former president Václav Havel. The company also co-financed the purchase of the precious manuscript of Fryderyk Chopin in 2004 and sponsored the XV International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition in 2005. For the last few years PKN ORLEN has been the patron of the National Museum in Warsaw, which owns the biggest and most precious collections of art in Poland. PKN ORLEN also supported the renovation of Gdańsk Old Town and restored the medieval prints of the Diocese Museum in Płock, just to name a few other projects.  \n  \nUnipetrol´s sponsorship of cultural events can be seen in projects such as Struny podzimu (Strings of Autumn) - a cycle of prestigious concerts of both classical and modern music, its support for the publication of Arnošt Lustig´s book Krásné zelené oči (Pretty Green Eyes), financing exhibits for the National Gallery, supporting the NKL Žofín agency which organizes concerts both in the Czech Republic and abroad, and sponsoring Helena Vondráčková´s mega-party to celebrate 40 years in show business, to name but a few.   \n  \nAbout PKN ORLEN:  \n  \nPKN ORLEN is Central Europe’s biggest oil company, with its headquarters in Poland. With an income of EUR9bn in 2005, the Group emerged as the largest company in the group of new EU accession states. As such, PKN ORLEN is aiming for a major role in the regional consolidation of the oil industry in Central Europe. With this intention, the company last year bought 63% of petrochemical holding Unipetrol for EUR434mn (CZK13bn) from the Czech state. PKN ORLEN operates over 2,700 petrol stations in Europe – directly or through subsidiaries – and owns the refinery at Płock in Poland, which is one of the most efficient and modern refineries in Europe. PKN ORLEN’s shares are traded on the Warsaw and London stock exchanges. The ORLEN Capital Group includes some 80 subsidiaries and employs over 14,000 people. About Unipetrol:  \n  \nUnipetrol consists of a group of companies operating in the chemical sector in the Czech Republic. Group companies are primarily engaged in crude oil processing, fuel distribution, and the production of petrochemicals and fertiliser. In all of these fields, Unipetrol is a major representative of each industrial sector in the Czech Republic and in Central Europe. In accordance with the original concept, the Czech State’s share was privatized on June 4th, 2004, when the representatives of the National Property Fund and PKN ORLEN signed the contract regarding the sale of shares of UNIPETROL, a.s. In May 2005 the share of the National Property Fund was transferred into the hands of PKN ORLEN. This has resulted in a the regional consolidation of Central European companies with the aim of becoming a competitive player in the global market.\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2006-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","title":"PKN ORLEN and UNIPETROL - partners of the 41","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"From June 30 to July 8, Karlovy Vary is hosting its well known film festival.

The Polish stock exchange is currently one of the region's biggest and a known player on the European market. To a large extent we owe those achievements to Mr. Wiesław Rozłucki. His professional experience, commitment to development of Polish capital markets, including active participation in the development and implementation of the Polish set of rules of corporate governance (Good Practices in Public Companies), and an ongoing improvement programme allow one to state that this candidate not only gives full guarantees of fulfilling the responsibilities of an independent member of the supervisory board, but also one that can bring great added value to PKN ORLEN S.A itself.\"   \n  \nIn addition, ING Nationale-Nederlanden proposes: \"In line with the articles of association of PKN ORLEN S.A., the supervisory board may be composed of up to nine persons, including one representative of the Minister of the Treasury.

(.) We think that also in this respect PKN ORLEN S.A. should set the standards on the Polish capital market.\"    \n  \nIn the opinion of ING Nationale-Nederlanden: \"It must be stressed that that PKN ORLEN S.A is already today an international and not exclusively Polish company. This is important insofar that the supervisory board faces greater challenges. Therefore, proper selection of the competencies of the board members, their professionalism and positive image on international scale are becoming ever more important.

For this reason, PKN ORLEN may not currently participate in any efforts undertaken by MN with a view to securing oil deliveries to the refinery, however, to the best of PKN ORLEN’s knowledge, such efforts are on a successful path. When preparing its bid, PKN ORLEN conducted thorough economic analyses taking into account the costs of deliveries of various types of oil by sea. According to PKN ORLEN’s estimates, oil refining at MN is profitable even in a scenario assuming exclusive deliveries by sea. \n\nAs regards the present situation, PKN ORLEN wishes to express its hope that there are not any non-business related reasons behind the reported pipeline failure. If that were the case, Russia could not be perceived as a trustworthy supplier of energy resources. PKN ORLEN is deeply convinced that Transneft will soon remove the pipeline failure and resume oil deliveries via the pipeline. Any prolonged interruption of pipeline deliveries might result in Transneft’s loss of its reputation as a reliable partner.   \n  \nThe acquisition price of MN, specified in the agreements concluded with Yukos International UK BV and the Lithuanian government, is a fixed price and may be reduced only in the event of payment of dividends from the 2005 profit to the existing shareholders. \n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2006-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Press Release Re.

{"id":8103,"text":"Vilnius, 15.12.2006   \nBIGGEST TRANSACTION IN THE HISTORY OF THE POLISH ECONOMY– AB MAŽEIKŲ NAFTA JOINS GRUPA ORLEN \n\nToday PKN ORLEN finalized the acquisition of a strategic stake in the Lithuanian company AB Mažeikių Nafta (MN). The Polish corporation acquired a total of 84.36% shares from Yukos International UK B.V. (Yukos) and the Lithuanian Government, paying $ 2.34 billion. PKN ORLEN has taken corporate control over the Lithuanian refinery by changing the composition of its Supervisory and Management Boards. \n\nThe biggest transaction in the history of the Polish economy crowns the consistent implementation of PKN ORLEN’s 2005 – 2009 strategy, which provides for various value-building activities, including acquisitions in the region. The inclusion of AB Mažeikių Nafta (MN) in Grupa ORLEN creates the largest oil corporation in Central Europe with crude oil processing capacity totaling a regional record of 31.7 m tons per year. \n\nYesterday PKN ORLEN issued to the Vilnius branch of SEB - Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken an irrevocable transfer order to Yukos International UK B.V. Today Yukos transferred shares in MN to the account of PKN ORLEN and the two entities signed an agreement finalizing the transaction. \n\nAlso today PKN ORLEN concluded its transaction with the Lithuanian government - transferring payment, receiving shares and signing an agreement between the Polish corporation and its partners representing the Lithuanian government. \n\nConcurrently with the conclusion of the transaction, PKN ORLEN submitted an application to the Lithuanian Securities and Exchange Commission to approve the documents in connection with the MTO on the remaining 5.64% of the floating shares in MN. Approval of the MTO by the appropriate authorities (securities commissions) is expected late in December 2006, and the share buyout process should start on January 4, 2007. The MTO process is expected to close by January 17, 2007. \n\nThe new Supervisory Board additionally appointed Igor Chalupec, President & CEO of PKN ORLEN and Piotr Kownacki, Vice President of PKN ORLEN in charge of Audit & Regulations to the Management Board of AB Mažeikių Nafta. During its first meeting the Management Board of MN appointed Igor Chalupec to the position of President & CEO of MN. As informed earlier, the competences of the Management Board of MN are focused on strategic decisions (in a similar way to a Supervisory Board under Polish legislation). At present, the Management Board of MN consists of 7 members, including 6 proposed by PKN ORLEN S.A. and one by the Government of Lithuania. \n\nUnder Lithuanian law, persons sitting on the Management Board of a parent company may not be members of the Supervisory Board of a subsidiary. They may, however, sit on the Management Board of the company. This is due to differences in the role of the Management Board within the company’s corporate governance as compared to their Polish counterparts. The majority of the day-to-day operating management is handled by the Chief Executive Officer, whereas the competencies of the Management Board are directed towards strategic decisions (in a similar way to a Supervisory Board under Polish legislation). \n\nIn accordance with policies implemented two years ago by the PKN ORLEN Group, persons delegated by PKN ORLEN to the Supervisory Board and the Management Board of AB Mažeikių Nafta will relinquish all remuneration for their work on the statutory bodies of the company. The process of structural integration of the AB Mažeikių Nafta refinery will be significantly accelerated, because of PKN ORLEN’s prior experience in acquiring the Czech-based UNIPETROL holding.

The execution of the contract is the result of a tender process lasting almost one year, in which 11 investors participated.\n\nPrague, 30th January 2007 - The decision regarding the disposal of Kaučuk shares was made in accordance with the new UNIPETROL strategy, publicly announced in Autumn 2005, as well as with the Main Strategic Objectives and Key Targets Within Long-Term Activity Plan in UNIPETROL presented at the Shareholders’ General Meeting in April 2006. Following the corporate strategy, the company focuses on its core activities, namely refining, petrochemicals and fuel retail, and will continue to do so. From this perspective, Kaučuk represents a second tier business. What also played a role in the decision-making process to follow with the divestment was the fact that Kaučuk´s scale of operations and product portfolio, as compared to its European peers, does not allow for competitive advantages and does not optimize the value of the company on a stand-alone basis. Disposing of the company to a strategic investor allows UNIPETROL to maximize the value from the future business relations with Kaučuk by sharing the synergies which the new investor. The proceeds obtained from the sale of Kaučuk will enable UNIPETROL to invest more in its core businesses and to further restructure the debt within the whole group. “We prefer to be the top player in a few segments than to be an average player in many”, said François Vleugels, CEO of UNIPETROL. \n\nTo achieve the best result possible and to maximize the value for UNIPETROL and its shareholders it was essential to run the tender in line with the best standards and practices followed in similar M&A transactions. “Similar to the sale of Spolana, the whole divestment process as well as the terms of the transaction were negotiated in consultation with and checked by independent experts”, said Dariusz Marzec, CIO of UNIPETROL. “Everything was also under the close scrutiny of the Supervisory Board”, he added. \n\nThe Board of Directors of UNIPETROL has applied the rule of transparency in the divestment process with regular monitoring by the Supervisory Board and its respective committees. The transaction was subject to approvals by corporate bodies of UNIPETROL, which approvals were granted prior to the completion of the sale process. \n\nIn February 2006, thirty-two investors identified as potentially interested in the acquisition of Kaučuk were invited to participate in the tender. Eleven investors, which expressed their interest, were at the next stage provided with the Information Memorandum. Measures assuring the maximum objectivity were adopted in the process. Selection of the bidders to the next stages of the process was always based on the pre-defined and professional set of evaluation criteria which were established in cooperation with external advisors. \n\nIn properly protecting UNIPETROL and its shareholders, the priority of UNIPETROL’s Board of Directors, the evaluation was based on maximization of proceeds from the transaction on the one hand and optimization of an on-going business relationship between Kaučuk and the rest of UNIPETROL Group on the other. \n\nPrior to submission of the bids, the following criteria for the evaluation of initial offers were defined:   \n• financial parameters of the offer;   \n• investor’s intent\/approach towards creation of a joint venture with UNIPETROL;   \n• proposed development program (including intent towards a further company’s development and the role it would play in the bidder’s capital group\/investment portfolio, planned production of monomers, polystyrenes as well as elastomers, intended capex); and   \n• bidders’ credibility. \n\nIn May 2006, seven initial offers were submitted by both industrial and financial investors. The offers were of an indicative kind and, as such, subject to later due diligence findings. Three investors, whose offers were ranked highest in the evaluation process, were allowed to conduct a due diligence review in Kaučuk which took place between 5th and 16th June 2006, with additional management sessions held on 19th and 20th June 2006. On 3rd July 2006, UNIPETROL received three post due diligence offers, which were consequently evaluated towards the criteria consistent with those adopted in the previous stage of the tender. As a result of the evaluation, the offer submitted by Dwory was selected as the best offer. On 11th July 2006, UNIPETROL decided to commence exclusive negotiations with Dwory. \n\n“Dwory is an investor who is able to add value to Kaučuk and bring its expertise and professional experience to the company”, said François Vleugels. Dwory turned out to be the investor, compared to other bidders, who will be best able to share with UNIPETROL the synergies from the acquisition of Kaučuk. This is mainly due to geographical, market and capital conditions. \n\nAn important justification for the purchase price, as well as for the other terms negotiated between UNIPETROL and Dwory, were the expert opinions presented by independent external advisors. Komerční banka, which was the leading financial advisor in the process, prepared a market value assessment which was afterwards reconfirmed by VOX Consult. Further, reputable international firm Deloitte, after having analyzed the terms and conditions of the transaction, concluded that the consideration to be paid by the investor for Kaučuk shares is fair from the financial point of view. Last but not least, VOX Consult prepared the review of all tender procedures and documentation with the conclusion that the tender had been conducted in line with the standards and practices applicable for similar M&A transactions. The valuations provided by the three experts ranged between CZK 3.4 and CZK 5.4 billion, with the valuation for the purposes of fairness opinion at the level of CZK 4.2 – 4.6 billion. \n\nBesides the purchase price, other important conditions were agreed. Dwory, as the future owner of Kaučuk, have to ensure, among others:   \n· undisturbed operations of the butadiene extraction unit as the essential element of the chain: steam cracker – butadiene extraction unit – refinery;   \n· creation of a joint-venture between UNIPETROL Group (51%) and Kaučuk (49%) concerning the construction and operation of a new butadiene extraction unit,   \n· processing of C4 from Chemopetrol and sales of Raffinate 1 to UNIPETROL Rafinérie;   \n· continuation of ethylene and benzene off-takes from Chemopetrol and future operation of ethylbenzene unit by Kaučuk;   \n· supplies of energy, steam, water and site services by Kaučuk to Česká rafinerská;   \n· continuation of all major contracts with UNIPETROL Group companies;   \n· allocation of the parties’ obligations resulting from any impact Kaučuk has had or might have in the future on the environment;   \n· future operation of energy unit by Kaučuk; and   \n· cooperation on activities allowing for future transfer of the land owned by UNIPETROL on which Kaučuk operates (to be carried out after transaction closing). \n\nThe contract also addresses the fine imposed, jointly and severally, on Kaučuk and UNIPETROL by the European Commission for participating in an alleged cartel aimed at prices fixing and sharing of customers for certain types of synthetic rubber (it relates to the period of 1999-2002). Although both companies strongly defended their positions before the European Commission, the fine of EUR 17.55 million was imposed. UNIPETROL and Kaučuk agreed to split the amount equally (50% each) pursuant to applicable Czech law since the European Commission’s decision does not specify any other split of the penalty. In addition, the following risk division mechanism has been agreed in case the final decision regarding the fine results in a change of the fine and\/or its split between Unipetrol and Kaučuk:   \n· a possible decrease of purchase price if, under the final decision, (i) the fine to be paid by Kaučuk is higher than Kaučuk’s 50% of the current fine and (ii) UNIPETROL is returned the amount from the European Commission – the maximum potential exposure of UNIPETROL is limited to EUR 5 million, and   \n· a possible increase of the purchase price primarily in case of any loss that UNIPETROL might incur as a result of any third party claims relating to facts investigated by the European Commission.\n\nUnipetrol and Dwory also agreed on a possible adjustment of the purchase price as a result of claims asserted by any governmental authority or private third party in connection with environmental conditions caused by Kaučuk (the adjustment is limited by 10% of the purchase price and may be claimed only within a period of 5 years from the closing of the transaction).   \n  \nAlthough signed today, the closing of the transaction (i.e., settlement of the purchase price in exchange for Kaučuk shares) is subject to several conditions precedent to be fulfilled by both Dwory and UNIPETROL. Among them, there are necessary clearances by relevant antimonopoly authorities, performance of an environmental audit to identify all existing environmental conditions on the land used by Kaučuk and the execution of commercial contracts based on the already agreed principles assuring further smooth functioning of UNIPETROL Group. The satisfaction of these conditions may influence the closing to occur within approximately two to three quarters from now on. \n\nFor more information, please visit www.UNIPETROL.cz\n\nUNIPETROL is a group of companies operating in the oil and petrochemical industry in the Czech Republic.

{"id":8145,"text":"Vilnius, 29.11.2007.   \nTHE ORLEN BRAND ENTERS THE LITHUANIAN AND LATVIAN MARKETS \n\nLaunching 120 owned-stations, gaining a 20% share in the consolidated Lithuanian-Latvian markets and launching the ORLEN Lietuva and ORLEN Latvija brands are the three pillars of PKN ORLEN’s retail strategy in the Baltic states. The premium brand will come with enhanced quality VERVA fuels, new standards in non-fuel products, and hospitality. \n\nPKN ORLEN has set ambitious goals for its retail strategy in Lithuania and Latvia. The company is planning to become the regional leader while ensuring long-term value growth and financial efficiency. \n\nNEW STATION CHAIN\n\nBuilding the retail chain in Lithuania and Latvia will be achieved in three phases which, over a five-year perspective, will enable the company to gain a 20% share in the consolidated markets of the two countries. \n\nIn the pilot phase to the end of 2008, PKN ORLEN will focus on acquiring selected stations or station chains and preparing for construction investments. In the second phase, planned for 2009-2010, the company will continue the acquisition process, but the focus will be on launching newly-built stations. The final phase will be dedicated to strengthening the chain's position in the Baltic markets and finalizing its construction plans. The schedule assumes that, by 2012, the company will have acquired approximately 20 stations in Lithuania and 25 in Latvia. During this time, the joint Lithuanian-Latvian market will see 75 newly-built stations. Throughout the acquisition and construction process, the company will also continue to develop its franchise system. Under this, the company is planning to sign 75 contracts with external partners by 2012. Upon completion of these plans the company will be operating a network of approximately 230 stations in the Baltic region and achieve its planned 20% share in the Lithuanian-Latvian markets. \n\nNEW BRAND\n\nThe specifics of the Lithuanian and Latvian markets, as well as consumer expectations expressed in market studies, have indicated the need to introduce one service station brand, unlike the Polish, Czech and German markets, where the respective PKN ORLEN chains are operated on the basis of two brands - a premium and an economy offering. In the Baltic states, the chain will be represented by the premium standard, expressed as the ORLEN name followed by the name of the country, i.e. ORLEN Lietuva and ORLEN Latvija. These brands will be positioned as \"high quality at an affordable price”. \n\nThe ORLEN Lietuva brand will be introduced first, replacing the existing Ventus brand. This decision is the result of market studies which indicate that the ORLEN brand is accepted and trusted by Lithuanian customers. It is associated with a guarantee of high quality products and services. The 34 existing Ventus stations will be rebranded. \n\nINNOVATIVE OFFERING\n\nAll stations comprising the ORLEN Lietuva chain will offer a new fuel standard – unleaded 95 and 98 petrol and diesel. The key element in the offering will be the differentiated Verva fuels, which represent supreme quality and advanced technology. ORLEN Lietuva stations will carry Verva 95 petrol and Verva Diesel. After two years of presence in Poland, VERVA is the most recognizable premium fuel brand, ahead of brands such as V-Power, Ultimate or Suprema. \n\nStores offering nonfuel products will be located in the majority of ORLEN Lietuva stations (95% - 100%) and will be presented in a new, customer friendly format. The chain will also carry an innovative food offering represented by the “stop cafe BISTRO” brand. \n\nPress Office   \nPKN ORLEN\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2007-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"The ORLEN brand enters the Lithuanian and Latvian markets.","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"Vilnius, 29.11.2007.

{"id":8187,"text":"The Group's 2008 financial results were affected by negative macroeconomic circumstances in Q4. A reversal of the trend of rising oil prices cut the reported operating profit by approx. PLN 2.7bn, whereas fluctuating f\/x rates negatively impacted reported financial costs by over PLN 1.5bn. However, please note that the evaluation of stocks and f\/x differences influenced the reported result predominantly from an accounting, not cash, perspective.  \n  \nNevertheless, in the difficult economic environment faced throughout the entire year, the Company managed to display good operating efficiency. Orlen's consistent approach to implementing its strategy boosted the Group's revenues by 25% y\/o\/y, and led to an optimisation of operating costs. Oil processing grew by 22% y\/o\/y, while retail and wholesale went up by 13% and 22%, respectively.  \n  \nReported results  \n  \nPKN ORLEN reports 2008 operating profit of PLN 758m, despite the very unfavourable stock valuation effect. Increased volumes and sale of non-fuel products significantly boosted operating profit in the retail segment: up by 48% to PLN 625m. Refinery's poor results are due to the unfavourable valuation of stocks. Petrochemical results worsened mainly because of reduced sales volumes of olefins and reduced margins on polyolefins. Improved margins boosted the result in the chemical segment by 16%.  \n  \nPKN ORLEN's 2008 sales growth dynamics were significantly above market growth. Sales volumes were up by 16%. Oil processing increased by 22%, while the production of high-yield medium distillations went up by 26%.  \n  \nIn 2008, PKN ORLEN Group reported revenues of PLN 79.5bn, i.e. up by 25% y\/o\/y. PKN ORLEN's operating profit before EBITDA amounted to PLN 3.24bn. The Group reported a consolidated net loss (- PLN 632m).  \n  \nWith the changing f\/x rates, it was necessary to revalue foreign currency denominated credits that are a natural security against unstable operating results caused by the PLN f\/x rate. It must be emphasised that the Group adopted and followed a conservative financial policy, and its portfolio never included speculative instruments, e.g. currency options. \n\nResults under LIFO  \n  \nUnder the LIFO stocks valuation method, current output is valued at the current cost of purchased oil. The LIFO method reflects the Company's actual operating efficiency as it excludes any items beyond its control.  \n  \nCompared to 2007, EBITDA was up by 32%, from PLN 3.86bn to PLN 5.09bn. 2008 EBIT operating profit totalled PLN 2.6bn, i.e. up by 81% y\/o\/y. The 2008 net profit was PLN 884m, i.e. down by 43% y\/o\/y. Cash Flow from operating activities surged by over PLN 1.6bn in 2008 y\/o\/y.  \n  \nStrategy followed  \n  \nAs planned, in 2008 the group followed the assumptions aimed at boosting fuel production and sales, especially diesel oil, as well as increasing retail sales of goods and services. Despite the unstable 2008 macroeconomic conditions, the Group has been implementing the key projects under its long-term strategic plan. The results will positively influence the company's future results. Last year's capital expenditure totalled PLN 3.9bn.  \n  \nImplementation of main projects in 2008\n\n  * Refinery: development of Diesel oil hydrodesulphurisation (HON) VII and Sulphur Plant in Płock; launch of Diesel oil production plant (HONH1) in Płock; completed reconstruction and launch of a vacuum pressure unit at Mazeikiu Nafta\n  * Petrochemicals: development of p-Xylene and Terephthalic acid production facility, development of benzene extraction and C5 fraction production facility in the Unipetrol Group\n  * Retail: 71 petrol stations launched (31 franchised); 225 petrol stations modernised, rebranded and reconstructed.\n\n\n\n2009 strategic plans  \n  \nPKN ORLEN will continue implementing the strategy announced at the end of last year. Due to the challenging global economic situation, the company will seek optimisation opportunities in capital expenditure and operating costs, and savings in all activities in order to maintain the proper level of indicators. The 'waiting list' will now include the investment projects that have not yet been launched or that are not a priority during the downturn.  \n  \nThe Group's key investments will continue though. Activities in the refinery segment will be focused on the 2009 launch of a new Diesel oil hydrodesulphurisation (HON) facility in Płock.  \n  \nIn 2009, the retail segment's objective will be to improve the sales volume per petrol station ratio, to maintain the growth of non-fuel margins, and to cut the costs of stations and marketing. Scheduled activities include: continued upgrade and optimisation of petrol stations, broadening the range of the non-fuel offer, and improved cost efficiency.  \n  \nIn the petrochemical industry, the two flagship investments will be continued: P-Xylene (PX) and Terephthalic acid (PTA) plants. A new Butadiene facility will be developed at Unipetrol in the Czech Republic, with a capacity of 120kT\/year. Chemical facilities will be regularly upgraded and extended to secure the growing competitive edge of Anwil and to maintain the attractiveness of those assets for future investors.   \nThe Company plans to continue with the sale of its shares in Polkomtel S.A. and to prepare for the sale of ZA Anwil SA.  \n  \nPress Office\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2009-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","title":"PKN ORLEN - 2008 consolidated financial results","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"The Group's 2008 financial  results were affected by negative macroeconomic circumstances in Q4.

{"id":8193,"text":"The electronic document circulation system, introduced by PKN ORLEN last year, was recognised as an exemplary and highly valuable practice by the Responsible Business Forum. The solution implemented by the Company was noted in the Forum's annual report as an example of \"Responsible Business in Poland\".\n\nIt is already the seventh publication of good practices reported by the Responsible Business Forum. This year's edition includes 88 of the most interesting corporate practices in four areas: workplace, market, society and natural environment. \n\nThis year, the Forum received a record-breaking number of over 150 good practices, which allowed it to choose the most valuable and exemplary ones. The system introduced at PKN ORLEN received a reward in the category \"Environment\" and deals with the principles of electronic circulation of documents within the business . \n\nGetting rid of hard copies of documents and speeding up the internal contract approval procedures is possible due to electronic systems. The practices implemented, reduced the amount of paper used in this Płock-based company by app. 4%. Another example of such practices is a project called SOWA , operated in the Capital Group, which concentrates on an electronic circulation of invoices and other accounting documents. \n\nWith the use of computer carriers in the company still growing, business processes become optimised and the corporation operates more efficiently. Apart from the economical effects, the usage of the carriers offer notable benefits to the environment.\n\nJakub Kolbicz, Manager of IT Project and Processes Management says, \"The added value here is eliminating the necessity to print or copy a few hundred thousand documents a year repeatedly, because any approvals and document views are made using an application designed specifically for that purpose.\"\n\nStandardisation of office platform, including all printing machines and electronic fax systems operating as a part of such a platform, makes it possible for the employees to incorporate electronic documents into circulation. Thus, the necessity to copy documents many times disappears and fax messages are received through mailbox without the need to print them.\n\nPKN Orlen's good practices are already well-established in the reports published by the Responsible Business Forum. \"Optimization of PKN ORLEN Regional Structures\" aroused great interest in 2005, while the following practices: \"Company's Corporate Culture\" and \"Employees' Voluntary Service\" as a part of category \"Workplace\" and \"Improvement of Road Traffic Safety in Poland\" as a part of category \"Society\" were presented in 2006. The latter practice, presenting a social campaign entitled \"ORLEN. Safe Roads\" won such wide acclaim that it was recommended once more in the 2007 Report, and a practice entitled \"PKN ORLEN for Employees\" was presented together within the section \"Workplace\".\n\nMirella Panek, President of Responsible Business Forum, says, \"We hope that, just like every year, the practices we included in the 2008 Report will inspire new companies and show a more responsible side of Polish businesses.\" The Responsible Business Forum is the first and only non-governmental organisation in Poland which deals with the concept of corporate social responsibility globally.  \nThe Forum was established in 2000 on the initiative of business, academic and nongovernmental circles. \n\nPress Office\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2009-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Ecologically, economically, electronically.","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"The  electronic document circulation system, introduced by PKN ORLEN last year, was  recognised as an exemplary and highly valuable practice by the Responsible  Business Forum.

(PGNiG) signed a Joint Operation Agreement to work on an Exploration-Production Project located in the North-Western part of Poland. \n\nThe Project is a continuation of exploration and appraisal work carried out by PGNiG in the Polish Lowlands. The proposed area of investigation is located in the most prosperous region for hydrocarbon exploration in Poland. The initially appraised oil discovery is located in the nearest vicinity of the biggest fields discovered by PGNiG during recent years in Poland.   \nThe gross geological resources (STOIIP) are presently estimated at 130 mmbbl, whereas recoverable reserves are at 26 mmbbl. In the conceptual stage of development approximately 15 mmbbl are expected to be produced. \n\nThe Project will be led by ORLEN Upstream Sp. z o.o., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PKN ORLEN that was set up with the purpose of implementing ORLEN’s upstream strategy.   \nORLEN’s commitment in the Project is going to be 49% (for 49% of participation in expenditures ORLEN will receive 49% entitlement to future crude oil production incomes) versus 51% belonging to PGNiG. PGNiG will be the field operator.   \nThe estimated expense for this cooperation will not exceed 400 mm zloty. The cost will be spread in years so in first few years of realizations expenses will not exceed 50 mm zloty, the majority of expense will be spend in future years. \n\nThe implementation of joint operations with PGNiG is the next step for ORLEN in building a diversified upstream portfolio and business experience. \n\nPGNiG is a leading company in exploration and production in Poland. Currently it possesses over 70 licenses. In this year alone PGNiG plans to invest 650 million zlotys in exploration in Poland. \n\nThe Project is considered as the first real step of viable cooperation between ORLEN and PGNiG in the upstream sector.

On March 1st 2010 an education campaign was launched as part of the “ORLEN. Safe Roads” programme.\n\nAccording to data from the World Health Organisation (WHO), road accidents come ninth on the list of sudden causes of death. Every year, 1.3 million people die in road accidents, with some 5,000 killed in Poland. Improper road behaviour that includes fatigue, excessive speed, drunk driving, or failure to fasten seat belts are among the causes of approximately 85 percent of all road accidents, say data provided by the Polish Chief Police Headquarters. Though drunk driving or excessive speed are talked of a lot, fatigue driving is still perceived as less important. Drivers very often do not make regular stops during long-hour drives or set off for the trip after a sleepless night.\n\nThe European Commission, and also the Polish National Road Safety Council, recommend drivers to make regular stops. Although EU standards and Polish laws that relate to mandatory breaks during trips are applicable to professional transport drivers, ORLEN has launched an education campaign on proper behaviour that would make all the travellers aware of that problem. “Our company has been for years consistently acting towards improvement of safety on Polish roads.Since 2006 we’ve run the “ORLEN. Safe Roads” programme with education activities being its important element. Currently, we’re organising the fourth edition of the programme. This time we want to make people aware how much depends on our attitude while on the road. We want to teach proper behaviour, thus preventing tragedies from happening,” stresses Jacek Krawiec, CEO of PKN ORLEN.\n\nThe campaign encourages drivers to make stops during long tiring trips of 20 minutes each, every 2 hours of driving which is enough for the driver to recuperate, improve fitness, and get well. “That rest will not only allow refreshing the driver’s mind, but to a large extent will provide for a continued and safe trip,” explains Krzysztof Hołowczyc, Poland’s top rally driver. He adds by saying that teaching proper attitudes and behaviour has an enormous impact on improving road safety. “We constantly remind drivers about the most obvious truths – not to drive too fast and not to get behind the wheel while under the influence. Equally important is whether we’ve rested, slept well, and have good energy. Therefore, it’s important to make regular stops during the trip that will allow to restore your good shape. Those few moments can save someone’s life, and it’s obviously better to get to your point of destination a bit later, but more safely,” appeals Krzysztof Hołowczyc. \n\nThere can be lots of reasons of fatigue among drivers. Apart from the obvious ones like the lack of sleep or “overwork”, the ability to concentrate is also affected by age, the personality type, level of stress, mood, season of the year, weather conditions (temperature, pressure, heat, and precipitation), the road quality, traffic (e.g. road jams), and even the time of the day when we drive. As seen from the statistics, the largest risk of falling asleep while driving is between midnight and 6:00 in the morning (with the highest one at 4:00 am) and between 1:00 and 4:00 in the afternoon. “Research confirms that the impact of drivers’ fatigue on road safety is huge. When we’re tired, the psychomotor abilities deteriorate affecting: reflexes and divided attention, sight and movement co-ordination, assessment of speed and distance, sensitivity to glaring, and accommodation of the eye lens to darkness. Fatigued drivers travel less smoothly and frequently make violent moves with the steering wheel, they more often drive off to neighbouring lanes causing the risk of collision. Fatigue also affects the driver’s mood – he’s more inclined to be irritated more easily, erroneously reads signals from others, or more aggressively responds to what’s going on around on the road. It’s easy to lose control over the vehicle and cause an accident. It’s enough for the driver to close his eyes for two seconds only, and the car driving at 90 km\/h will have driven 50 meters out of control,” confirms Andrzej Markowski, Deputy Chairman of the Polish Association of Traffic and Transport Psychologists.\n\nAccording to estimates by the Polish Motor Transport Institute (ITS) and the Polish Association of Traffic and Transport Psychologists (SPT), fatigue that leads to making erroneous decisions while on the road may cause as much as 10 to 25 percent of accidents. \n\nStatistics and research results are the key arguments confirming the necessity of staging an appeal campaign to make regular stops during trips. You cannot neglect fatigue since its consequences may be very dangerous, and a mere 20-minute stop may safe many lives. You cannot cheat physiology by switching off heating, opening windows, talking with passengers, or listening to loud music. Only stopping a car and having a rest will do. Regular breaks are an opportunity to recuperate, stretch your legs, drink some coffee, or have a light meal. Staff at PKN ORLEN petrol stations will remind all travellers about that.\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2010-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Safety Break in the Trip","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"Driver’s rest time during the trip is a very important element of drive safety, appeals PKN ORLEN in a social campaign.

{"id":8241,"text":"ORLEN Upstream discusses perspectives of shale gas mining in Poland at the Global Shale Gas Summit 2010 conference in Warszawa.\n\nWiesław Prugar, President of the ORLEN Upstream Management Board, presented the most important assumptions of PKN ORLEN’s mining plans for the near future during the Global Shale Gas Summit 2010 conference held on 19-20 July in Warszawa.   \n“Development of the upstream segment represents a key element of the long-term strategy of PKN ORLEN. At present we are focusing on the evaluation of the potential of all exploration and mining projects with particular attention to the mining of shale gas resources. We are also involved in geological research, the assessment of mining conditions as well as on the selection of an investment partner who would ensure access to the necessary technology and share the risk involved in this sort of ventures”, explained Wiesław Prugar. \n\nPKN ORLEN holds five exploration licenses for the Lublin area totaling 4,728 square kilometers in surface of which the area with the highest potential in shale gas measures 1,200 square kilometers. The second stage of intense research and geological work is currently nearing the end and should enable an assessment of the deposit potential and the impact of shale gas mining on the environment. Reports from the aforementioned work is available in the enclosed video file and at  \n  \nhttp:\/\/www.orlen.pl\/PL\/CentrumPrasowe\/Wideokonferencje\/Strony\/default.aspx. \n\nLow urban development of the area (below 5%) as well as favorable environmental conditions on the licensed area provide a good starting point for successive investment decisions in this region. “We are planning the first bore in the Lublin region for next year. We expect that it will confirm shale gas deposits in amounts enabling its mining on an industrial scale”, declared Wiesław Prugar. \n\nORLEN Upstream is a company belonging to the ORLEN Capital Group which conducts exploratory and mining investments. The company is implementing investments on the Baltic Sea shelf (Latvia) in cooperation with the Kuwait Energy Company on the basis of two licenses. Two bores are planned for next year in the scope of that cooperation. ORLEN Upstream is also planning two successive bores in the area of Sieraków within the scope of a mining project jointly conducted by PKN ORLEN and PGNiG.

Zlochevskyy, the Ukrainian Minister of the Environment and Natural Resources. Present at the occasion were also representatives of ORLEN Upstream, the Group's exploration and production arm, which will be directly engaged in cooperation with the Ukrainian side. \n\nUnder the cooperation agreement, PKN ORLEN and its Ukrainian partners are to jointly conduct exploration and production projects, related to both conventional deposits and shale gas.

Importantly, we are launching operations in Ukraine - one of the development directions envisioned in our strategy. Our plans will be implemented together with Ukrainian partners, who possess a wealth of relevant expertise.

{"id":8283,"text":"PKN ORLEN has launched Europe’s most advanced petrochemical complex for paraxylene and terephthalic acid production (PX\/PTA). Present at the event marking the launch was Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. \n\nThe new complex, which is Poland's first and the most efficient complex of its kind in Europe, comprises facilities located at PKN ORLEN’s plant in Płock (paraxylene production) and in Włocławek (terephthalic acid production). The project was completed in a record short time of three years and cost more than EUR 1bn.\n\nAs the only company from our part of Europe, ORLEN has joined the prestigious group of producers delivering high quality PTA – the key feedstock in the production of PET (polyethylene terephthalate), used to make packaging and polyester fibers. Demand for PTA is growing at the most robust rates in Central and Eastern Europe and – since a majority of PTA consumers are located in close proximity to PKN ORLEN’s plant – this means a convenient access to an extremely prospective market. Large amounts of PTA are also consumed by the Chinese, Indian and Western European markets. PKN ORLEN is well placed in terms of its technical resources, organisation and logistics to supply PTA from the new complex also to those markets, on which it has already concluded relevant sales contracts. \n\nORLEN’s PX\/PTA complex is the second largest and most advanced industrial complex of this kind in Europe. Its production capacities amount to 400 thousand tonnes of paraxylene and 600 thousand tonnes of terephthalic acid per year, which represents 20% of Europe’s total output. \n\n“Given the scale of production, pioneering use of cutting-edge technologies and capital invested, the new complex is a project of strategic importance for the whole Polish petrochemical industry. For our Company, the launch of Poland’s first PX\/PTA complex is a landmark project, which extends our value chain. It is our response to very rapid changes throughout the industry, which require us to keep exploring new growth opportunities and profitable technology solutions. We are confident that the new project will strengthen the Company's position and, consequently, increase its shareholder value,” said Jacek Krawiec, CEO of PKN ORLEN. \n\nThe PTA plant in Włocławek occupies an area of 16ha, on which 15 new buildings were erected and more than 800 various facilities, such as tanks, reactors, exchangers and pumps, were installed. 25,000 cubic metres of reinforced concrete were used to construct the plant, whose steel structures weigh 5,200 tonnes. Additionally, 7,000 lines of different pipelines, measuring from a few to several thousand metres in length, were built. \n\nThe PX\/PTA complex includes unique equipment with large dimensions and weight, among them: a 700-tonne compressor, a titanium-lined reactor weighing 450 tonnes, and dryers weighing 260 tonnes each. Because of their size, some pieces of the equipment could only be transported by water. \n\nThe construction of PKN ORLEN’s new complex was also a project unique on the Polish market in that it involved cooperation and know-how sharing between experts from Poland, Japan, the US and Italy. It was implemented in cooperation with the world's leading technology and equipment vendors: Mitsubishi Chemical Engineering Corporation, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Fluor SA and Universal Oil Product. At the crucial moment, the number of engineering and blue-collar staff working on the project exceeded 2,000. While the project was still under way, many of them participated in training provided by international suppliers and study tours of similar facilities operating abroad. The general contractor for the construction and assembly work was Polimex-Mostostal SA. \n\nORLEN purchased the license to manufacture paraxylene from US-based Universal Oil Product. The detailed engineering design, as well as equipment deliveries, were made by engineering firm Technip Italy (IT TP). The license to manufacture PTA was purchased from Mitsubishi Chemical Engineering, which also developed and provided the engineering design for the PTA units. The PTA production technology offered by Mitsubishi Chemical Engineering Corporation is among the most advanced in the world. \n\nPress Office  \nPKN ORLEN\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2011-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Launch of Europe’s most advanced PX\/PTA complex.","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"PKN ORLEN has launched Europe’s most advanced petrochemical complex for paraxylene and terephthalic acid production (PX\/PTA).

{"id":8313,"text":"The second international ShaleScience conference has begun in Warsaw. Scientists and experts from around the world are discussing the quality parameters of rock formations containing shale gas, as well as the possibilities of improving the process of hydrocarbon extraction. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has taken part in the opening of the event. \n\nThe second ShaleScience conference entitled “Developing the Mental Picture of Reservoir Quality and Completion Quality for Tight Shales” is taking place on May 16th–17th 2012 in the Copernicus Science Centre in Warsaw. The conference has been organised by ORLEN Upstream, Energy and Geoscience Institute – University of Utah and the Schlumberger Innovation Center, SLC, USA, under the aegis of the Polish Minister of Environment. \n\nDuring this year’s conference, the experts are focusing on two important factors underlying the economic viability of shale gas production. \n\n“We will analyse the reservoir quality of shale plays in Poland, including the conditions under which gas was generated and trapped millions of years ago, as well as the most effective completion techniques, focusing on rock susceptibility to fracturing and necessary parameters of stimulation treatments designed to enhance recovery of non-conventional resources,” explains Wiesław Prugar, President of ORLEN Upstream. \n\n“Understanding the reservoir and completion quality is crucial for estimating potential production volumes, improving production efficiency and developing more effective extraction technologies,” says Roberto Suarez-Rivera, head of the Schlumberger Innovation Center. \n\nSeeing that a considerable portion of gas reserves discovered around the world, including Poland, are accumulated in medium quality reservoirs, scientists will also focus on this type of formations in their analyses and discussions. Understanding the properties of such plays may be of paramount importance in tapping enormous reserves of hydrocarbon energy. In the light of current technological progress, such reservoirs have limited recovery potential due to low permeability, low porosity (hindering the accumulation of hydrocarbons) and low pore pressure. Therefore, experts participating in the conference will discuss development directions for gas recovery techniques. \n\n“Currently, this is one of the most exciting challenges and most crucial issues in the area of unconventional hydrocarbon resources,” adds Mr Suarez-Rivera. \n\nLast year’s ShaleScience conference entitled ,,Evolution of the Mental Picture of Tight Shales” was intended to provide the right perspective on shale rock characteristics. In North America unconventional resources have been important contributors to hydrocarbon supply for over ten years now. The possibility of recovering natural gas trapped in shale has an enormous impact on developments in the exploration and production sector. New methods of extraction are constantly improved to reduce costs and enhance production rates. Unfortunately, scientific knowledge of rock formations is not yet adequately reflected in the technologies used, which may lead to lower production efficiency resulting from the fact that universal technological solutions are applied to reservoirs with widely varying parameters. During the first ShaleScience conference, scientists and experts from all around the world strove to fill that gap and juxtapose various ideas of shale formations to arrive at a single, consistent and adequate set of guidelines. \n\nPress Office  \nPKN ORLEN\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2012-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ShaleScience Conference - quality of shale gas reservoirs","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"The second international ShaleScience conference has begun in Warsaw.

{"id":8319,"text":"Today, PKN ORLEN started work on its first shale gas exploration well in the Province of Warsaw, in the Garwolin licence area. The occasion marking the launch of the drilling work in the village of Goździk was attended by Minister of the State Treasury Mikołaj Budzanowski and PKN ORLEN's CEO Jacek Krawiec. \n\nThe location of the well in the village of Goździk (municipality of Górzno, county of Garwolin) was chosen on the basis of positive results of geological surveys, which revealed possible shale gas accumulations at the depth of approx. 4,000 metres. The scope of the ORLEN Group's exploration work has been extended to cover the Province of Warsaw following a decision to step up the Group's research programme related to the search for unconventional gas plays. Goździk-OU1 is the third vertical well to be drilled by ORLEN. This year, ORLEN is planning to drill between five and seven exploration wells, including horizontal ones stimulated by hydraulic fracturing. \n\n\"With each newly drilled well, we are getting closer to an accurate estimate of the actual potential of the deposits. The determination and commitment shown by Polish operators can only be envied by foreign licence holders, which sometimes give up work after just a few attempts. This confirms our belief that Polish shale is very much a national project. We are also proving that - when it comes to pursuing goals that make business sense - we have been and will be consistent,\" said Mikołaj Budzanowski, Minister of the State Treasury. \n\nThe drilling work in the Garwolin licence area is expected to continue for some 60 days. DRILLMEC DM-1300, transported to Goździk straight from an Italian factory, is one of the most advanced drilling rigs currently operating in Poland. After the well has been drilled, approx. 300 metres of core material (rock samples) will be taken for laboratory analyses. Based on their results, which will be known by the end of 2012, ORLEN Upstream will decide whether to carry on with the exploration work in Goździk. \n\nThe launch of the work within the Garwolin licence area coincided with the receipt by PKN ORLEN of the results of analyses of rock samples collected in late 2011 from the Syczyn-OU1 well, within the Wierzbica licence area in the Lublin region. The results are so promising that a decision has been made to drill a horizontal well at the location. \n\n\"The answer to the recently repeated question \"what will take the place of the Euro 2012 project\" is: the exploration for, and then the production of, Polish shale gas. Polish economy will first be propelled by expenditures on new wells and then, in a few years' time, by cheaper gas, which will be purchased from local companies rather than foreign ones, so the money will stay in Poland,\"said Jacek Krawiec, CEO of PKN ORLEN. \"For this year, we have contracted two advanced drilling rigs and two drilling crews, which will be carrying out work in the successive locations. As a result, the work in the Province of Warsaw will be carried out simultaneously with our operations in other parts of Poland,\" stressed Jacek Krawiec. \n\nPKN ORLEN holds eight licences for oil and gas exploration throughout Poland: six in the Provinces of Lublin and Warsaw, and two in the vicinity of Łódź and Sieradz. Preparations are also under way to spud the first offshore exploration well on the Baltic Sea.

{"id":8331,"text":"Today, PKN ORLEN spudded another exploration well in the Lublin region: in the village of Berejów, within the Lubartów licence area. It is already a second horizontal well to be drilled by PKN ORLEN this year. \n\nThe results of laboratory analysis of 300 metres of rock samples taken during vertical exploration drilling in the commune of Niedźwiada, which was finished in the first quarter of 2012, have persuaded PKN ORLEN to return to the licence area. The analysis focused on the properties (physical, mechanical and geochemical), as well as the gas and organic matter content of the rock core. The promising results of the study prompted a decision to continue exploration work in Berejów, by drilling a directional well there. \n\n“Such analyses, which usually take months to complete, are a crucial stage of our work, allowing us to investigate the properties of a given shale gas play. Based on their results, we can make decisions regarding further wells, their designs and methods of recovery enhancement, i.e. fracking. The analysed rock core samples from the first well have revealed the presence of hydrocarbons in Berejów. Now we must estimate the volumes and - most importantly - the economic viability of the prospect,” said Wiesław Prugar, President of the ORLEN Upstream Management Board. \n\nWork on the second well in Berejów will take some 50 days. Its total length, including the horizontal section (over 1,000 metres), will reach approximately 3,800 metres. Next year, PKN ORLEN is also planning a hydraulic fracturing treatment of the horizontal section. A production test will follow to assess the gas flow rates in the region. \n\nBerejów-OU2K is a second horizontal well to have ever been drilled by PKN ORLEN. The first one, with the total length of 4,100 metres, was made by PKN ORLEN in autumn in Syczyn, within the Wierzbica licence area. Since 2011, as part of its unconventional hydrocarbon exploration programme, PKN ORLEN has finished work on four investigation wells, and is ready to launch another two by the end of this year. \n\nIn line with its strategy for 2013–2017 announced on November 30th 2012, in the next five years PKN ORLEN may spend up to PLN 5.1bn on upstream projects, chiefly shale gas exploration and production projects. As part of the PLN 2.4bn core CAPEX budget, at least 50 wells will be drilled, with first profits from the upstream projects expected to be seen in 2017. \n\nPress Office   \nPKN ORLEN\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2012-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"PKN ORLEN’s second horizontal drilling","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"Today, PKN ORLEN spudded another exploration well in the Lublin region: in the village of Berejów, within the Lubartów licence area.

{"id":8337,"text":"The Wierzbica and Lubartów licence areas will be the site of the first two hydraulic fracturing treatments PKN ORLEN intends to perform in H1 2013. \n\nThe Company has already drilled a total of five wells in search of shale gas, including three vertical and two horizontal ones. The work is most advanced in the Wierzbica (village of Syczyn) and Lubartów (village of Berejów) licence areas. The objective behind drilling the first vertical exploration wells was to collect core samples for laboratory testing. The analysis focused on the physical properties, as well as the content of gas and organic matter held in the shale rocks. The results were promising enough to prompt a decision to continue drilling operations both in Syczyn and in Berejów. \n\nHydraulic fracturing is to be performed on the horizontal sections that have already been drilled. The first treatment is to be conducted in April 2013 in the Syczyn well situated in the Wierzbica licence area. It is planned to take place on the 1,000-long lateral drilled through gas-bearing shales at the depth of 2,700 metres, and will be divided into ten stages. The works, scheduled to last 10 to 20 days, will be performed by Schlumberger, the company that won the contract. \n\nPreparations for the fracking operation have been under way for many weeks now. First of all, PKN ORLEN drew on the expertise of foreign consultants who prepared a simulation based on the collected data. Then, a design was developed and put out to tender. Given strict technical requirements set by ORLEN Upstream, only companies with adequate technology and equipment resources took part. The contract was awarded to Schlumberger. Cooperation with the subcontractor's specialists and experts with the Oil and Gas Institute of Kraków will continue until the process is completed. Together with ORLEN Upstream's team, they are to provide ongoing oversight of the progress and to monitor the results of the fracking operation, and to take measurements that will help optimise the applied solutions in the future. \n\n“In line with the strategy published at the end of 2012, we intend to step up our upstream projects. We are actively working on the final fracking parameters, but also on scheduling all the other projects,” said Jacek Krawiec, President of PKN ORLEN Management Board. \n\nThe operation has been designed to use a water-based fracturing fluid containing quartz sand of appropriate granulation as the proppant that will keep the induced fractures open. Once the process of cracking the rock is over, gas flow obtained from the well will be tested. The test will enable a preliminary appraisal of the gas reserves in the area and their commercial viability. The second hydraulic fracturing operation will take place within the Lubartów licence area. \n\n“Each hydraulic fracturing treatment is designed to match the site-specific geological conditions. Lessons learned during the hydraulic fracturing operation in Syczyn may, however, influence the parameters of the subsequent fracking treatment in Berejów. It is nothing out of the ordinary as regards exploration practice. A broader range of input helps eliminate errors in data interpretation,” added Wiesław Prugar, President of ORLEN Upstream Management Board. \n\nAccording to PKN ORLEN's revised strategy announced in late 2012, the Company will intensify its hydrocarbon exploration efforts in 2013–2017.

In accordance with its terms, today PKN has repurchased the reserves from Ashby and has taken over their ownership.  \n  \nThe transaction value of approximately USD 400m, including settlement of the forward contract hedging the purchase price of oil, is close to the amount of proceeds received from the sale of the oil a year ago. As a result, approximately PLN 1.3bn will be posted under \"stocks\" for the first quarter of 2013.

{"id":8348,"text":"PKN ORLEN has officially launched construction work on what will be the largest state-of-the-art CCGT plant in Poland. The new 470 MWe unit will generate heat and electricity simultaneously, using the co-generation technology. This highly efficient and environment-friendly generation method will be used e.g. by Anwil and PKN ORLEN. The foundation stone ceremony for the project was held today. The new CCGT plant is expected to be commissioned by the end of 2015. \n\nThe Włocławek-based project is PKN ORLEN's flagship endeavour in pursuit of the Company's strategy in the power segment. The key advantage of the project is the co-generation technology, which significantly enhances the efficiency of electricity and heat generation. The unit will meet Anwil's entire demand for electricity, and will also be the main source of process steam for the Włocławek facility. About a half of the Włocławek plant's total output of 470 MWe will be sold to external customers, and the plant will consume 0.6-0.7bn cubic metres of gas annually. The annual electricity output of the unit would be enough to meet the needs of a few hundred thousand Polish households, while its hourly gas consumption equals that of approximately 65,000 gas cookers. \n\nClose proximity to the GAZ-SYSTEM network and the PSE OPERATOR power grid make for an advantageous location of the new plant in Włocławek. Close proximity to Anwil's facilities with their existing infrastructure has helped to optimise capital expenditure. \n\n\"We have decided to use a technology relying on natural gas, which is environmentally friendly and beneficial in terms of CO2 emissions. Also, since we are engaged in shale gas exploration, our choice was clear. The new plant in Włocławek is an important stepping stone in the planned development of our power segment, as one of the pillars of the Company's new strategy for the next five years,\" said Jacek Krawiec, President of the PKN ORLEN Management Board.  \n  \nThe heart of the Włocławek plant will be the so-called \"Power Train\", its most complex part comprising an approximately 330-tonne gas turbine, a 420-tonne generator and an over 350-tonne steam turbine.  \n  \nThe unit will be constructed by General Electric in consortium with SNC Lavalin. In order to ensure that the power train works efficiently, PKN ORLEN has entered into a long-term servicing agreement with General Electric. The value of the contracts is estimated at PLN 1.1bn (exclusive of VAT) and approximately PLN 200m, respectively. The overall costs of the project are estimated at approximately PLN 1.4bn.  \n  \nThe new plant could also provide business stability to locally based specialist servicing firms. In future the plant will undergo regular servicing and maintenance, allowing such local companies to keep optimum levels of personnel with specialist knowledge of the technologies used at the plant.  \n  \nThe number of staff required to man the new plant is estimated at over 30 persons. The staff recruitment process should be completed by the end of this year. The following two years will be devoted to training intended to prepare the new staff for work.\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2013-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ORLEN starts construction work on its CCGT project in Wloclawek","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"PKN ORLEN has officially launched construction work on what will be the largest state-of-the-art CCGT plant in Poland.

{"id":8349,"text":"HIGHER SALES AND GOOD OPERATING PERFORMANCE DESPITE A VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT\n\nIn Q1 2013, PKN ORLEN reported improved LIFO-based operating performance and maintained its good financial position despite major market challenges: deceleration of economic growth and lower consumption of fuels. The ORLEN Group's total sales volumes increased by 4% (y-o-y), driven primarily by growth in the refining segment. LIFO-based EBITDA rose by more than PLN 150m, the main contributor being a nearly 40% increase in the LIFO-based EBITDA posted by the petrochemical segment. \n\nIn line with the dividend policy provided for in the Company's strategy, the Management Board recommended distribution of dividend of PLN 1.5 per share. In pursuance of the assumed investment policy, preparatory work on the construction of a power unit in Włocławek was successfully completed, and construction work commenced. The exploration projects on the licences held by ORLEN Upstream have been consistently implemented. The sixth research borehole was completed, and another two are being prepared. In the weeks to come, the first horizontal drilling with fracturing will be performed. As part of our efforts to diversify financing sources, launch of a retail Bond programme is being considered \n\nIn Q1 2013, PKN ORLEN recorded: \n\n  * LIFO-based EBIDTA higher by PLN 150m year on year \n  * LIFO-based EBIT of PLN 0.4bn \n  * Sales volumes up by 4% year on year \n  * Financial leverage at 26.9% \n\n\n\nThe Company's performance in Q1 2013 was driven by improving petrochemical and refining margins, declines in fuel consumption seen on all home markets , as well as the foreign exchange rates. The Group's revenue fell by 6% year on year, mainly due to the effect of non-recurring events, including sale of a batch of mandatory stocks in Q1 2012. LIFO-based EBITDA was up by 20%, to PLN 932m, on the back of higher refining and petrochemical margins and higher sales volumes. LIFO-based EBIT was PLN 394m, almost doubling relative to the Q1 2012 figure. \n\n\"The first quarter was difficult, owing to the economic slowdown and flagging fuel consumption. However, our performance was supported by the refining and petrochemical margins and the higher sales volumes. This enabled us to maintain a sound liquidity position and therefore we can go ahead with uninterrupted implementation of the investment programme to diversify our future revenue sources,\" said Jacek Krawiec, CEO of PKN ORLEN.\n\nThe higher margins translated into improved performance of the petrochemical segment, which earned LIFO-based EBIDTA of PLN 678m, up 38% year on year. The positive effect of favourable macroeconomic developments in the polymer and monomer margins was limited by a drop in the sales volumes of those products, as customers optimised their stocks. At the same time, weather conditions stifled demand for fertilisers, which was then partly offset by a growth in PVC volumes. \n\nThe refining segment's LIFO-based EBIDTA for Q1 2013 was PLN 276m, down 11% year on year. However, after elimination of one-off factors, it is higher by approximately PLN 200m. \n\nThe retail segment's EBITDA grew by 7% relative to the previous year, although it was strongly affected by the year-on-year deceleration in the GDP growth rate across all of PKN ORLEN's markets, as well as the significantly lower consumption of fuels. In Q1 2013, the demand for gasolines decreased by 6-10%, depending on the market, and the demand for diesel oil fell by 2-4% (except in the Czech Republic, where it expanded by 2%). These market conditions translated into a 4% decline in the retail segment's sales, offset by revenue from sale of non-fuel products and some improvement in margins in Poland. As at the end of the quarter, EBIDTA stood at PLN 123m. \n\nThe Company's financial ratios are at a safe level. While the Company's debt did grow in Q1 2013, chiefly on account of the repurchase of a batch of mandatory stocks and translation differences on the remeasurement of foreign currency borrowings, the financial leverage remained flat year on year, at the safe level of 26.9%. \n\n\"Despite the market challenges seen in the first months of the year, at the end of the first quarter we successfully maintained our sound financial position. . This enabled us to recommend, for the first time in five years, distribution of dividend in the amount of PLN 1.5 per share,\" said Sławomir Jędrzejczyk, Vice-President of the Management Board and ORLEN's Chief Financial Officer. \n\nThe production asset investment programme provided for in the Group's strategy until 2017 ammounted to more than PLN 300m in Q1. As part of the tasks performed in individual areas, the construction of the Flue Gas Desulphurisation Unit in Płock was begun. We are also continuing construction of a vacuum flasher at ORLEN Lietuva. Thanks to the application of advanced technology, the first of these projects will reduce sulphur dioxide emissions from the CHP plant by 97%, while the other project will boost the refinery's fuel yield by more than 2pps. In the petrochemical segment, the Ammonia Unit at Anwil is being modernised and work on the Olefin and Suplhuric Acid units in Płock is ongoing. Purchases of technology licences for the Phenol and Metathesis units have commenced, and efforts are being made to reduce the energy intensity of the Olefin and PX\/PTA units. The retail segment is developing and sales Network optimisations are under way. Q1 saw the launch of four new service stations in Poland, ten locations were modernised (nine in Poland and one in Germany), and six were closed. Likewise, 108 new Stop Cafes and Stop Cafe Bistros were launched during the year, bringing their number up to 800. \n\nPKN ORLEN is preparing to drill further exploratory wells, to be performed in Q2 and Q3 this year. The Company also completed its sixth borehole into unconventional reservoirs, and is preparing the next two, as well as its first ever fracturing, in the Wierzbica and Lubartów licences. \n\nThis year, PKN ORLEN also has plans focusing on conventional exploration for natural gas and crude oil. Work is under way on the second appraisal well, located in the Polish Lowlands, and on preparation for the first drilling in the Latvian shelf, planned for the second quarter of this year.\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2013-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","title":"PKN ORLEN’s Q1 2013 consolidated financial results","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"HIGHER SALES AND GOOD OPERATING PERFORMANCE DESPITE A VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT\r\nIn Q1 2013, PKN ORLEN reported improved LIFO-based operating performance and maintained its good financial position despite...","article_url":"https:\/\/a.orlen.pl\/EN\/PressOffice\/Pages\/PKN-ORLENs-Q1-2013-consolidated-financial-results.aspx","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":8373,"text":"Moody's Investors rating agency today raised PKN ORLEN's credit rating from Ba1 to Baa3, with a stable outlook. The rating agency recognised the Company's perseverance in maintaining stable financial results and its rational approach to capital expenditure planning. Moody’s is the second rating agency, after Fitch Ratings, to have upgraded PKN ORLEN's rating to the investment grade this year. Thus, after more than four years, the Company has regained its investment grade rating from both of the world's leading rating agencies.\n\nIn the justification to its decision, Moody’s analysts stressed that the upgrade was due to the improvement in operating performance and financial indicators reported by the Company over the last several years, despite the difficult macroeconomic conditions persisting in the European refining sector. The rating agency also recognised the Company's stable liquidity situation, as well as the reduction of its financial leverage and its maintenance at a safe level. \n\nMoody’s analysts viewed the Company's strategy, adopted in November 2012, as ambitious. The strategy provides for significant financial flexibility, a dividend yield of up to 5% during the next several years depending on the Company's financial standing and macroeconomic conditions, as well as a sustainable investment policy. Emphasis was placed on the creation of standby capex, which will be utilised depending on the implementation of key investment plans and the prevailing macroeconomic conditions, particularly in the power generation and upstream segments.\n\nSince 2009, when Moody's lowered the Company's credit rating to Ba1, PKN ORLEN's net debt has been reduced to PLN 4.8bn (as at the end of Q3 2013), thereby reducing its financial leverage to 17.8%. In the same period, key revenue-boosting projects were completed, including Europe's most advanced PX\/PTA unit, which was placed in service in June 2011.

{"id":8385,"text":"CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES DESPITE SERIOUS CHALLENGES IN REFINING\n\nLast year, the ORLEN Group consistently pursued its strategic objectives and operational goals. The Company paid out dividend for the first time since 2008, at a yield of 3.8% (based on the average ORLEN stock price in 2012), and regained, after four years, investment grade ratings from Fitch and Moody’s. It also diversified its financing sources through a successful PLN 700m issue of retail bonds. Development projects in the exploration and production and power generation segments continued to proceed on schedule, and the Group was joined by TriOil following acquisition of an equity interest in the Canadian production company. Concurrently, by the end of Q4 2013 PKN ORLEN reduced its debt by PLN 2.2bn, to PLN 4.6bn.   \nDespite these strategic achievements, the steady decline in refining margins, coupled with expansion of the grey economy, weighed heavily on the ORLEN Group's financial performance in 2013. The poorer results posted by the refining segment were partly offset by improvements in the petrochemical and retail segments. \n\nIn 2013, PKN ORLEN reported:  \n• LIFO-based EBITDA of PLN 3.2bn  \n• Revenue of PLN 113.8bn   \n• Positive operating cash flow of PLN 5.7bn   \n• Crude oil throughput up 1% year on year   \n• Total sales volume of nearly 36m tonnes  \n• Very good operating result of the retail segment at PLN 1.3bn, and of the petrochemical segment at PLN 2bn. \n\n\"Last year we had to face a very challenging environment in the refining industry, to prove once again that with our good liquidity position and sustainable growth strategy we are able to successfully operate and deliver stable results, despite the adverse conditions\", said Jacek Krawiec, PKN ORLEN's CEO. \"2013 was a breakthrough year for us. The acquisition of TriOil, a Canadian production company, positioned us as a global player, expanding into new operating areas, namely power generation and hydrocarbon production. In the long term, this should make us even more resilient to the changing conditions in the refining sector\", Mr Krawiec added. \n\nThe retail segment, with LIFO-based EBITDA at PLN 324m, recorded the highest year-on-year growth of the result in Q4 2013. This increase was supported by higher fuel margins in Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania, as well as higher sales volumes in all markets except Germany, where sales volume fell by 5%. In Q4 2013, the Company strengthened its position and expanded market shares in Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania. It also continued dynamic expansion of its non-fuel sales, adding 83 new Stop Cafe and Stop Cafe Bistro food outlets to its service station network in Q4 2013 alone, bringing the total to 1,047 sites. \n\nA very solid result of PLN 420m was posted by the petrochemical segment, though the amount was slightly less than in Q4 2012, mainly due to lower margins on petrochemical products. The weakening of the average PLN\/EUR exchange rate and higher sales of fertilizers, PTA and PVC also contributed, although lower sales volumes of olefins and polyolefins caused by maintenance shutdowns earlier in the year partially offset the result.\n\nThe refining segment continued to be strongly affected by macroeconomic factors. At the end of last year, it had to cope with the lowest refining margin and Ural\/Bent differential since 2002, whose negative effect on the segment’s results was as much as PLN 552m. All in all, the LIFO-based EBITDA came in at PLN 51m. Higher sales volumes in Poland and improved fuel yields from the Płock and Mažeikiai refineries were among the refining segment's operating achievements in Q4 2013, although these were offset by lower sales in the markets served by ORLEN Lietuva and in the Czech Republic. \n\nBy taking steps to limit its working capital and reduce debt, PKN ORLEN managed to secure an excellent liquidity position.Last year, the Company sold its mandatory stocks for PLN 1bn. As a result of the measures taken, at the end of the year the debt was down by PLN 2.2bn (yoy), to PLN 4.6bn, relative to the end of 2012. Thus in Q4 2013 the financial leverage was brought down to a safe 16.9%, with the covenant net debt\/EBITDA ratio at 1.83. \n\nPKN ORLEN's investment plans and objectives were well received by both Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors, which raised the Company's credit ratings to BBB- and Baa3, respectively. Thus, after more than four years, the Company regained its investment grade rating from both of the world's leading rating agencies.\n\n\"It was at this exact time last year that we announced the regaining of our investment grade rating as a priority in 2013. With the high evaluation of our operations by Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors, we've proved that perseverance in the pursuit of ambitious goals brings visible results,\" said Sławomir Jędrzejczyk, Vice-President of the PKN ORLEN Management Board and CFO. \"Continuous attention to financial security is one of the key elements of our investment plans in this highly-volatile macroeconomic environment,\" Mr Jędrzejczyk added.\n\nIn line with its strategy, PKN ORLEN made a number of investments in production of crude oil and gas from conventional and unconventional deposits. To date, the Company has completed a total of 9 wells, including 7 vertical and two horizontal, and has carried out two horizontal fracturing treatments. Data collected on these occasions have been thoroughly analysed and will be used to plan further exploration work. Last year, the Company also drilled two conventional wells, including one in the Latvian shelf licence area. As analyses of the latter well failed to yield the desired results, the Company decided to discontinue operations in the region. Also in 2013, through the acquisition of 100% of the shares in Canada’s TriOil Resources Ltd., PKN ORLEN acquired a portfolio of producing oil and gas assets, as well as unique know-how of hydrocarbon extraction from unconventional deposits. PKN ORLEN will draw on the Canadian company’s experience in its own gas and oil exploration efforts in Poland, building its position as a business diversified across a range of sectors. \n\nIn the power generation segment, all of the Group's projects proceeded according to schedule. Work was also begun on the construction of a 463 MWe combined-cycle co-generation gas turbine (CCGT unit) in Włocławek, the foundations of which are now being laid. The unit’s key components – turbine, boiler, generator set and transformers – are expected to arrive to the site in the first quarter of 2014. The concept for a similar project (a 450-600 MWe CCGT unit), in Płock, is also being worked up, with a final decision due in mid-2014. \n\nLooking back at 2013, the thing of note was the confidence of independent financial and industry experts enjoyed throughout the year by PKN ORLEN. The Company topped Euromoney's list of the best-managed oil companies in Central and Eastern Europe, and was among the leading names in the Coface TOP 500 ranking of the largest CEE companies for the eighth consecutive time. In Platts’ Global Energy Company Ranking, PKN ORLEN was listed high, in the 79th position, and was included in the WSE's RESPECT Index of socially responsible companies for the sixth time. It also received an accolade from IR Magazine for having the best investor relations in Poland, while its 2012 annual report won the Tax and Accountancy Institute's prestigious ‘The Best of The Best’ title. In a ranking put together by the Rzeczpospolita daily, ORLEN emerged as the most valuable Polish brand, valued at PLN 3.9bn. In addition, the Company was again awarded a Top Employers Polska 2013 certificate. \n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2014-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","title":"PKN ORLEN’s consolidated financial results","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES DESPITE SERIOUS CHALLENGES IN REFINING\r\nLast year, the ORLEN Group consistently pursued its strategic objectives and operational goals.

{"id":8397,"text":"On June 9th−10th, the third edition of the international ShaleScience conference will be held in Warsaw, bringing together scientists and experts from Poland and around the world to discuss shale gas recovery techniques that could prove the most effective in the Polish geological setting. The speakers will draw on the first available results of the prospecting operations carried out in 2009−2014, and will undertake a comparative analysis of Polish and American reservoir properties.\n\nThe third ShaleScience conference, entitled 'Evolution of the Notion of Shale Gas Stimulation', will be held on June 9th−10th at the Copernicus Science Centre in Warsaw. The event's founder and organiser is ORLEN Upstream, the leader in shale gas exploration in Poland. The partners of the conference are leading research centres from Poland and abroad: AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków, the Oil and Gas Institute – National Research Institute, and the Energy and Geoscience Institute – University of Utah. The event will be held under the honorary patronage of the Polish Ministry of the Environment, and will be attended by the world's experts in geology, geophysics and petroleum engineering. The main focus of this year's conference will be to formulate the most effective approach to the design and implementation of techniques for the stimulation of Polish shale rock formations given their specific geological properties.\n\n“Despite the difficult geological conditions, PKN ORLEN is continuing its exploration work and keeps developing its knowledge and expertise. We are determined in our efforts to adapt the world's latest technologies to our needs, test our own techniques, increase our knowledge, and share experience, all with the aim of improving the prospects of commercial production of shale gas in the future and fully unlocking the potential of domestic unconventional deposits, ” explained Jacek Krawiec, President of the PKN ORLEN Management Board.\n\nThe geological properties of Polish shale and the results of appraisals and tests carried out to date clearly show that the average estimated gas production from wells drilled into shale formations may be relatively low. In addition to the geological factors, the commercial viability of shale gas projects in Poland is also strongly affected by the high costs of exploration activities, partly due to the depth of shale formations (more than 3,000 metres below ground level) and an inadequate geological database for the region. \n\n“The results of exploration work conducted since 2009 have provided evidence that the Polish geological setting varies greatly and is much more demanding than that of shale basins found in North America. This means that recovery techniques used on the other side of the Atlantic are not suitable for immediate use in Poland. We are departing from the generally applicable and widely recognised techniques to develop our own innovative methods of tapping into unconventional resources. Based on the accumulated experience, not only are we able to identify the differences in well stimulation in Poland, but also the factors which adversely affect the results achieved so far,” noted Wiesław Prugar, President of the ORLEN Upstream Management Board.\n\nThe idea behind the ShaleScience conference, founded by ORLEN Upstream back in 2011, is to provide a forum for sharing knowledge and practical experience, geared towards enhancing the expertise and knowledge we need to be able to recover hydrocarbons from shale.   \nThe key topics for discussion during this year's ShaleScience gathering, entitled 'Evolution of the Notion of Shale Gas Stimulation', will be:\n\n  1. comparative analysis of the lower Paleozoic geological formations in Poland with their rare analogues (rock formations featuring similar geological properties) found in North America\n  2. design and execution of shale stimulation treatment specific to the Baltic, Lublin and Podlasie basins\n  3. environmental challenges of hydraulic fracturing at the exploration and appraisal stage of a project \n\n\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2014-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Third ShaleScience conference - how to bring polish shale to life","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"On June 9th−10th, the third edition of the international ShaleScience conference will be held in Warsaw, bringing together scientists and experts from Poland and around the world to discuss shale gas...","article_url":"https:\/\/a.orlen.pl\/EN\/PressOffice\/Pages\/Third-ShaleScience-conference-how-to-bring-polish-shale-to-life.aspx","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":8403,"text":"The attractiveness of developing shale gas is obvious, and there is no shortage of investors around the world ready to take on the associated financing risk. To attract them however, a favourable legal, fiscal and social climate is needed. In this respect, Poland enjoys a good starting point, was the conclusion of the debate which took place on the last day of the 4th European Financial Congress. One of the panellists was Wiesław Prugar, President of the Management Board of ORLEN Upstream.\n\nStarting from the 1st edition of the European Financial Congress, of which PKN ORLEN is a co-organiser, the energy future of Europe has been a prominent theme in debates. In its Recommendations of two years ago, the Congress stated it was imperative to take advantage of the opportunities that shale gas offered for Europe and its competitiveness. Over the recent months, given the changing geopolitical backdrop, the discussion about Europe's energy self-sufficiency has gained particular importance. This is why, this year the Programme of the European Financial Congress was for the first time formally extended to include topics related to energy security.\n\nA debate devoted to the issue (“The investment attractiveness of shale gas exploration and production in Poland”) was organised on the last day of the Congress. Participants of the discussion, which was moderated by Agnieszka Łakoma of the Polish Press Agency, included Wiesław Prugar, President of the Management Board of ORLEN Upstream, Zbigniew Skrzypkiewicz, Vice-President of the Management Board of PGNiG, Mateusz Pociask, a Partner at EY, Andrzej Sikora, President of the Institute of Energy Studies, and – as a special guest – the Polish Minister of Environment Maciej H. Grabowski, who presented an overview of the current legal framework regulating the exploration for and production of shale gas in Poland. “One of my priorities has been to accelerate the legislative work. Drawing on the best global practice, we have proposed changes which go in the right direction, safeguarding the interests of the state, the environment, and investors,” said Maciej H. Grabowski.\n\nWiesław Prugar, President of the Management Board of ORLEN Upstream, also commented on the legislative changes: “There have been many improvements. The over-regulation has been removed, but we still need to look for solutions that would encourage Polish and international firms to get involved in this risky though highly promising business. The simpler the law, the better for all parties concerned, including the business and the government,” argued Mr Prugar. “The changes already made create quite clear and reasonable operating conditions. The possibility of setting up consortia is a very important novelty – risk sharing is a common practice in the industry, but so far it has been objectively difficult in Poland,” said Mateusz Pociask, a Partner at EY.\n\nThe President of the Management Board of ORLEN Upstream noted that, from the business point of view, it was good that the first wave of excessive hopes related to shale gas in Poland had somewhat subsided. “We are past the infantile euphoria and fascination. Now, the Polish shale gas project is entering maturity. All parties to the process understand that what we need now is prudence, patience, determination, good judgement and ...lots of hard work to search the vast prospective areas for resources that would offer the best potential for successful commercialisation,” explained Mr Prugar. \n\nORLEN Upstream, a company of the ORLEN Group, is the leader in terms of the number of boreholes drilled in Poland. “We have drilled ten wells, performed two large-scale fracking treatments and are preparing for a third one, scheduled for August,” said Mr Prugar about the company's achievements to date and plans for the future.\n\n“I remain optimistic: compared with other European countries, Poland is much more advanced in shale gas exploration and production,” added Maciej H. Grabowski. On the other hand, the debate participants admitted that the role of the unquestionable leader, besides the clear first-mover advantage, had also its downsides. “Pioneers are easy to recognise for bullet holes in their backs,” the Minister of Environment concluded. “Given the small number of shale gas production projects in Europe thus far, no professional service providers have yet emerged. For the sake of comparison, the competitive pressure on prices offered by drilling companies in the US is much stronger, which helps optimise investment costs” said Zbigniew Skrzypkiewicz, Vice-President of PGNiG.\n\nIn 2010-2013, companies operating in Poland spent over PLN 2bn on shale gas exploration and production. The Hydrocarbon Upstream Industry Organisation estimates that by 2021 the value of such investments will have reached PLN 14bn. “There is no shortage of capital globally ready to accept such risk levels and provide financing for such projects. But in the end that capital will go to where the premium is the highest. In the US there are states which drill up to 1,600 boreholes per year, and it is no problem to raise financing for such drilling campaigns,” said Wiesław Prugar. \n\nIn Wiesław Prugar's opinion, to be able to attract that capital to Poland we need to create the right climate for shale gas as well as a friendly legal, regulatory and fiscal environment. “The global map of places offering the most attractive investment opportunities changes dynamically, which explains why some companies have abandoned their plans to drill in Poland. If opportunities reappear, they will come back,” added Mateusz Pociask, a Partner at EY. \n\nMuch of the discussion was devoted to the new geopolitical landscape in Poland and Europe. Participants of the debate agreed that common European thinking about shale gas would be a chance to strengthen our energy security, especially in the face of shrinking conventional reserves. “The events in Ukraine have changed the way in which EU leaders think about secure energy supplies,” noted Maciej H. Grabowski. At the same time, the Minister of Environment announced that Poland and the UK would draft a report for the new European Commission showing how the developing shale gas industry could positively affect European economy. \n\n“Brussels' key problem is that only five years ago each member state was left to its own devices regarding energy security. A common economic policy is also lacking. We are not United States of Europe, and so talking about a ‘bloodstream’, or joint purchases of gas, is nothing but wishful thinking. If we want to have a European industry, be it steel, car making or chemicals – we need our own resources,” was the strong conviction expressed by Andrzej Sikora, President of the Institute of Energy Studies. \n\nWiesław Prugar, President of ORLEN Upstream, added: “I am not a politician, but as a EU citizen I would like Europe to go for projects consistent with the current trends of energy saving, reduction of CO2 emissions, and mitigation of the environmental impact of business. This is why shale gas development should be a broader, pan-European project,” said Mr Prugar.  \n\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2014-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","title":"There is future in shale gas","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"The attractiveness of developing shale gas is obvious, and there is no shortage of investors around the world ready to take on the associated financing risk.

{"id":8427,"text":"​Today, PKN ORLEN has published its first interactive, integrated on-line annual report, which combines financial reporting and CSR reporting, and takes into account the guidelines of the International Integrated Reporting Council. It also reflects the latest directions in the EU legislation on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information. The report’s new formula is a natural step in adapting this form of communication to market trends and stakeholder expectations.\n\nThe PKN ORLEN 2014 Integrated Report, entitled ‘Fuelling the future’, shows interactions and interrelations between the financial and non-financial aspects of PKN ORLEN’s and certain ORLEN Group companies’ operations. It reflects global standards and trends in corporate reporting, promoted by organisations such as the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). These new guidelines encourage firms to abandon performance reporting based strictly on their organisational structure in favour of a more dynamic and multidimensional approach to communication with stakeholders. The pillars of integrated reporting, which have also been taken as a basis for navigation through the PKN ORLEN report, offer a comprehensive insight into the life of the Company and its value creation efforts. The report presents non-financial data in compliance with the G4 version of the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines. It is only available on-line and is compatible with mobile devices. \n\n“For a number of years now, PKN ORLEN’s operating environment has been changing dynamically. It is our ambition not only to adapt to these changes, but also to drive them. Implementing the integrated reporting framework places us among companies setting the highest standards in communication with stakeholders. Even more importantly, it demonstrates our approach to long-term creation of the Company value. In line with the Company’s strategy, the process should be carried out in such a way as to benefit all of our stakeholders.

{"id":8429,"text":"​   \nPKN ORLEN has launched the construction of a CCGT unit at the Płock production plant. The new heat and power generation unit, with a capacity close to 600 MWe, is to be brought on stream in late 2017 or early 2018. The project’s budget is planned at PLN 1.65bn. The foundation act was signed by Piotr Chełmiński, member of the PKN ORLEN Management Board responsible for Business Development and Power and Heat Generation, and Peter Baudrexl, President of the Management Board of Siemens Sp. z o.o.  \n  \nThe CHP plant, with a state-of-the-art combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), will supply steam and electricity to the Płock Production Plant, while any surplus of electricity is to be supplied to the National Power Grid. The new unit will cogenerate heat and electricity. The advanced cogeneration technology based on natural gas, which is environmentally friendly and beneficial in terms of CO2 emissions, will be similar to the process used in the CCGT unit at Włocławek. Both units will offer high efficiency, low environmental impacts, and high utilisation rates throughout a year. 3 TWh of electricity produced at Płock will be sold to external customers in Poland, while steam will be used entirely by ORLEN Group’s production facilities and by local customers.  \n  \n”Our industrial heat and power generation projects based on natural gas will, first and foremost, markedly enhance the operational excellence of our downstream segment, which comprises refinery and petrochemical production, sale of fuels and petrochemical products, as well as sale of energy and heat. Gas-fired cogeneration brings climate-related benefits and is, to a large extent, environmentally neutral, which remains one of our top priorities. I do believe that our projects are not only an optimum solution in every respect for the ORLEN Group, but also boost Poland’s energy security and support the development of the regions in which we operate. A maximum of 700-1,000 people, mainly subcontractors, will be working on each construction site in the peak period”, said Piotr Chełmiński, member of the PKN ORLEN Management Board responsible for Business Development and Power and Heat Generation.  \n  \nPKN ORLEN signed a contract for the turn-key delivery of a CCGT unit with the Siemens consortium, in Płock in late 2014. The parties also entered into a comprehensive O&M contract for the unit’s key equipment, covering a period of approximately twelve years from the launch of the CHP plant.   \n  \nTo date, PKN ORLEN has secured most of the permits required for the Płock project, including a network connection agreement with Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne and Gaz-System. At the end of July, the final rotor alignment test was successfully completed for the gas turbine at the Siemens factory in Berlin. The heart of the Płock CHP plant, a nearly 400-tonne gas turbine, will be shipped to Płock by sea and then up the Vistula river. In 2016, it will be connected to the steam turbine and the generator to form a powertrain. The turbine, offering generation efficiency of more than 60%, will burn gas at the temperature exceeding 1,500°C, with very low environmental emissions. The Płock CCGT unit will use H-technology, which is the most efficient power generation technology currently available worldwide, and will be the first unit of its kind in Central Europe excluding Germany. The staffing process will be completed in early 2017, and training and preparation programmes are planned for 2018. The personnel will work on the project from the commissioning of the unit.   \n  \nPKN ORLEN’s refinery and petrochemical complex at Płock currently includes a CHP plant which generates heat and power in high-efficiency cogeneration, using heavy fuel oil and gas to generate steam in boilers. The Płock unit is the largest industrial facility of its kind in Poland and one of the largest in Europe. It supplies power to PKN ORLEN’s key production plant and heat to the town of Płock, offering total electric power generation capacity of 345 MWe and thermal capacity of 2,149 MWt. A comprehensive programme designed to ensure that the existing CHP plant complies with environmental standards which will come into effect as of 2016 is nearing completion. After the new CCGT unit is brought on stream, both units will run in parallel to substantially increase operational flexibility and security of steam and electricity supplies to the Płock plant and to external customers.  \n  \nThe investment projects at PKN ORLEN are designed to enhance the Company’s power and heat generation potential. The current total installed capacity at PKN ORLEN’s generating assets in Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania is more than 760 MW for electrical power and nearly 5,000 MW for heat. With the two new projects in operation, installed capacity will increase by 1,060 MW and 630 MW, respectively.   \n\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2015-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ORLEN to build Poland’s largest gas-fired CHP plant","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"​ PKN ORLEN has launched the construction of a CCGT unit at the Płock production plant.

The agency also commended the company’s consistency in reducing its debt. Moody’s believes that PKN ORLEN’s strategy announced in late 2016 sets out ambitious yet realistic financial and investment targets. The rating also reflects PKN ORLEN’s strong presence in Central and Eastern Europe, the high level of integration between its refining, petrochemical and retail businesses, as well as its leading position in the Polish wholesale and retail fuel markets.\n\n“The rating upgrade means a lot to us, especially in the context of how we are perceived by the financial markets.

Altogether, the construction site saw over 25,000 qualified workers contributing to the project at different stages. Poland’s first high-capacity CCGT unit (463 MWe) will enhance the ORLEN Group’s operational excellence, while strengthening the national energy security. \n\nIt will ensure electricity and heat for ANWIL and a couple of other entities, with some of its heat output distributed throughout the Włocławek industrial complex, of which the plant is an integral part. All surplus electricity will be supplied to the National Power Grid. In terms of its environmental footprint, the unit complies with all the latest requirements of Polish and EU legislation.\n\n“Increasing the efficiency of our assets is one of the key objectives of our strategy. At both of our major energy projects, one built in Włocławek and one in Płock we are looking as part of a bigger picture. They are integrated with existing infrastructure, which allows us to maximise synergies while optimising capital expenditure,” said Wojciech Jasiński, President of the Management Board of PKN ORLEN.\n\nClose proximity to the GAZ-SYSTEM network and the PSE power grid make for an advantageous location of the new CCGT unit in Włocławek. The first gas power plant was built for PKN ORLEN by a consortium of General Electric and SNC-LAVALIN POLSKA. To keep its power train fully operational, PKN ORLEN has entered into a long-term servicing contract with General Electric. Upon completion of the investment phase, PKN ORLEN and the general contractor will enter into negotiations regarding financial settlements of the project.\n\nThe CCGT unit in Włocławek is one of PKN ORLEN’s two key cogeneration projects, the other one still being developed in Płock. Electricity produced by the two CCGT units in the high-efficiency cogeneration process will be used for the ORLEN Group’s in-house needs and sold in the domestic market. The Włocławek and Płock plants are industrial power projects tailored to the ORLEN Group’s needs, greatly enhancing the operational excellence of its Downstream business.\n\nThrough these projects, PKN ORLEN is gradually building up its power and heat generation potential. The Włocławek project having been completed, the total installed capacities of PKN ORLEN’s generation assets in Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania have come to 800 MWe for electrical power and nearly 4.6 GWt for heat. With the completion of the Płock project, the electrical power and heat generation capacities will increase by another 600 MWe and 530 MWt, respectively.\n\nThe Company’s energy projects are not focused solely on improving the efficiency of its Downstream business. PKN ORLEN is also working to increase the energy self-sufficiency of its service stations. It is now analysing the results of pilot photovoltaic solar energy projects implemented at PKN ORLEN facilities.

{"id":8487,"text":"​PKN ORLEN, holding a 62.9% equity interest in Unipetrol a.s., has launched a conditional voluntary tender offer for shares in the Czech company. The offer is conditional on PKN ORLEN acquiring at least 90% of Unipetrol’s share capital. \n\nUltimately, PKN ORLEN aims to buy all Unipetrol shares and have the company delisted from the Prague Stock Exchange. The transaction is in line with the Group’s strategy for 2017–2021, which envisages integration of refining assets, extension of the petrochemical value chain, and development of the retail network.\n\nUnipetrol a.s. is the largest refining and petrochemical group in the Czech Republic. It owns the refineries in Litvínov and Kralupy, the largest local retail chain Benzina (400 service stations), and Spolana, the sole PVC and caprolactam manufacturer on the Czech market. The company’s core asset is its Litvínov petrochemical operations – now the construction site for a polyethylene unit, the country’s largest petrochemical project to date. \n\n“The current ownership structure prevents PKN ORLEN from reaping the full benefits of the initiatives we have put in motion in the Czech Republic, including our efforts to improve the refining and sales efficiency and our investments in the petrochemical assets. Also, minority shareholders have expressed different expectations regarding the dividend policy. Once we acquire full control of Unipetrol, we will be able to better leverage the synergies from our optimisation measures and the enhanced segment management,” said Wojciech Jasiński, CEO and President of the PKN ORLEN Management Board and Chairman of the Unipetrol Supervisory Board. \n\nTenders in the offer announced by PKN ORLEN will be accepted from December 28th 2017 to January 30th 2018, and the transaction is scheduled to be settled on February 23rd 2018. PKN ORLEN is offering CZK 380 per share, which is close to the price at which Unipetrol shares are currently trading on the Prague Stock Exchange. This means that acquiring a 90% and 100% equity interest would cost PLN 3.05bn and PLN 4.2bn, respectively. \n\nThe price in the tender offer was set on the basis of a valuation prepared by a reputable advisory firm engaged by PKN ORLEN, and was additionally reviewed and approved by an independent investment bank. The terms of the transaction do not differ from market valuations of companies with a similar business profile. \n\nThe transaction will be financed with PKN ORLEN’s own funds and with a syndicated loan facility available to the company. After the buyout is completed, the Group’s net debt will remain at a safe level, with no adverse effect to its credit rating. \n\n“In our strategy, we have allocated to investments PLN 5.4bn on average in each of 2017 and 2018. Taking full control of Unipetrol will not affect our other acquisition plans, nor will it result in any revision to our dividend policy,” assures Wojciech Jasiński, PKN ORLEN’s CEO. \n\nPKN ORLEN is a leading-edge player on the fuels and energy markets, and the largest company in Central and Eastern Europe, listed in the prestigious global rankings (such as Platts TOP250 and ThompsonReuters TOP100). In 2016, the ORLEN Group posted nearly PLN 80bn in revenue and a record-high LIFO-based EBITDA of PLN 9.4bn. The Group owns state-of-the-art integrated infrastructure with an annual processing capacity of over 30 million tonnes of various types of crude oil, and markets its products through the region's largest network of over 2,700 modern service stations. It invests in power generation assets in Poland – this year the potential of its newly built CCGT units will reach 1.1 GWe. The Group also has its own oil and gas assets in Poland and Canada.  \nORLEN has long occupied the top spot among Poland's most valuable brands, with its value estimated at PLN 3.9bn. This year PKN ORLEN has also received − for the fourth consecutive time and as the only company in the region − the coveted title of The Most Ethical Company from the US-based Ethisphere Institute. For many years, ORLEN has remained a business champion and industry leader in Poland and in Central Europe.   \n\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2017-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"PKN ORLEN intends to take full control of Czech-based Unipetrol","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"​PKN ORLEN, holding a 62.9% equity interest in Unipetrol a.s., has launched a conditional voluntary tender offer for shares in the Czech company.

{"id":8493,"text":"​Improved engine cleaning properties and emission reductions: these are the features of the new EFECTA 95 and EFECTA Diesel fuels confirmed by independent tests. By cleaning car engines, EFECTA fuels prolong their lifespan and improve performance. As of today, they are available across the ORLEN retail chain, replacing EuroSuper 95 and Ekodiesel Ultra.  \n  \nThe tests showed that EFECTA 95 is able to remove up to 65% of existing sediments in the engine and prevent up to 98% of new sedimentation. The fuel reduces friction and has a 30% higher lubricity compared with gasolines without any additives. The fuel’s properties remain unchanged for a long time, protecting engine components against corrosion and physical wear.   \n  \nAs for EFECTA Diesel, advanced technologies allow it to remove sediments and keep components of the fuel system and the engine clean. The test of EFECTA Diesel’s cleaning properties revealed that the fuel helps remove at least 50% of sediments already after the first fill-up. Filling up with this fuel on a regular basis makes it possible to restore up to 98% of the original injector efficiency. The fuel also facilitates the operation of pumps and injectors by reducing friction and protects the surface of engine components against corrosion, while the applied anti-foaming solution makes refilling easier.   \n  \nThe tests also confirmed the extent of emission reductions achievable with EFECTA fuels. Compared with gasolines without additives, the new EFECTA 95 enables a reduction of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter by, respectively, around 8% and 51%, while EFECTA Diesel reduces NOx and PM emissions by ca. 4% and 44%, respectively. The tests also confirmed a reduction of CO2 emissions.  \n  \n‘On a highly competitive market, such as the one where we operate, it is impossible to gain an advantage without investing in the development of products and services. The fuels we are rolling out today are a perfect example of how to put innovation into practice. With the use of advanced technologies, we have managed to develop products that place us at the leading edge of the fuel industry, while bringing tangible benefits to our customers,’ stressed Daniel Obajtek, President of the PKN ORLEN Management Board.   \n  \n‘Adding the new fuels to our offering entailed a number of logistics and technology-related challenges, but we have managed to complete the process successfully. Starting from today, the EFECTA fuels, which set market standards for improving a car engine’s lifespan and performance, will be available across Poland through our chain comprising 1,700 service stations. I am positive that these products will not only allow us to strengthen relationships with existing customers, but also to reach new consumer groups,’ said Zbigniew Leszczyński, Member of the PKN ORLEN Management Board, Sales.   \n  \nThe cleaning properties of the new EFECTA fuels have been confirmed through rigorous tests carried out by certified laboratories of SGS, the world’s leading inspection, testing and certification company. BOSMAL, on the other hand, was responsible for checking how the new fuels perform in normal operating conditions using the latest available testing methods and procedures.

{"id":8541,"text":"​PKN ORLEN is investing in the expansion of the Olefins Complex at the Płock Production Plant. It is the key project in the strategic Petrochemical Development Programme and the largest petrochemical investment project in Europe in the last 20 years. The Olefins III Complex will be built using state-of-the-art technologies to ensure, among others, greater energy efficiency, including a 30% reduction of CO2 emissions per tonne of the product. In view of the rising CO2 prices, this will directly improve the competitiveness of the Production Plant. The project is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2024 and production launch is planned for early 2025. The Olefins Complex will cover an area of almost 100 ha, or over 140 football fields. The project will add about PLN 1bn to the company’s annual EBITDA.   \n  \nThe petrochemical products manufactured in the Olefins Complex will be the basis for producing all kinds of everyday items, such as cleaning, hygiene and medical products, as well as synthetic fibres for the production of protective clothing and masks. They will also be used to produce car parts, components of household appliances and electronic devices, etc.  \n  \n“This is an important moment for PKN ORLEN and the Polish petrochemical industry. We are taking a major step towards significantly expanding the petrochemical segment at the Płock Production Plant, which – once the Olefins III Complex is completed – will be one of the most modern facilities of this type in Europe. With this project on-stream, PKN ORLEN will join the top petrochemical producers in the European market. It will also secure its competitiveness in the long run and increase its resistance to unfavourable mega-trends in the fuel market. Importantly, the project fits with the merger of Orlen and Lotos, which will supply significant volumes of kerosene to the Olefins. Petrochemicals have a huge potential. We want to harness it to deliver maximum value, in response to the steadily growing demand for high-margin petrochemical products. This will benefit the Group companies, our shareholders and the Polish economy, which will become even more competitive,\" said Daniel Obajtek, CEO and President of the PKN ORLEN Management Board.  \n  \nThe expansion of the Olefins Complex at the Płock Production Plant is part of the ORLEN2030 strategy, which assumes that PKN ORLEN will achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In furtherance of this goal, the company aims to reduce carbon emissions from its existing refinery and petrochemical assets by 20% and cut down carbon emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity by 33% by 2030.  \n  \n“For the last three years, PKN ORLEN has been in the largest investment process in its history. The process covers all areas of its operations: refining, petrochemicals, power generation, including from renewable energy sources, and the retail business. In this way PKN ORLEN strengthens its position in Europe and globally, and guarantees dynamic growth of the Polish economy and national energy security. The expansion of the Olefins Complex creates a development opportunity for the Polish chemical industry and a reliable source of supply, especially for local buyers of petrochemical products,” said Jacek Sasin, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State Assets, at the press conference.  \n  \nPKN ORLEN‘s investment project will also benefit the LOTOS Group, which will supply petroleum products for the production of petrochemicals. The city of Płock and neighbouring municipalities will also profit as new jobs will be created at the expanded Olefins Complex. The project will ultimately increase PKN ORLEN’s workforce by approximately 380 FTEs. The entire petrochemical project will generate PLN 160m in taxes for the state budget. The project will also increase the availability of base petrochemicals, which will serve as a platform for the development of Poland’s chemical industry and bring more positive effects for the entire economy.  \n  \nThe implementation of this strategic project has been greenlighted by the PKN ORLEN Supervisory Board which, in granting the consent, took into account the submission of an application for public aid to the Ministry of Development, Labour and Technology. The project’s value is estimated at PLN 13.5bn, based on a lump-sum bid for the Steam Cracker and the related units, as well as detailed estimates of expenditure on the necessary infrastructure. The plan for the project has been prepared in line with the world’s best practices.   \n  \nThe Supervisory Board’s decision opens the way to sign a contract for the expansion of the Olefins Complex III under the EPCC formula with preferred bidders, namely Hyundai Engineering and Técnicas Reunidas. In addition, special purpose vehicle ORLEN Olefiny has been established to implement the project.  \n‘We are proud that our offer has attracted significant interest from PKN ORLEN. The Olefins Complex expansion project is a great opportunity for us to increase our presence in Europe as a world-class EPC contractor,’ said Chang Hag Kim, CEO of Hyundai Engineering.  \n  \n‘We are glad to be involved in the implementation of such an important project, which will be the cornerstone for the development of PKN ORLEN’s petrochemical business. By engaging in this project we will maintain our presence in Poland and confirm our readiness to support PKN ORLEN in implementing future projects,’ said Juan Lladó, CEO of Técnicas Reunidas.  \nExpansion of the Complex will be the first project of this type carried out in Europe in recent years. Other European companies have also noticed the potential represented by base petrochemicals and announced plans to expand their olefin production capacities. However, thanks to its effective project preparation and contracting strategy, PKN ORLEN has outpaced the competition by over 12 months and it will be the first to address the shortage of base products on the market.   \n  \nThe expansion of the Olefins Complex will make it possible to leverage the economies of scale, which are vital for PKN ORLEN’s competitiveness. At present, the Company has a 5% share in the European petrochemical market. Once the project comes on stream, the share will increase to 6.4%. In this way, PKN ORLEN will consolidate its leading position in Central Europe and join the group of the largest petrochemical producers, such as Dow, Sabic, Ineos or BASF.   \n  \nCurrently, the Steam Cracker’s capacity is 640 thousand tonnes. The Olefins III project envisages increasing its actual production capacities to 1,040 thousand tonnes, that is by approximately 60%. The ORLEN Group’s total petrochemical output, currently amounting to more than 5 million tonnes, will grow by over 1 million tonnes.  \nThe implementation of the project marks a significant step towards strengthening the Płock Production Plant’s petrochemical segment. Following production launch, scheduled for early 2025, the share of crude oil used to manufacture petrochemical products in Płock will rise from 14% to 19%. This is all the more important given the declining demand for refining products and an expected increase, by as much as 80%, in demand for high-margin petrochemicals by 2050.   \n  \nAs part of the project, PKN ORLEN will consider shutting down the part of the olefin plant which was built over 40 years ago, with production capacity of about 340,000 tonnes and lower operational and energy efficiency. The more modern part, with a capacity of about 300,000 tonnes, is to be upgraded. Most importantly, however, the Group will build a new Steam Cracker with a capacity of 740,000 tonnes. The Complex will also comprise five additional production units, including a new large ethylene oxide and glycol plant. Once completed, Olefins Complex III will additionally increase PKN ORLEN’s capacity to produce other ethylene derivatives, delivering an extra margin and maximising the rate of return.\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2021-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","title":"PKN ORLEN starts the largest petrochemical project in Europe","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"​PKN ORLEN is investing in the expansion of the Olefins Complex at the Płock Production Plant.

February 2019    * European Commission gives RWE antitrust clearance for acquisition of E.ON and innogy renewables operations   * German Federal Cartel Office approves the acquisition of a minority stake in E.ON by RWE    Today, the European Commission approved the acquisition of the renewables operations of E.ON and innogy by RWE without any conditions. The company had filed the transaction with the Commission for review in the middle of January. Also today, the German Federal Cartel Office approved RWE’s acquisition of a 16.7% interest in E.ON. This was preceded by extensive preliminary reviews by the Commission and the German Federal Cartel Office in order to obtain a precise picture of the effects of the transaction with E.ON on competition.  “This is very good news. Thanks to this decision, we have passed another milestone en route to turning RWE into a leading global player in the field of renewable energy,” declared Markus Krebber, CFO of RWE AG.  The far-reaching transaction with E.ON will involve RWE acquiring the renewable energy businesses of E.ON and innogy. Added to this are E.ON’s minority interests in the Emsland and Gundremmingen nuclear power stations operated by RWE, innogy’s gas storage business and its stake in the Austrian power utility Kelag. In addition, RWE will acquire a 16.7% equity interest in E.ON. RWE filed this part of the transaction with the UK Competition & Markets Authority yesterday. Furthermore, the acquisition of the US assets will be submitted to the US anti-trust authorities in the near future.  On execution of the transaction, which RWE intends to complete in the second half of 2019, RWE will become Europe’s third-largest producer of electricity from renewables and the world´s No. 2 in offshore wind in one fell swoop. Sixty percent of the generation portfolio of the RWE Group will produce electricity with low or zero carbon emissions. The objective is to continue expanding the business with Renewables on a global scale and spend up to €1.5 billion (net) every year for this purpose.  ### Downloads    * Press Release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2019-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE clears important competition hurdles","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2019-02-26-rwe-clears-important-competition-hurdles","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"pdf_url not found.

April 2019    * New credit line amounts to €5 billion   * Partner is a consortium of 27 international banks    In preparation of the acquisition of the renewables activities of E.ON and innogy, RWE signed a new €5 billion credit agreement on 17 April 2019. The syndicated credit line replaces the existing €3 billion agreement and secures the Group’s liquidity.  The new line consists of two tranches, with terms of two and five years. They can be prolonged for one and two years, respectively. The credit line is being provided by 27 international banks and was substantially oversubscribed.  Dr. Markus Krebber, CFO of RWE AG, emphasises, “The early refinancing of the existing credit line gives us long-term financial flexibility and will enable the smooth integration of the renewables operations of innogy and E.ON. The great feedback from our partner banks is proof of the trust in our business strategy of turning RWE into a leading renewable energy provider.”  RWE AG, with its headquarters in Essen, Germany, has three operating divisions: Lignite & Nuclear, European Power based on gas, coal, hydro and biomass, and Supply & Trading. The company plays a major role in power system operations and security of supply across Europe. Its fourth pillar of business is a majority stake in innogy SE, one of the continent’s leading energy companies. In March 2018, RWE announced that it will transfer this equity holding to E.ON as part of an asset swap. In exchange, RWE will receive the renewable energy activities of innogy and E.ON as well as further assets. The transaction is expected to be executed by the end of 2019. Thus will turn RWE into a leading supplier of renewable energy in Europe, with a total of over 20,000 employees.     ### Downloads    * Press Release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2019-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","title":"To integrate the renewables business, RWE renews and increases syndicated credit line","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2019-04-17-to-integrate-the-renewables-business-rwe-renews-and-increases-syndicated-credit-line","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"pdf_url not found.

{"id":8558,"text":"“Niederaussem becomes the setting for important technological progress”  previous  next  ### Köln, 28. May 2019  Newsfacts:    * One tonne of methanol produced daily at Innovation Centre   * Nine partners finalise EU-funded research project    The objective of the nine European partners joining forces in the “MefCO2 – Methanol fuel from CO2” project was to not only talk about climate protection but to develop the necessary technologies so that they can be used on a commercial scale. In the next few days, the operational phase of the globally unique demonstration plant at RWE’s Innovation Centre will come to an end.  The MefCO2 plant in Niederaussem produces up to one tonne of methanol daily. The ingredients include about one and a half tonnes of CO2, separated from the Niederaussem power plant’s flue gas in the CO2 scrubbing unit, and some 200 kilogrammes of hydrogen produced from water by means of a 1-MW electrolyser. The power needed for the demonstration plant was generated by the power station. However, it intended that future commercial-scale plants increasingly use power from renewable sources.  “With the MefCO2 plant, we have been able to demonstrate a process which can be an alternative to conventional methanol synthesis from natural gas,” said Prof. Dr. Reinhold Elsen, Head of Research and Development at RWE Power. “The process makes it possible to both reuse CO2 captured from exhaust gases from power plants and industry, and to store power from renewable sources in the form of methanol. This methanol could be used to produce electricity in periods when generation from renewables is low.” Moreover, methanol is one of the most important base products in the chemicals industry and is already being used as a low-emission fuel in the transport sector.  The EU funded the international MefCO2 project with €8.6 million. The partners included the Spanish company i-deals, the plant manufacturer Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Carbon Recycling International from Iceland, the Genoa University, Hydrogenics from Belgium, the State Chemicals Institute from Slovenia, the Catalysis Institute from the Welsh capital of Cardiff, the Duisburg-Essen University and RWE Power AG.  During the final event at Niederaussem, the town mayor of Bergheim, Volker Mießeler, said: “We need technological alternatives like MefCO2 which can help us shape the transition from lignite to the “post-lignite” era in an intelligent and sustainable manner. And which helps Bergheim and the region stay well positioned for future developments.”  “With the completion of the MefCO2 project, we have taken another step towards the big goal of a more climate-friendly, low-emission energy world in Europe. This is why the funds contributed by the European Union are well invested,” said Dr. Lars Kulik, member of the RWE Power Executive Board, during the project completion event in Niederaussem. He thanked the diverse team of European engineers and technicians for their work. “I am pleased to see that today‘s specialists have left the turf wars between conventional and renewable far behind them. Today’s engineers are bringing both worlds together and want to make Europe’s energy transition a success for the benefit of climate protection. I am proud that our Niederaussem site is the scene for this technological progress.”  MefCO2 is part of the EU’s “Horizon 2020” framework programme and a SPIRE project. SPIRE stands for Sustainable Process Industry through Resource and Energy Efficiency. SPIRE projects are designed to promote the development of enabling technologies and best practices along all the stages of large-scale value chain productions.  ### Downloads    * Press Release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2019-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"“Niederaussem becomes the setting for important technological progress”","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Power AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-power\/2019-05-28-niederaussem-becomes-the-setting-for-important-technological-progress","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"pdf_url not found.

{"id":8564,"text":"Aberthaw Power Station to be closed  ### Essen, 1 August 2019  RWE has taken the decision to close the 1,560MW Aberthaw B coal fired power station. RWE will transfer Aberthaw Power Station’s existing Capacity Market agreements for the years 2019\/2020 and 2020\/2021 to third parties and a small proportion to other units within RWE’s fleet. In doing so it is assured that the total amount of capacity available under the capacity market remains the same.  Consultation with affected staff and employee representatives will now begin. The proposed date of closure is 31st March 2020.  It has been clear for some time that the market conditions for coal-fired power generation in the UK have been challenging.  Roger Miesen, Chief Executive Officer of RWE Generation says: “This is a difficult time for everyone at Aberthaw Power Station. However market conditions made this decision necessary. I would like to thank all of our staff, past and present, who have contributed to the success of the station for so many years. Over the coming months we will complete the consultation process”.  Tom Glover, Chief Commercial Officer of RWE Generation and RWE UK Country Chair, says: “For nearly 50 years the plant has played an invaluable role in helping to secure the energy supplies across the UK electricity system and we are very proud of its flexibility and resilience. With our flexible gas and biomass power station portfolio, RWE will remain an important player in the UK energy market.”  Aberthaw B Power Station in Wales has played a critical role in the UK’s power generation mix since it began operations in 1971, establishing strong links with the community and contributing millions of pounds to the local economy. Aberthaw Power Station directly employs around 170 people.  The decision to close the station will contribute to the company’s goal to reduce its CO2 emissions step by step. Since 2012 RWE has already decreased its CO2 emissions from power generation by 60 million tons per year, which is comparable to taking 30 million cars off the road.  The details of the Capacity Market Agreement transfer remain confidential.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2019-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Aberthaw Power Station to be closed","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Generation SE","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-generation\/2019-08-01-aberthaw-power-station-to-be-closed","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-generation-se\/2019\/2019-08-01-aberthaw-power-station-to-be-closed.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["unsure"]}

{"id":8570,"text":"The new RWE: carbon neutral by 2040 and one of the world´s leading renewable energy companies  ### Essen, 30. September 2019    * Ambitious CO2 reduction plan: resolute and responsible phasing out of fossil fuels – massive investments in wind and solar energy as well as high-performance storage technologies   * Outstanding starting position in renewables to be build upon with a net investment of 1.5 billion euros per annum    Rolf Martin Schmitz, former Chief Executive Officer at RWE AG  \"Today, Brussels paved the way for the “new RWE”. This makes us one of the world’s leading renewable energy companies. We intend annual net investments of 1.5 billion euros to consolidate and further strengthen this position. Now we are putting all our energy into tackling this task.\"  Dr. Rolf Martin Schmitz, CEO of RWE AG  Carbon neutral by 2040, one of the world´s leading renewable energy companies, a responsible producer of power from all energy sources – this is the formula behind the new RWE. Based on a three-stage CO2 reduction plan, the company has set itself ambitious goals for its strategic realignment. RWE intends to become a carbon neutral company within the next 20 years.   RWE decreased its carbon dioxide emissions by one-third from 2012 to 2018, representing a decline of 60 million metric tons. An additional reduction of approximately 70 percent is envisaged by 2030. RWE will decommission its last coal-fired power station in the United Kingdom to this end. In Germany, more of the Group’s coal power plants will gradually be taken offline, following the recommendations of the Commission for Structural Change. The Dutch government wants its country’s coal-based electricity generation to end by 2030. RWE is in the process of converting the plants in Eemshaven and Amer to fire biomass. The objective is to transform electricity generation from fossil fuel in order to achieve carbon neutral production. In addition to a large international portfolio including wind turbines and photovoltaic units which the company intends to expand continuously, RWE will then place its chips on storage, biomass and gas-fired power stations primarily fired by ‘green’ gas, which will be indispensable to achieving security of supply. “This presents RWE with a huge task. But we have a very clear idea of how to achieve our goal: We will phase out fossil energy sources both consistently and responsibly. We will make huge investments in wind and solar power as well as in high-capacity storage technologies. The new RWE is and will remain one of the major players in the electricity generation business,” declares Rolf Martin Schmitz, CEO of RWE AG.  Growing renewable energy is the clear focus of the new RWE. The renewable energy portfolios of E.ON and innogy, combined to form RWE Renewables, will turn the company into a “global player made in Germany” with an installed capacity of more than 9 gigawatts. Added to this are further assets with a combined capacity of 2.6 gigawatts under construction that will be completed in the near future. The world’s No. 2 in offshore wind and Europe’s No. 3 in renewable energy – these are the starting positions that the company intends to consolidate and strengthen. RWE will provide an annual 1.5 billion euros in net capital expenditure for both offshore and onshore wind turbines as well as photovoltaics and storage. Project partnerships have the potential to increase total investment to between 2 and 3 billion euros per annum.  Diversification via technologies and regions as well as scale and financial strength are the key success factors in the renewables business. Diversification, in order to minimise interdependencies resulting from changing regulatory and political framework conditions. Scale, in order to put technological progress into practice and reduce electricity generation costs. Financial strength, in order to spur growth. These are the decisive factors RWE where to develop renewables projects around the globe.  RWE’s transformation is reflected in its earnings as well. Going forward, only 20 percent of EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) will come from the conventional business. Three times as much, i.e. about 60 percent, will be earned from business with renewable energies, while energy trading will be contributing 10 percent. The remaining 10 percent will come from financial investments, including Amprion, Kelag and E.ON. “In the last few years, we have worked hard to give RWE a robust financial setup and make the company fit for the future. Today, our operations are profitable, our processes are efficient, and we offer our shareholders an attractive dividend. We have the financial, strategic and personnel power required to run renewable energy operations all over the world. This is an outstanding basis from which to seize the opportunities of the future,” underlines CFO Markus Krebber.   The tasks are distributed clearly. In addition to a lean holding company, the new RWE and its 20,000 employees worldwide will consist of four operating companies: RWE Renewables, RWE Supply & Trading, RWE Generation and RWE Power.  “Lignite and nuclear energy have laid the foundations we are building the new RWE on. Past, current and future employees working in conventional areas have our utmost respect. But every form of energy has its time. Now we are opening a new chapter of our corporate history, which looks back on over 120 years. With great enthusiasm for the new world, without forgetting where we came from. Openness, fairness and respect for each other’s work will characterise the new RWE as well,” says Rolf Martin Schmitz.   ### Downloads    * Press Release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2019-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"The new RWE: carbon neutral by 2040 and one of the world´s leading renewable energy companies","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2019-09-30-the-new-rwe","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"pdf_url not found.

The revamped corporate design (CD) characterises RWE’s brand appearance and will be visible across all media with immediate effect. Developed by Scholz & Friends Identify, the CD shows off the new RWE focusing on for transformation, innovation and sustainability. The basic elements of the company’s former market appearance and the well-known RWE logo remain, in order to build a credible bridge between the Group’s more than 120 years of history and its modern, friendly future appearance.  As before, the logo consists of the three capital letters ‘RWE,’ which have become softer and more compact. The corporate colours have been expanded to include green and grey and are lighter and friendlier overall. The new typo is dominated by clear, geometrical lines. RWE’s new imagery provides for a unique, clear-cut brand appearance, placing the human being, nature and technology on centre stage.

With this power purchase agreement (PPA) E.ON buys around 3TWh of power annually from wind farms around Great Britain which are operated by RWE. It covers a capacity of 892MW of onshore and offshore wind generation and includes a proportion of the London Array, currently the world’s second largest offshore wind farm.   Earlier this year E.ON announced it was providing all of its residential customers across Britain with an electricity supply backed by 100% renewable sources – on all tariffs, as standard, and at no extra cost.  The wind farms were originally built by E.ON as part of the company’s £3.3bn investment in UK renewables over the last decade. Ownership transferred to RWE at the start of October as part of the asset swap deal in which E.ON Group took over RWE’s stake in Innogy in return for E.ON’s major renewable energy activities, amongst other things.  Michael Lewis, E.ON UK Chief Executive, said: “A significant element of our commitment to providing all our residential customers with renewable electricity – a change at a scale never seen before in Britain – was the fact we have invested more than £3.3bn in renewable energy in the UK in recent years.   “We have now secured the power coming from all those wind farms, as well as similar arrangements we have with more than a dozen independent generators around the country, which means our customers can continue to enjoy an electricity supply backed by UK renewables. But the future of energy doesn’t stop here – to combat the climate change we are now focusing on helping our customers to better manage their energy through smart, personalised and sustainable technologies such as solar and battery technology, heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers.”  RWE Renewables, the newest subsidiary of RWE has an installed capacity of more than 9GW. Added to this are further assets with a combined capacity of 2.6GW under construction that will be completed in the near future. RWE Renewables is actively seeking corporate PPAs for this capacity.  Tom Glover, Chief Commercial Officer RWE Renewables, said: “Great Britain, where we already operate over 2,000MW of renewable energy plants, is a very attractive market for RWE due to its well-functioning framework. PPAs as are an extremely important instrument that help to achieve renewable build-out targets and offer stability for all parties involved.”  Growing renewable energy is the clear focus of RWE who are the world’s number 2 in offshore wind and Europe’s number 3 in renewable generation – these are positions the company intends to consolidate and strengthen. The company has also set out its goal to become a carbon neutral company within the next 20 years and provide 1.5 billion euros annually in net capital expenditure.  Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are widely regarded as one of the most viable methods for companies and energy suppliers to secure long-term price certainty and meet challenging sustainability targets in a cost-effective way.  E.ON’s announcement in July, moving more than 3.3 million homes to an electricity supply matched by renewable sources including wind, biomass and solar, is the largest of its type to date in the UK, significantly increasing the number of households in the country backed by 100% renewable electricity.  The electricity used by customers is matched with 100% renewable electricity sourced externally through such things as renewable electricity guarantee of origin certificates from the likes of wind, biomass and solar sources. These certificates guarantee that the same amount of renewable electricity was generated to the amount supplied.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2019-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Contract wind: E.ON and RWE complete renewable power supply agreement","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2019-11-12-contract-wind-eon-and-rwe-complete-renewable-power-supply-agreement","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-renewables\/2019\/2019-11-12-contract-wind-eon-and-rwe-complete-renewable-power-supply-agreement.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":8617,"text":"One-stop shop – RWE invests in new control system for power plant dispatch  The new control technology also enables the integration of additional units such as battery storage systems and diesel-powered backup generators. By connecting numerous small units, RWE aims to create a virtual power plant in order to advance the energy transition.  ### Essen\/Zug, 24. June 2020    * System based on Siemens Spectrum Power enables second-by-second control of all assets and integration of RWE wind and solar farms   * Improved combination of electricity generation from renewables and conventional fuel is a major milestone for the energy transition    RWE is making its power station control system fit for the future by adopting a new technology. Optime, a new SCADA system based on Siemens Spectrum Power, gives RWE a uniform control technology. SCADA stands for 'Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition' – in other words monitoring and managing technical processes using a computer system. Previously, there were two separate systems: one for power plants in Germany and another for the Netherlands and Belgium. The new solution combines the two, while integrating RWE’s renewable energy assets in Europe. It can also accommodate additional units such as battery storage systems and diesel-powered backup generators.   The new technology will be used in the RWE Supply & Trading Dispatch Centre on Europe's largest trading floor, which is located in Essen. This is where the central command and control operations of all RWE plants in Europe are located. A wall of monitors several metres high and wide shows in real time which RWE power stations are feeding power into the grid, the    feed-in levels, and which plants are being ramped up or down. Engineers sit in front of the screens and optimise all of RWE's conventional power generation assets around the clock. A powerful command and control system is crucial to this task.   By connecting numerous small units, RWE aims to create a virtual power plant in order to advance the energy transition. The conventional power stations and pumped-storage plants offset the volatility of renewables, and thanks to state-of-the-art technology, can be controlled down to the second. Even the requirements of transmission system operators with respect to system services, grid disturbances and minimisation of balancing energy are optimally met.  Guido Hommelsheim, Head of Dispatch at RWE Supply & Trading, is pleased: “Optime gives us automatic control in real time as well as improved control performance. In addition, it allows us to better coordinate our portfolio, which consists of renewable energy plants, the existing flexibilities of our industrial customers, and conventional power stations. In view of the expansion of renewable energy, this is becoming increasingly important.”  The RWE control team keeps constant watch over developments as they unfold because power supply and demand can deviate from projections, for example in the event of unusual weather conditions or major events. In such cases, the engineers working in the Dispatch Centre must respond quickly. Up to 500 optimisation runs are performed every day using the power plant dispatch optimisation program developed specifically for this purpose by experts at RWE. This program determines the most economical use of all power plant units and machines and uses that data to create current target schedules. These are then transmitted via Optime as a target figure to the corresponding unit or machine control system of each power plant location.   Sabine Erlinghagen, CEO of Siemens Digital Grid, says “The success of this project hinged on the close cooperation between RWE and Siemens. The new control technology for Europe’s largest trading floor enables Siemens to combine state-of-the-art control software and SCADA tools on a single platform. This helps RWE to better coordinate generation capacities in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. At the same time, high-quality, virtually disruption-free system services can be provided. In the future, it will be possible to optimise the integration of fluctuating levels of renewables-based energy. This holistic approach to power plant management will make a contribution to accelerating the energy transition in Europe and the world.”  ### Downloads    * Press release   * Info graphic \"One-stop shop\"   * Image Real-time control   * Image RWE control system","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","title":"One-stop shop – RWE invests in new control system for power plant dispatch","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Supply & Trading GmbH","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-supply-and-trading\/2020-06-24-RWE-invests-in-new-control-system-for-power-plant","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-supply-and-trading\/2020\/2020-06-24-one-stop-shopping-RWE-invests-in-new-control-system-for-power-plant-dispatch.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":8620,"text":"Coal phase-out regulated by law after two years    * Regulations provide clarity for the company and its employees   * Decommissioning of the first lignite-fired power plant unit already this year   * Prompt signing of the public law contract and regulations for adjustment allowance ‘Anpassungsgeld’ necessary    ### Essen, 3. July 2020  ”The law passed today is an important step towards implementing the coal phase-out. RWE bears the major burden with regards to the regulations on lignite. We will be decommissioning the first power plant unit already in a few months. It is therefore necessary to sign the public-law contract quickly and to complete the directive on the adjustment allowance for the employees affected in order to create legal certainty and to be able to handle the job losses in a socially acceptable manner.”  ####  Rolf Martin Schmitz, CEO of RWE AG   Today the German parliament ‘Bundestag’ passed the Coal Phase-out Act. The law also passed the German Upper House ‘Bundesrat’ today. The regulations in the law to end the use of lignite by 2038 at the latest mean severe cuts for the company. However, they create the necessary planning security for the company and its employees. Before the end of this year, RWE will shut down the first power plant unit with a capacity of 300 megawatts. Further power plant units with a total capacity of 2,500 MW will follow in the next two years. Until 2030, RWE will shut down two thirds of its lignite-fired capacity and thus bears the major burden of the measures laid down in the decommissioning path for lignite.  The closures also have significant consequences for lignite production. The Inden and Hambach opencast mines will be closed earlier than planned, and the Hambach forest will be retained. Over 1.1 billion tonnes of lignite reserves - more than half of the volumes approved for mining - will remain in the ground. Soon, only the Garzweiler opencast mine will be available to safely supply the remaining power plants and refineries with lignite. The Coal Phase-out Act therefore notes that the Garzweiler opencast mine is necessary for the energy industry in order to ensure security of energy supply against the backdrop of the 2016 guiding decision (‘Leitentscheidung’) of the state of North-Rhine Westphalia. This also includes the well advanced 3rd resettlement phase. The coal under the affected villages will be needed as early as 2024.  RWE has already submitted an adapted area concept (‘Revierkonzept’) to the North Rhine-Westphalian state government to contribute to the preparation of a new guiding decision (‘Leitentscheidung’) for the Rhenish lignite mining area. The company will pay special attention to the social aspects of the people affected. The cushioning of social hardships had also been recommended by the Commission for Growth, Structural Change and Employment (‘KWSB’), representing a broad spectrum of society.   For the considerable burdens that RWE will have to bear as a result of the coal phase-out, the company will receive compensation amounting to €2.6 billion, which will be paid out over the next 15 years. This amount is significantly lower than the actual loss RWE will suffer, which is around €3.5 billion.   As a result of the regulations, more than 3,000 jobs in the lignite-based business will be lost at RWE by the end of 2022; by 2030 the total number of jobs lost will be about 6,000. This will reduce the total number of people employed in the lignite system by over 60% in just 10 years. In this context, it is necessary that the regulations on the adjustment allowance (‘Anpassungsgeld’) and on compensation for any pension disadvantages arising in the statutory pension insurance system be established quickly. The trade unions had vehemently advocated this. In addition, the company will also contribute to the job losses being handled in a socially acceptable manner.   The Coal Phase-out Act also provides a clear framework for hard coal fired power stations. RWE will wait for the concrete tender design to be published and will then investigate options.   Rolf Martin Schmitz underlines: \"The long process was a tremendous emotional burden for RWE employees. Even under those difficult circumstances, they continued to contribute to a secure electricity supply. Now is the time for all social groups represented in the Commission for Growth, Structural Change and Employment to support the responsible implementation of the coal phase-out.\"  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Coal phase-out regulated by law after two years","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2020-07-03-coal-phase-out-regulated-by-law-after-two-years","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-ag\/2020\/2020-07-03-coal-phase-out-regulated-by-law-after-two-years.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":8626,"text":"RWE and Bosch sign long-term solar power purchase agreement    * 16-year 50-megawatt power purchase agreement      * Green electricity goes directly to German Bosch sites      * PPA model ensures construction of new solar farms in southern Germany    ### Essen, 5 August 2020  RWE Supply & Trading will provide Bosch with solar power. The total capacity amounts to 50 megawatts. The company will source the power from several new farms in southern Germany developed by RWE and other providers. These solar farms can be built thanks to the power purchase agreements and thus do not rely on subsidies under the German Renewable Energy Act.  The first delivery will begin shortly, with all of the solar farms slated for commissioning over the course of 2021. RWE Supply & Trading will organise and pool procurement, take charge of structuring, and, in its role as accounting group overseer, integrate all of the green electricity deliveries within the Bosch procurement portfolio. In so doing, RWE will ensure that the power put on the system equals the amount of electricity drawn from the grid simultaneously at all times.  Bosch seeks to be fully carbon neutral by the end of 2020. Its German sites already achieved this goal at the end of 2019. The company intends to significantly increase its renewable energy consumption by 2030. The long-term PV supply agreement with RWE pays into hitting this target and Bosch's strategy.  \"By signing this agreement, we are taking the next step towards implementing Bosch's ambitious climate protection programme,\" emphasises Andree Stracke, Chief Commercial Officer Origination & Gas Supply at RWE Supply & Trading. \"With its global portfolio, RWE ranks among the largest producers of electricity from renewables. We provide tailor-made solutions to industry and municipal utilities, with a view to helping these customers achieve their environmental goals.\"  Long-term power purchase agreements are increasingly becoming an option for operators of both legacy and new renewable energy plants. PPA models have the advantage of not requiring participation in invitations to tender for subsidy tariffs. This increases site flexibility and accelerates project rollout.  RWE Supply & Trading already supplies green energy to key accounts directly via PPAs. For instance, Deutsche Bahn Strom, the German Railway's electricity arm, procures electricity from parts of the Nordsee Ost offshore wind farm. Another example is the Belgian Northwester 2 wind farm, the entire generation of which has been marketed by RWE Supply & Trading since the spring of 2020.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE and Bosch sign long-term solar power  purchase agreement","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Supply & Trading GmbH","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-supply-and-trading\/2020-08-05-rwe-and-bosch-sign-long-term-solar-power-purchase-agreement","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-supply-and-trading\/2020\/2020-08-05-rwe-and-bosch-sign-long-term-solar-power-purchase-agreement.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":8635,"text":"RWE expands its renewables business in the Netherlands    * RWE’s first ground-mounted solar plant with 14 megawatts under construction      * Commissioning planned for 2021    ### Essen, 03 September 2020  “The Netherlands are one of Europe’s core markets for solar energy. That’s why I am delighted that now all traffic lights are green to start the construction of Kerkrade - our first ground-mounted solar farm in the country. This solar farm will be able to supply the equivalent of almost 4,000 Dutch homes with green electricity and will make a substantial contribution to reach the local climate targets.”  ####  Katja Wünschel, COO Wind Onshore & Solar PV Europe & APAC of RWE Renewables   RWE is making good progress in expanding its solar business. Having recently completed the construction of solar farms in the US, Canada and Spain, the company has now started the construction of its first ground mounted solar project in the Netherlands. The solar farm Kerkrade in the Province of Limburg is set to have a capacity of more than 14 megawatts (MW) and will further strengthen RWE’s renewables business in the Netherlands.  The Dutch company Volta Solar is responsible for all construction works as RWE’s service provider. Their team is currently preparing the 12-hectare construction site for the installation of the substructures, which is scheduled to begin in October. The installation of the more than 36,000 solar modules will follow beginning of next year and commissioning of the solar park is planned for early summer 2021.  “We want to build up a substantial solar portfolio in the Netherlands and have already secured further growth opportunities by partnering with local developers, like Volta Solar. In addition we benefit from the market expertise of our well-established onshore wind business and intend to achieve synergies by developing solar parks closely to our onshore assets”, explained Wünschel.  RWE already operates seven onshore wind farms with a total capacity of around 300 MW in the Netherlands, including the Zuidwester wind farm consisting of 12 powerful onshore wind turbines of 7.5 MW each. In addition the company is currently constructing four new onshore wind farms with more than 115 MW total capacity in the country.  In terms of further investments in solar, RWE is actively developing projects in several countries in Europe as well as in North America with a total capacity of more than 5 gigawatts. In Australia RWE is currently building a large-scale solar farm with a 249 MW capacity in New South Wales.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE expands its renewables business in the Netherlands","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2020-09-03-rwe-expands-its-renewables-business-in-the-netherlands","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-renewables\/2020\/2020-09-03-rwe-expands-its-renewables-business-in-the-netherlands.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":8655,"text":"RWE’s innovative electrolysis project Eemshydrogen enters next phase    * RWE intend to supply OCI N.V.'s production facility BioMCN and Evonik with green hydrogen    ### Essen, 6 November 2020  “Green hydrogen offers huge potential for the energy transition and for RWE, as well. We have the know-how and the renewables plants to produce green hydrogen ourselves. And thanks to our energy trading unit, we can operate electrolysers optimally in line with market’s requirements. Hydrogen plays an important role for the decarbonisation of the industry sector, as not all industrial production processes are suitable for electrification. It is important to get the hydrogen economy moving quickly for the Netherlands and Europe to keep the competitive advantage in the global market place. RWE are determined to play an active part in creating a hydrogen economy.”   ####  Roger Miesen, CEO RWE Generation   RWE is developing Eemshydrogen, an innovative project for green hydrogen production at Eemshaven, to demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated hydrogen value chain with vast scaling potential. To contribute to the economic viability of the project, RWE has now signed a letter of intent with OCI N.V.'s production facility BioMCN on the supply of green hydrogen in the future. In addition, RWE intends to provide green hydrogen to Evonik. Both companies in Delfzijl plan to use the green hydrogen in their business processes for making sustainable products. The amount of green hydrogen that RWE will supply to both companies is under evaluation. The conclusion of the agreements is a next step for RWE in the development and realisation of a 50 megawatts electrolyser, directly connected to RWE’s Westereems onshore wind farm in Eemshaven with an installed capacity of 162 MW.  Eemshydrogen is part of the necessary development of scaling up and cost reduction in the production of green hydrogen. The project contributes to the broad investment agenda of the Northern Netherlands for hydrogen, including users in various sectors, infrastructure and large-scale storage. BioMCN, for example, plans to use green hydrogen to produce green methanol, which can be used as a green raw material for chemistry or as an alternative renewable fuel in transport.  About Eemshydrogen  To explore innovations in the hydrogen area RWE started a feasibility study in 2019 aimed at producing green hydrogen in Eemshaven. The resulting Eemshydrogen project is comprised of, in the first phase, the development and realisation of a 50 MW electrolyser in Eemshaven with a direct connection to RWE's Westereems onshore wind farm. Depending on market developments and regulations, the electrolysis capacity can be further scaled up. The green hydrogen produced by the installation can yield more than 250,000 tons of CO2 savings over the project’s lifetime. RWE alongside developers of electrolysers, are evaluating technical options for producing hydrogen in a flexible way, linked to intermittent wind power generation. A final investment decision for the project is expected to be taken in 2021, production of green hydrogen could start in 2024. Furthermore, the Eemshydrogen project contributes to the development of a hydrogen infrastructure in Northern Netherlands by enabling the conversion of electric power into hydrogen. The produced hydrogen can be stored, transported and made available to industrial customers. In addition, the production of hydrogen can contribute to limiting congestion in the electricity network.  RWE active player on hydrogen  In addition to Eemshydrogen, RWE in Germany is working on, among other things, the GET H2 project. This aims to build up the entire hydrogen value chain. In addition, RWE has become a member of the AquaVentus project off the coast of Heligoland in the German North Sea, a concept for the production of hydrogen using offshore wind, with the island as a central hub. RWE’s offshore wind farms on site – Nordsee Ost, Amrumbank West and in the future Kaskasi– are ideal for this. In other countries where RWE is active, options are also being explored. In the United Kingdom, for example, RWE is looking at how hydrogen infrastructures can be used together with partners in the large industrial clusters.  ### Downloads    * Press release   * Infographic","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE’s innovative electrolysis project Eemshydrogen enters next phase","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Generation SE","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-generation\/2020-11-06-rwes-innovative-electrolysis-project-eemshydrogen-enters-next-phase","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-generation-se\/2020\/2020-11-06-rwes-innovative-electrolysis-project-eemshydrogen-enters-next-phase.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The addition of this facility to our operating portfolio is just one example of RWE’s strong focus on the U.S. market and its growing ambition in solar and battery storage. The co-location of a solar plant along with storage provides us flexibility in finding solutions to fulfill the energy requirements of our customers.”   ####  Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, CEO of RWE Renewables   RWE Renewables’ Hickory Park Solar project, a 195.5-megawatt (MWac) facility coupled with a 40 megawatt 2-hour battery storage system, located in Mitchell County, Georgia, is under construction. RWE is the operator and manager of the solar facility, selling the energy and renewable attributes from the facility to Georgia Power through its Renewable Energy Development Initiative program. The project is expected to be online in late 2021.  The company announced in November 2019 it entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Georgia Power Company, an investor owned public utility that serves more than 2.6 million customers.  “We are extremely pleased to have a project of this size in Georgia under construction,” said Silvia Ortin, COO Onshore Wind and Solar PV Americas. “We look forward to working with Georgia Power, a company that’s committed to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to advance solar in Georgia.”  When complete, the Hickory Park solar power plant will interconnect more than 650,000 solar panels, which together will cover an area of about 1,800 acres. The integration of a state-of-the-art DC-coupled storage system will allow the project’s energy yield to be optimized and increase the predictability of injection of locally produced energy into the Georgia Power grid. This demonstrates how RWE is able to propose storage solutions that fit its customers’ needs to integrate more clean energy into the grid.  RWE Renewables aspires to play a major role in energy storage across its target markets, where more than 50 percent of the total global utility scale storage additions are expected. In the US, we are developing a number of storage projects either standalone or co-located with our Solar projects.  The U.S. accounts for more than one third of the RWE Group´s renewables capacity playing a key role in RWE’s strategy to grow its renewables business and to become carbon neutral by 2040. RWE constructs, owns and operates some of the highest performing wind, solar and energy storage projects in the U.S.  In addition to Hickory Park, RWE owns and operates West of the Pecos solar project, a 100 MW (ac) project located in Reeves County, Texas. Furthermore, RWE has significant experience in the U.S. onshore market with more than 4.2 GW (RWE’s pro rata share is about 3.6 GW) of onshore wind. In addition, RWE has at the moment almost 1 GW of onshore wind farms under construction in the U.S. The projects are located in Texas, Oklahoma, Ohio and New York State.  As an established leader in renewables, RWE has recently entered into a joint venture, New England Alpha Ventus, focused on floating offshore wind in the state of Maine.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE’s Hickory Park solar project with co-located storage facility under construction","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2020-11-17-rwes-hickory-park-solar-project-with-co-located-storage-facility-under-construction","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-renewables\/2020\/2020-11-17-rwes-hickory-park-solar-project-with-co-located-storage-facility-under-construction.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":8660,"text":"FUREC project to use waste stream for hydrogen production    * Circular economy at Chemelot Limburg    ### Essen, 19 November 2020  „At RWE, we are working with partners from industry and the scientific community to drive forward more than 30 hydrogen projects in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. RWE is one of the few companies to be involved in projects along the entire hydrogen value chain. For the chemical industry, hydrogen offers great potential for decarbonising the production processes and making them more sustainable. Our FUREC project represents an important step forward as we create a circular hub in the Limburg region and help our industrial partners to lower their carbon footprint.”   ####  Roger Miesen, CEO of RWE Generation   RWE Generation is developing a project to produce hydrogen by using waste stream at industrial park Chemelot in the province of Limburg in the Netherlands. The FUREC project - Fuse Reuse Recycle - will produce hydrogen for the chemical industry and help to make their production processes more sustainable. Waste streams, such as Limburg's residual waste, serve as a substitute for natural gas in the production of hydrogen. The project contributes to the ambition of the local business community, educational facilities and the province to develop Limburg into a circular hub. Furthermore, it aims at setting up a hydrogen link between the Dutch seaports and the German Ruhr area.  The FUREC project plans to transform residual waste into raw material pellets, which are then converted into hydrogen at industrial park Chemelot. This process will reduce the use of natural gas at Chemelot by more than 200 million m3 per year. This is comparable to the annual gas demand of approximately 140,000 households and results in a CO2 reduction of 380,000 tonnes per year. The CO2 released during the production of hydrogen can be either captured and stored or used as a raw material in the future. In addition to local sales at Chemelot, the hydrogen can eventually be transported to industry in Rotterdam and the German Ruhr area.  Ruud Burlet, Provincial Executive of Limburg (Circular Economy, Sustainability, Environment): „This innovative hydrogen project from RWE and Chemelot contributes significantly to our ambition: making Limburg a role model when it comes to the transition to a sustainable future. With the Chemelot Circular Hub, we want to become the first real circular hub in Europe, where sustainable materials and products that people and society are waiting for are developed with the help of green chemistry. There is no such thing as unusable waste. With this revamped chemical industry, we are turning the sustainability transition into a new economic engine for the region.”  Loek Radix, CEO of Chemelot: „Just like Chemelot, RWE attaches great importance to circularity and innovation. The fact that RWE has chosen to produce circular hydrogen at Chemelot makes me enormously proud and is a great compliment to the way in which Chemelot is positioned. This new collaboration fits in perfectly with Chemelot's and the region's ambition to become the first circular hub in Europe.”  Next steps  In the coming period, RWE will further develop the project and start the necessary licensing procedures. The company aims to make a final investment decision in 2022. Discussions on the further details of the project are currently underway. RWE is also looking at Sustainable Multifunctional Business Park Zevenellen (gemeente Leudal) as possible location for converting the waste streams in a closed system into raw materials pellets. RWE is discussing the possible future sale of hydrogen with OCI N.V., which has a production plant at Chemelot. Hydrogen would enable the company to make its production chain more sustainable and contribute to circular food production. The FUREC project is a new and important step in the development and acceleration of the transition to a circular economy in the province and the creation of a sustainable value chain.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"FUREC project to use waste stream for hydrogen production","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Generation SE","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-generation\/2020-11-19-furec-project-to-use-waste-stream-for-hydrogen-production","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-generation-se\/2020\/2020-11-19-furec-project-to-use-waste-stream-for-hydrogen-production.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":8665,"text":"Compensation allocated at hard coal phase-out auction: RWE closes power stations in Hamm and Ibbenbüren    * Affected employees are supported in a socially responsible manner   * RWE underlines its CO2 reduction strategy    ### Essen, 1 December 2020  During the first German auction to decommission hard coal-fired power plants, RWE Generation has been allocated compensation for both the 800 megawatts Unit E of its Westfalen power plant in Hamm and its 800 megawatts Unit B of the Ibbenbüren power plant. This has been announced by the German Federal Network Agency today. As a consequence, RWE will no longer be entitled to market the electricity generated in these plants after December 31 of this year. Subject to the review by the transmission system operators, the last two hard coal-fired power plants of RWE in Germany will be decommissioned. For both plants, with a total net capacity of 1,560 megawatts, the company will receive 216 million euros in line with the awards of the auction.  “This will be a very bitter blow for those employees whose power plant will be shut down at such short notice”, emphasised Roger Miesen, CEO of RWE Generation. “The collective agreement, which was concluded at the end of August, ensures that there will be no forced redundancies and that the shutdown will be carried out in a socially responsible manner”, said Miesen. RWE employs 166 people at the Westfalen power station and 88 at the Ibbenbüren power plant. RWE will now prepare the decommissioning process and the associated personnel measures together with the company's co-determination councils.  With regard to the auction’s result, Miesen said: “We submitted bids for both Westfalen and Ibbenbüren which represent an adequate compensation for the loss of the future value of our power plants. This underlines our CO2 reduction strategy. RWE will be carbon-neutral by 2040. The closure of the plants in Ibbenbüren and Hamm is a further step in this direction.”  Plans for the subsequent use of both sites will be further developed in due course and in consultation with regional stakeholders.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Compensation allocated at hard coal phase-out auction: RWE closes power stations in Hamm and Ibbenbüren","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Generation SE","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-generation\/2020-12-01-compensation-allocated-at-hard-coal-phase-out-auction-rwe-closes-power-stations-in-hamm-and-ibbenbueren","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-generation-se\/2020\/2020-12-01-compensation-allocated-hard-coal-phase-out-auction-rwe-closes-power-stations.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":8666,"text":"New partner for NortH2: RWE strengthens one of the most ambitious hydrogen projects in Europe    * Other project partners are Shell, Equinor, Gasunie and Groningen Seaports   * RWE contributes expertise in offshore wind farms and operation of electrolysers    ### Essen, 7 December 2020  “NortH2 is one of the most ambitious hydrogen projects in Europe. As a new partner, RWE will contribute its broad expertise to create a powerful infrastructure for green hydrogen in Northern Netherlands. We are the world's second biggest operator of offshore wind farms and have experience in the field of electrolysers, making us the ideal partner for NortH2.”   ####  Roger Miesen, CEO of RWE Generation   In February 2020, the NortH2 consortium of companies was launched with the aim of developing a centre for green hydrogen for north-western Europe, based in Northern Netherlands. Partners on the NortH2 project are the energy company Shell, the gas network operator Gasunie and the port of Groningen Seaports. And now RWE. The energy company will contribute its broad expertise in renewables and hydrogen to the project. With Equinor, a further company has joined NortH2.  The NortH2 partners intend to jointly establish a system of offshore wind farms, electrolysers, gas storage and pipelines in order to convert offshore wind power into green hydrogen, store it and transport it to industrial clusters in north-western Europe. The aim is to create a generation capacity of 4 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. NortH2 can thus play an important role in achieving the EU target of installing at least 40 GW of hydrogen electrolysers across Europe by 2030. By 2040, the capacity of NortH2 is expected to grow to over 10 GW - enough to produce 1 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year. This would mitigate 8 to 10 million tonnes of CO2 per year.  Together with its NortH2 partners, RWE is conducting a feasibility study that will last until 2021. Subject to a positive outcome, initial development activities could begin in the second half of 2021.  In RWE, the NortH2 consortium has gained a partner that is positioned along the entire value chain for green hydrogen: RWE Renewables - the world's number two in the field of offshore wind - can supply clean electricity for hydrogen production.  RWE Generation has the know-how to produce green hydrogen. RWE Gas Storage can store hydrogen in its gas storage facilities, and the energy trading company RWE Supply & Trading can supply the fuel to industrial customers in line with their needs.  RWE is already driving forward some 30 projects in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. In the Netherlands, these are Eemshydrogen and FUREC. Eemshydrogen aims to develop a 50 Megawatt (MW) electrolyser in Eemshaven which will help the local chemical industry to decarbonise its processes. FUREC is about producing hydrogen from waste streams in the Limburg region. GET H2 is the largest hydrogen project in Germany. It aims to create the first publicly accessible hydrogen network in the country with scalable industrial production of green hydrogen. Under GET H2, RWE plans to build Germany's largest electrolyser in Lingen, with a capacity of 100 MW. The electrolysis capacity in Lingen can be expanded by 2 GW. RWE is also a member of the AquaVentus project off the coast of Heligoland in the German North Sea. AquaVentus aims to produce hydrogen using offshore wind energy, with the island of Heligoland serving as a central hub.

{"id":8673,"text":"Power Purchase Agreement signed for Humber Gateway Offshore Wind Farm    * E.ON UK to offtake green power production from Humber Gateway for 13 years   * Power Purchase Agreement secures power and ROC offtake until 2035    ### Essen, 15 December 2020  RWE Renewables signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with E.ON UK under which the company will offtake 100% of the electricity produced by the Humber Gateway Offshore Wind Farm from 2022 until 2035. This includes the Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) from the plant. The contract directly follows on from the previous agreement to supply E.ON UK’s customers with green electricity from the offshore wind farm, and which is due to end in 2022.  Tom Glover, RWE Renewables Chief Commercial Officer and UK Country Chair: “As one of the world’s leading renewable energy companies, we are committed to dedicating our energy for a sustainable life. The UK plays a key role in RWE’s strategy to grow its renewables business and to become carbon neutral by 2040. With the signing of the PPA with E.ON UK we demonstrate our ability to support electricity suppliers in providing CO2-free power to their customers.”   Michael Lewis, E.ON UK Chief Executive: “We're fully committed to combating the climate crisis and helping the UK meet its net zero targets. Part of that is providing our customers with smart, personalised and sustainable solutions and this agreement with RWE secures yet another significant contribution to the 100% renewable electricity1 we provide to millions of customers around the country as a first step in that journey.“  Humber Gateway is located in the United Kingdom, off the coast of East Yorkshire and was commissioned in 2015. With an installed capacity of 219 megawatts (MW), the wind farm is capable of supplying green electricity equivalent to the annual average demand of almost 300,000 UK homes2. RWE recently divested a 49% stake in Humber Gateway to Greencoat. With a 51% share in the plant, RWE continues to operate the wind farm.  In the United Kingdom, RWE is currently constructing the Triton Knoll offshore wind farm and is developing the Sofia offshore project, both of which will expand RWE’s current UK portfolio of nine offshore wind farms. In addition, RWE recently signed Agreements for Lease with The Crown Estate to develop extension projects at four offshore wind farms.  The company also has a significant footprint in the UK onshore market. By the end of 2022, RWE aims to expand its renewables portfolio to more than 13 gigawatts capacity by investing €5 billion net. Together with partners, the gross investment volume can amount to up to €9 billion. To achieve its growth targets, RWE has an attractive project development pipeline of more than 22 gigawatts, across all of the company’s strategic core regions.  E.ON is committed to being carbon neutral itself by 2040 and offers 100% renewable electricity for its 3.4 million customers’ homes as standard2. E.ON also offers smart meters, energy efficient boilers and solar and battery technology which can all help people better manage their home energy use.  * * *  1 Electricity backed by 100% renewable sources.

{"id":8677,"text":"Coal Phase-out Act: RWE Power takes first plant off grid – Unit D in Niederaussem  In the picture (f.l.): Werner Kratzer; Hermann-Josef Abts, Friedrich Plötz, Dustin Curtis Goncz, Thomas Sporr, Jürgen Esser    * Further annual saving of 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 in lignite   * Operations end at midnight on 31 December \/ More than 115 billion kWh electricity generated in total    ### Essen\/Cologne, 30 December 2020  “Decommissioning this power station unit at Niederaussem is a difficult step, especially for our employees who are involved there, even if they agree with the need to protect the climate and with the legally mandated exit from coal. We will do all we can to support the path to decommissioning in accordance with the law, and at the same time do our part to help achieve the energy transition. Decommissioning this unit is also a further step forward in implementing our rigorous CO2 reduction strategy. By 2040, RWE will be carbon neutral and will end electricity production based on lignite by 2038.”   ####  Dr Frank Weigand, CEO RWE Power   From 31 December 2020, RWE Power will decommission the 300-megawatt Unit D at its Niederaussem lignite power station. Decommissioning this unit forms part of the process of exiting from coal, initiated by Germany’s Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment in 2019 and codified by both houses of the German parliament this summer in the Coal-fired Power Generation Termination Act (Kohleverstromungsbeendigungsgesetz).   Decommissioning Unit D will mean a loss of about 300 jobs in the overall lignite process chain from sourcing the raw material in opencast mines to operating and maintaining the power station. By the end of 2022, by which time RWE will have taken 2.8 gigawatts of power station capacity out of the system, this figure will rise to about 3,000 jobs. By 2030, as much as two-thirds of RWE’s lignite-based power station capacity will have been decommissioned, affecting 6,000 jobs in total. The collective agreement concluded at the end of August will ensure there are no redundancies, and that the decommissioning process will be socially cushioned.   During the first few years of the process, RWE will bear the brunt of the exit from lignite in Germany. In addition, RWE will terminate hard-coal generation in Germany on 31 December after winning the tender at the first nationwide decommissioning auction for hard-coal power plants for the 800-megawatt Unit E at Kraftwerk Westfalen power station in Hamm and the 800-megawatt Unit B at Kraftwerk Ibbenbüren power station. At the same time, the company is continuing to push ahead with the expansion of renewable energies.   “The fact Unit D has operated reliably in generating electricity for so many years is down to professional management and a well thought-out and successful maintenance programme – and thus also the commitment by the entire team,” emphasises RWE Power management board member Dr Lars Kulik.   Since it was first put into service on 1 May 1968, Unit D has operated for 390,000 hours and generated more than 115 billion kilowatt hours of electricity using 129 million tonnes of lignite. In purely arithmetic terms, that would be enough to supply all electricity consumers in Düsseldorf for almost 30 years. Decommissioning the unit will result in a reduction in carbon emissions of about 2.5 million tonnes per year.  Effective October 2019, five other 300 MW units belonging to RWE have been out of full-time operation but have each been retained on standby for a four-year period. Depending on when the standby arrangement began in each case, these will be definitively decommissioned in October 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively.   ### Downloads    * Press release   * Press picture","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Coal Phase-out Act: RWE Power takes first plant off grid","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Power AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-power\/2020-12-30-coal-phase-out-act-rwe-power-takes-first-plant-off-grid","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-power-ag\/2020\/2020-12-30-coal-exit-rwe-power-takes-first-plant-off-grid.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":8678,"text":"Bedburg A 44n – next new wind farm on former opencast mining site    * 28.5-megawatt wind farm is joint venture with the City of Bedburg   * Construction to commence in spring – commissioning early 2022    ### Essen, 8 January 2021  RWE is planning to commence construction of another wind farm on a recultivated opencast mining site as early as next spring, after the company was successful at the latest German auction for onshore wind farms. The future “Bedburg A 44n” wind farm will be situated on a recultivated former opencast mining site near the new motorway section of the same name. There, five Nordex wind turbines with an installed capacity of 5.7 megawatts each and a hub height of 164 metres will be erected over the coming months. They are due to be commissioned early in 2022.  Just like nearby Königshovener Höhe wind farm (67.2 MW), the Bedburg A 44n project is a joint venture of RWE Renewables (51%) with the City of Bedburg (49%).  Four of the wind turbines will feed electricity into the grid using the existing RWE Power infrastructure at the Garzweiler opencast mine.  The fifth wind turbine will provide electricity into the grid via the Bedburg-Kaster resource conservation village, which is currently under construction. This is a housing project of 130 units with an innovative energy, architecture and urban development concept. The project is another joint venture between the City of Bedburg and RWE, with additional partners, including E.ON, Westnetz and the Faktor-X agency; it is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy programme “Regulatory Sandboxes for the Energy Transition”.   The planners’ vision is to use part of the electricity produced by the fifth turbine at Bedburg 44n wind farm to supply the resource conservation village with the help of an energy storage system, with the remainder feeding into the grid system.   Katja Wünschel, COO Wind Onshore & Solar PV Europe & APAC of RWE Renewables: “RWE is building yet another wind farm on a former opencast mining site. This is already the sixth one in the Rhenish mining district, where we will soon reach an installed wind power capacity of 200 megawatts. With this latest investment we are also taking another step towards implementing our ambitious strategy for reducing carbon emissions. By 2040, RWE as a whole will be carbon neutral.”  Sascha Solbach, Mayor of Bedburg: “The Rhenish mining district is in an excellent position to remain an energy-producing region – with conventional energy sources being phased out and renewables being expanded in the area. Energy transition and structural change will be more successful if we skillfully connect the different sectors to each other. In this region, our windfarm is the central link. And once we can link up the new wind farm and our resource conservation village, we will be leading the way in energy storage, distribution and utilisation here in Bedburg.”  RWE is expanding its onshore portfolio  RWE already operates onshore wind parks with a total installed capacity of approximately 650 MW in Germany. Currently, the company is constructing the Jüchen A44n cooperative wind farm (27 MW) in collaboration with NEW Re and the City of Jüchen. Six wind turbines are being erected on recultivated land, which was previously part of the Garzweiler opencast mine. Commissioning is planned for spring. RWE is also continuously expanding its international wind portfolio of more than 6 gigawatts (GW). In addition to the domestic market in Germany, the company is currently constructing onshore wind farms in the US, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Italy and the UK.

It is located in the Centre-Val de Loire region, 250 km south of Paris. The three remaining projects are the 18 MW “Les Hauts Bouleaux”, the 15 MW “Martinpuich” wind farm in the north of France and the 17 MW onshore wind farm “Rozdrazew”, located in Poland, 80 km south-east of Poznan.  All these projects arose from the purchase of the European onshore wind and solar development business of Nordex SE, which RWE acquired in November 2020. This acquisition added a further 2.7 gigawatts (GW) in France, Spain, Sweden and Poland to RWE’s existing 22 GW development pipeline. The bulk of the new portfolio – 1.9 GW – is based in France. The development business also included a team of more than 70 employees with extensive experience in this area, which is now part of RWE Renewables.  RWE is one of the world’s leading renewables companies. By the end of 2022, the company aims to expand its portfolio to a net capacity of more than 13 gigawatts, involving an investment of €5 billion net; together with partners, the gross investment volume can amount up to €9 billion. The expansion is focused on North America, its core markets in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE expands market presence in France and Poland: Construction of four onshore wind farms ","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2021-01-14-rwe-expands-market-presence-in-france-and-poland-construction-of-four-onshore-wind-farms","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-renewables\/2021\/2021-01-14-rwe-expands-market-presence-in-france-and-poland-construction-of-four-onshore-wind-farms.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The issuance met with strong interest on the market and was more than three times oversubscribed.  As stated in the RWE Green Bond Framework, only wind and solar projects are eligible for green bond funding. This is in line with the United Nations’ Sustainability Goal number 7 to increase the share of renewable energies in the worldwide electricity mix. In addition, RWE’s framework is based on the internationally recognised Green Bond principles of the International Capital Market Association (ICMA). Furthermore, a second party opinion has been issued from the internationally renowned sustainability agency Sustainalytics.  The green bond proceeds are to be allocated to eligible RWE renewable energy projects by the end of the year. The company currently has projects with a total installed capacity of 3.7 gigawatts under construction, which are contributing towards RWE’s aim to expand its portfolio of wind power and solar plants to over 13 gigawatts of net capacity by the end of 2022.   RWE’s first green bond expands the company’s portfolio of sustainable financial instruments. These include the linking of the longer-term tranche of the syndicated credit line to ESG criteria, the existing project financing for the Triton Knoll offshore wind farm and tax equity financing for wind farms in the U.S.  Bookrunners for the issuance were BBVA, Citi, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale as well as Intesa Sanpaolo, LBBW and SMBC.   ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE successfully issues €500 million green bond ","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2021-06-01-RWE-successfully-issues-€500-million-green-bond","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-ag\/2021\/2021-06-01-RWE-successfully-issues-green-bond.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":8743,"text":"The end of an era: RWE hard-coal power stations in Hamm and Ibbenbüren to be completely decommissioned  RWE hard-coal power station in Ibbenbüren     * RWE’s exit from hard-coal in Germany will then be finished   * Decommissioning underlines CO2 reduction strategy \/ RWE’s goal: climate-neutrality by 2040     ### Essen, 8 July 2021  “For our company, today marks the end of the era of hard-coal generation in Germany. This is another important step for RWE towards climate-neutrality by 2040. We are rigorously pursuing this goal while also taking responsibility for our colleagues at both locations. Respect and thanks go to them. Shift by shift, they have worked hard as a team for a reliable supply of electricity in Germany.”   ####  Roger Miesen, CEO of RWE Generation   During the night from 7 to 8 July, the preparedness phase for RWE’s last two hard-coal-fired power stations in Germany came to an end. At the Westfalen in Hamm and Ibbenbüren locations, the last units will be decommissioned. For RWE, this signals the end of the era of hard-coal power generation in Germany.   In December 2020, in the first nationwide decommissioning auction for hard-coal power stations, RWE Generation had received the tenders both for the 800-megawatt Block E at the Westfalen power station as well as for the 800-megawatt Block B at Ibbenbüren power station. As a result, since the beginning of this year, RWE has no longer been allowed to sell electricity from these stations. As part of a mandatory six-month preparedness phase, the Westfalen station went online 13 times for reasons of security of supply on the request of the transmission system operator. Now this phase has also ended and from 8 July no more coal may be fired at either of these two locations. The decommissioning of the hard-coal units is a further important step towards climate-neutrality, which RWE will achieve by 2040.  “In our plans, it was always particularly important to handle the staff reductions in a socially responsible manner. We want to ensure that the affected colleagues move from gainful employment into gainful employment and will see to it that no one is left behind”, said Hartmut Frank, Head of the Westfalen and Ibbenbüren power stations.  Leonhard Zubrowski, works council chair at RWE Generation, emphasised: “Even though the decision has been public since December, these are difficult days again for the workforce at the two locations. It is all the more important, therefore, that all staff are offered prospects as soon as possible. In this context, the fact that we completed the regulations for socially responsible staff reductions at an early stage is paying off. In this way, those affected can be provided with clarity about their future as quickly as possible. I would like to thank all my colleagues for their great dedication. With their knowledge and years of experience, they have ensured that the plants were always ready to go when they were needed and thus contributed to the secure supply of electricity.\" Since they were commissioned, the two units have produced a total of 158 billion kilowatt hours of electricity – enough to supply the equivalent of 35 million private households with electrical energy for one whole year.  The Westfalen site will continue to make an important contribution towards the energy transition, since the Federal Network Agency has categorised it as systemically relevant. The generator of Block E is to be repurposed as a rotating phase shifter and will provide reactive power for voltage stability – an important service for stabilising the electricity grid. This has no effect on RWE's carbon footprint, as no coal is burned to operate a phase shifter. Unit B of the Ibbenbüren power plant was not classified as systemically relevant by the Federal Network Agency, so the decommissioning of the power plant is now beginning.   RWE is consistently phasing out coal: In the UK and Germany, there are no longer any hard coal-fired power plants in operation, and in the Netherlands the conversion of two plants to biomass is progressing. In the Rhenish lignite mining region, RWE already shut down the first unit at the end of 2020 – as stipulated in the coal phase-out law. Further units will follow in the next 18 months, so that by the end of 2022 a power plant capacity of 2.8 gigawatts will have been shut down. By 2030, a total of two-thirds of RWE's lignite-fired power plant capacity will have been taken off the grid. This is associated with the reduction of about 6,000 jobs, which will be carried out in a socially responsible manner. At the same time, the company is rigorously pushing ahead with the expansion of renewable energies. Today, RWE is already one of the world's largest producers of green electricity.

{"id":8745,"text":"Herculean task and huge opportunity: “Fit for 55” brings together climate protection and industrial policy    * European Commission package creates important stimuli for the energy supply system: Raising expansion targets for renewables, incentives for green hydrogen, emissions trading as market-based key tool      * Package sets the right course – constructive debate needed on details and pace of implementation     ### Essen, 14 July 2021  “Today is a good day for climate protection in Europe. The ”Fit for 55 package” creates new opportunities to really increase the pace of the ramp-up of renewables and get the hydrogen economy moving. At the same time, it strengthens the importance of the Emissions Trading Scheme as market-based key tool. Interlinking climate protection and industrial policy makes it possible to maintain jobs and prosperity of society. Now, the task for the EU and its member states is to take action along the set course.”   ####  Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE AG   The European Commission presented its “Fit for 55” package today. The measures contained aim at aligning climate and energy-policy legislation to the new net reduction target of 55 per cent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. As the centrepiece of the European Green Deal, it brings together climate and industrial policy challenges. RWE also considers this to be the right approach.  The focus for RWE is on three aspects in particular:  Expansion of renewables  Green electricity is the basis for the transformation towards a climate-neutral Europe. The huge expansion in wind turbines and solar power plants therefore is paramount for the sustainable electrification of society. Thus, raising the EU expansion target to minimum 40 percent by 2030 is a logical step. But for Europe to really become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, the expansion needs to be even faster. Besides reliable investment conditions in the member states in particular, faster approval processes are needed that will foster and speed up the expansion. The EU framework has long advocated much shorter and leaner procedures.  Incentives for green hydrogen  Green hydrogen is the key to decarbonising industrial production processes. The “Fit for 55” package creates investment incentives that will favour a swift market development. The new goals for the use of renewables in sectors such as transport and industry will also intensify demand for green hydrogen. It is helpful that carbon contracts for difference, aimed at driving hydrogen growth, can be financed via the ETS Innovation Fund.  As soon as possible, more clarity is needed regarding the regulation of hydrogen infrastructure, certification and proof of origin for climate-neutral gases.  The criteria for procuring renewable electricity to create green hydrogen laid out in the Renewables Directive should follow a pragmatic approach in order not to endanger the fast market ramp-up.  Stronger emissions trading and a competitive industry  It is good that the Commission puts further emphasis on the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), thus making it the market-based key tool for EU climate policy for the long term. Minimum prices for CO2 are not necessary if the ETS is adjusted in a clever way. The positive experiences with the ETS are used to establish a separate emissions trading scheme for transportation and buildings, in order to ensure targets will also be achieved in these sectors.  The wide range of regulations of the “Fit for 55” package presents Europe with a herculean task but offers huge opportunities at the same time. It will be paramount to combine the individual elements in a way that will avoid a “patchwork” effect. Europe needs a solid foundation that will create a climate for investments and innovation to maintain the Union’s leading position in terms of international competitiveness.  Many of the approaches in the package stimulate cross-border collaboration within Europe. With this framework in place, Europe can set standards and an example that others will follow. In global competition, successful international climate diplomacy is therefore preferable to risky isolation measures such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).  European industry should receive support for the conversion to climate-friendly production respectively CO2 allowances should continue to be allocated at no cost until a level playing field for carbon costs is achieved.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Herculean task and huge opportunity: “Fit for 55” brings together climate protection and industrial policy","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2021-07-14-fit-for-55-brings-together-climate-protection-and-industrial-policy","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-ag\/2021\/2021-07-14-fit-for-55-brings-together-climate-protection-and-industrial-policy.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":8746,"text":"RenewableUK unveils new Directors in latest Board election results    * RWE’s Alice Barrs, Head of UK Policy and Public Affairs elected to board   * Board of Directors plays a crucial role in setting the agenda for RenewableUK    ### UK, 14 July 2021  RenewableUK has announced the results of the association’s latest annual Board election, including two new members and one who has been re-elected.  The Board of Directors supports RenewableUK’s senior management team in formulating strategy and setting priorities for the association, as well as ensuring that targets are successfully achieved.

{"id":8755,"text":"RWE forges ahead with growth in renewables business and presents good half-year results    * Gross capital expenditure in renewable energies in first half of 2021 doubles year on year, totalling €1.8 billion       * Portfolio of wind farms and solar plants as well as storage systems to grow to more than 13 gigawatts by end of 2022; 3.9 gigawatts currently under construction with commissioning planned by end of 2022      * Outlook for fiscal 2021 raised significantly on account of exceptionally strong performance by Supply & Trading      * Adjusted EBITDA at previous year’s level of around €1.8 billion despite weather effects – adjusted net income up year on year at €870 million     ### Essen, 12 August 2021  “The transformation of RWE is progressing swiftly. In the first half of the year we invested €1.8 billion gross in renewables, which was twice as much as in the first six months of 2020. And we are continuing full speed ahead. This year we will commission new wind farms and solar plants as well as storage systems with 1.8 gigawatts, with a further 2.1 gigawatts to follow next year. This will take us to our target of more than 13 gigawatts by the end of 2022. Financially, we are also doing well. We have therefore significantly raised our 2021 earnings forecast. ”   ####  Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE AG   The transformation of RWE is continuing at a fast pace. During the first six months of 2021, the company invested €1.8 billion gross in new wind farms and solar plants as well as battery projects. That’s twice as much as in the same period last year. RWE currently has projects amounting to 3.9 gigawatts (GW) under construction, which will be commissioned by the end of 2022. Thus, the portfolio will grow from 9.3 GW today to more than 13 GW by the end of 2022. In addition, RWE has started construction on the 1.4-GW offshore wind farm Sofia off the British coast, which is scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of 2026.  Financially, the first half of 2021 was also very good. On the back of an exceptionally high earnings contribution by Supply & Trading, RWE has significantly increased its outlook for fiscal 2021.  Leading in the development of new solutions  RWE is forging ahead with state-of-the-art technologies like floating offshore, floating solar and storage. As one of the key players in setting up the hydrogen economy, RWE is working with partners on more than 30 projects along the value chain.  Another important element in the transformation of RWE is the rigorous phaseout of coal. The company’s last two hard coal-fired power stations in Germany have been decommissioned. For lignite, the first wave of decommissioning is in progress: At the end of the year, three more units in the Rhenish region will be taken off the grid. As a consequence of the phaseout of coal, RWE will have to cut over 3,000 jobs by the end of 2022 alone. This will be done in a socially responsible way and in close consultation with the social partners.  Extraordinarily strong result in Supply & Trading offsets weather effects  Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) of RWE Group in the first half of 2021 was on the previous year’s level, at €1,751 million (1st half of 2020: €1,833 million). The same applies to adjusted EBIT, at €1,042 million (1st half of 2020: €1,113 million). Adjusted net income was up year-on-year, at €870 million (1st half of 2020: €816 million).  For fiscal 2021, RWE now expects to achieve adjusted EBITDA of between €3.0 billion and €3.4 billion at Group level, which is €350 million higher than forecast in March 2021. In the core business, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between €2.15 billion and €2.55 billion. The range for adjusted EBIT was raised to €1.5 billion to €1.9 billion. RWE now expects its adjusted net income to be between €1.05 billion and €1.4 billion, an increase of €300 million. The dividend statement is confirmed: For the current financial year, the company still aims to increase the dividend to €0.90 per share.  In its core business with the Offshore Wind, Onshore Wind\/Solar, Hydro\/Biomass\/Gas and Supply & Trading segments, RWE achieved adjusted EBITDA of €1,206 million in the first six months of 2021. The figure for the same period last year was €1,523 million.  Offshore Wind: Adjusted EBITDA in the Offshore Wind segment was €459 million for the first half of the year, compared to €585 million for the same period in the previous year. This was because wind volumes were much lower in Northern and Central Europe than the very high level witnessed a year before. For the current year, RWE expects adjusted EBITDA of between €1,050 million and €1,250 million for this segment.  Onshore Wind\/Solar: In the first six months of 2021, the Onshore Wind\/Solar segment recorded adjusted EBITDA of minus €42 million, compared to €299 million in the same period in 2020. The extreme cold snap in Texas led to an earnings shortfall of around €400 million. Additional burdens resulted from below-average wind conditions at onshore wind farm locations in Northern and Central Europe.  Book gains from the sale of RWE’s shares in three US onshore wind farms and earnings contributions from new plants had a positive effect. For the current year, RWE expects adjusted EBITDA of between €50 million and €250 million for this segment.  Hydro\/Biomass\/Gas: With adjusted EBITDA of €297 million, business in the Hydro\/Biomass\/Gas segment was below the previous year’s level of €324 million. The wood pellet production business in the US, which was sold in mid-2020, stopped contributing to earnings. In addition, earnings from electricity produced using biomass in the Netherlands fluctuate during the year. However, RWE expects to achieve higher income from biomass usage for the year as a whole. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment should lie in a range between €500 million and €600 million.  Supply & Trading: The Supply & Trading business once again recorded an outstanding performance. Adjusted EBITDA reached €525 million, exceeding the already high level of €322 million achieved last year. For this segment, therefore, RWE has raised its outlook and now expects adjusted EBITDA to be significantly above €350 million for 2021 as a whole.  Non-core business result in line with expectations  Adjusted EBITDA in the Coal\/Nuclear segment was €545 million, compared to €310 million for the same period in the previous year. For electricity from lignite and nuclear power, RWE realised higher wholesale margins than in 2020. For the year as a whole, it continues to expect adjusted EBITDA of between €800 million and €900 million for this segment.  Comfortable financial situation  The Group’s net debt decreased to €903 million (31 December 2020: €4,432 million). This was due mainly to a very good adjusted operating cash flow and timing effects from hedging activities as well as a decline in pension provisions resulting from higher discount rates.  Michael Müller, CFO of RWE AG, comments: “We posted a better business performance than we expected at the start of the year, which is very gratifying. Our financial situation remains good, and it enables us to maintain our high pace of investment. We will present our plans for beyond 2022 at our Capital Market Day on 15 November 2021.”  ### Downloads    * Press release   * All informationen about the press conference call   * Press conference call speech of Markus Krebber and Michael Müller","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE forges ahead with growth in renewables business and presents good half-year results","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2021-08-12-rwe-forges-ahead-with-growth-in-renewables-business-and-presents-good-half-year-results","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-ag\/2021\/2021-08-12-rwe-forges-ahead-with-growth-in-renewables-business-and-presents-good-half-year-results.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

E.ON, Evonik, RWE, thyssenkrupp and Vonovia have joined forces with the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion, the RWI – Leibniz Institute for Economic Research and the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach-Foundation to accelerate the green transformation on the Rhine and Ruhr. A cross-sectoral future plan for a model hydrogen region is to be developed in a joint project. The aim is to connect pioneering solutions from industry, the energy sector, mobility and housing in order to make the Ruhr a pioneering region for a successful energy transformation.  Our aim: The Ruhr region is to become the industrial, residential and living area with CO2-free hydrogen in Germany and thus set standards for a hydrogen economy in industrial conurbations. The project is intended to lay the groundwork for the necessary planning for infrastructure and production.  Our task: The transformation of one of Germany's largest industrial core regions such as the Ruhr, home to 6.2 percent of the country's population, is a considerable challenge. It requires determining the cross-sectoral hydrogen demand, measuring the expansion of renewable energies or alternative hydrogen imports required for this purpose, and identifying the necessary transport infrastructure. The data collected will be used to create a roadmap that can be used to optimally align coordinated infrastructure investments with private sector investment cycles. Such a roadmap is a prerequisite for creating planning security for all parties involved and for making the region an attractive investment location. No other German region has a better starting position to solve this task: With unique connections across all sectors, synergies in generation, storage, distribution and consumption can be leveraged in the Ruhr region. The conditions for developing a comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure are ideal.  Our aspiration: We want the Ruhr region to become a leading model hydrogen region – with a holistic, cross-sectoral development plan for hydrogen production and infrastructure. The project aims to map out the transformation in concrete terms and launch pilot projects that will provide at least 50 percent of the hydrogen required in the region with low greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. As a result, the project is expected to contribute significantly and rapidly to the reduction of CO2 emissions in the Ruhr region, while maintaining it as an efficient industrial region.  Our partners: Integrated planning that can make the Ruhr a pioneer of the hydrogen economy needs scientific expertise and committed companies with the will to shape and transform. However, it also needs political support from the federal and state governments in order to lay the foundations for an accelerated green transformation of the Ruhr region as a unique ecosystem\/network.  Prof. Dr. Dr. h. c. Ursula Gather, Chairwoman of the Board of Trustees of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach-Foundation: \"The green transformation can only succeed at scale through innovation across value chains. This is because the scale of the challenges is too great to solve alone. New innovation ecosystems are needed to help achieve a breakthrough in the energy transformation and climate neutrality. However, such an ecosystem can only be successful if players from different areas of society, such as industry and research, work together in a well-moderated manner. In this respect, the Ruhr region is best placed for shaping the green transformation successfully and to drive forward the energy transformation for Germany.\"  Leo Birnbaum, Chairman of the Board of Management of E.ON S.E.: \"By 2030, we as a company aim to reduce our CO2 emissions by 65 percent. We have 9 years or just over 100 months to fundamentally change our energy system and build up locally generated and green energy. For E.ON, this means building up the electricity and hydrogen infrastructure at record speed and developing efficient systems to combine the electricity, hydrogen and heat sectors intelligently. The future of our economy, our prosperity and the preservation of the environment will depend on its success.\"  Christian Kullmann, Chairman of the Executive Board of Evonik Industries AG: \"Green hydrogen will continue to be in short supply for years to come. We must therefore set priorities and use it where we can achieve the greatest climate protection effect. So far, everyone is just optimizing their own area of activity. With cross-sectoral cooperation, we will create synergies and reduce the overall demand for green electricity and green energy sources. An efficient allocation of resources can only be achieved by working together.\"  Prof. Dr. Robert Schlögl, founding Director at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion: \"A key challenge for climate neutrality in industry is the rapid conversion of established fossil value chains to new resources and energy sources such as hydrogen and renewables. However, this progress is fundamentally determined by the limited access to these resources. Overarching coordination will greatly accelerate the overall transformation to green products, make it more plannable for everyone, and most importantly, efficient.\"  Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE AG: \"There is no alternative to green power and hydrogen for the decarbonization of many industries. We in the Ruhr region are best placed to become pioneers: Strong companies, well trained and motivated employees and now also a strong partnership. RWE is contributing its entire expertise in this area. If we work together to keep the pace up, we can make the region a winner.\"  Prof. Dr. Dr. h. c. Christoph M. Schmidt, President of RWI – Leibniz Institute for Economic Research: \"The Ruhr region is particularly suitable as a model region because all the sectors relevant to the green transformation are present here, close together and in many cases operate with one another. For a successful transformation, it is not enough for each individual to optimize their processes. Rather, the transformation must be thought out systemically and designed in a coordinated manner. Scientific expertise can contribute to this.\"  Martina Merz, Chair of the Executive Board of thyssenkrupp AG: \"The Ruhr region occupies a prominent position in the green transformation. The unique linking of different sectors and industries makes it possible to think and shape all facets of the energy transformation along the entire hydrogen value chain. It is important to understand CO2-free produced hydrogen as a commodity and to think the transformation through from the end. That is the only way we will be able to develop a suitable infrastructure quickly enough.\"  Rolf Buch, CEO of Vonovia SE: \"The next German government will have the topics of climate protection, hydrogen and renewable energy high on its list of priorities, because the energy transformation can only be successfully shaped with a mix of different energy systems and technologies. Hydrogen will play an important role in this. A major challenge for all those involved lies in the economic and socially compatible integration of hydrogen,\" explained Rolf Buch, CEO of Vonovia SE. In this context Buch, who is currently also the moderator of the Initiativkreis Ruhr (Ruhr Initiative Group), underlined the innovative strength of the Ruhr region as a business location. \"With the hydrogen initiative, we are making an offer to society and government for an accelerated introduction and use of hydrogen. This strong and proud region could become a pioneer in the decarbonization of industry and thus make a decisive contribution to climate protection. The fact that different sectors and industries are linked together is unique and makes a holistic energy transformation possible. The Ruhr could provide an impetus for the whole country.\"  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"New initiative for Ruhr area as a pioneer region of the hydrogen economy","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2021-09-02-new-initiative-for-ruhr-area-as-a-pioneer-region-of-the-hydrogen-economy","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-ag\/2021\/2021-09-02-collabaration-for-ruhr-area-as-a-pioneer-region-of-the-hydrogen-economy.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

RWE is one of the leading companies in renewable energies and is fully committed to supporting the Race to Zero Campaign. We see the UK as an attractive location for ongoing investments, which presents a stable regulatory framework and has great natural wind resources. In line with this, RWE is already the UK’s second largest generator and is investing some £5billion in two of our flagship offshore wind projects. With an ambitious pipeline of growth opportunities across our fleet which includes the UK’s largest offshore development pipeline, we have the potential to increase that overall investment of around £15billion by 2030.”   ####  Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE AG   RWE strives to play a key role in helping achieve net zero ambitions in the UK, one of its most strategically important markets, as business leaders join the Global Investment Summit in London today. RWE AG CEO Markus Krebber is taking part in the government-led summit, which brings together leaders of the UK’s most significant investors in order to encourage further investment into UK green growth initiatives.  RWE is a leader in renewable energies in the UK, having pioneered both onshore and offshore wind over more than 20 years. It is also one of the largest providers of firm flexible generation, which is crucial for security of supply. The company already operates 3.7gigawatts (GW) of wind capacity (RWE share 2.1GW) and around 7GW of modern and efficient gas-fired capacity in the UK.   Much of RWE’s current investment is focused on offshore wind. With partners, RWE is investing around £5 billion into two UK offshore wind farms alone - Triton Knoll and Sofia Offshore Wind Farm. Both projects expect to channel 50% and 60% respectively of their total investments into UK suppliers. Over the next decade, RWE is also looking to accelerate its deployment of wind power across the UK. It is currently developing four new offshore wind farms, which represent a combined potential installed capacity of around 2.6 GW (RWE’s pro rata share 1.3 GW), and is preferred bidder for two new adjacent offshore sites on Dogger Bank (potential installed capacity of 3 GW).  RWE is also developing a portfolio of new onshore wind whilst pursuing floating wind ambitions in Scotland and in the Celtic Sea, off the coast of South West Wales. Finally, the company is developing new battery storage solutions and exploring the broader decarbonisation of its Pembroke Power Station through new hydrogen initiatives, and options for CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) within its gas fleet.  Overall, and including its committed investments in projects already under construction, RWE expects to invest around £15billion in new green technologies and infrastructure in the UK by 2030.  RWE is investing in total more than 90 percent of its capital in sustainable technologies as e.g. renewables energies or batteries. It is targeting investments worldwide of €5 billion net from 2020 until 2022 in order to grow its net capacity of wind and solar to more than 13 gigawatts by the end of 2022.  Across its entire portfolio, RWE’s green growth investments represent a significant boost to the local, regional and national supply chain, and to the local communities with whom the company is committed to working alongside. Through its investments in new renewable energies, hydrogen and storage technologies, RWE represents a major opportunity for UK clean energy and supply chain growth. The company is also supporting the development of high skilled, well-paid jobs, especially in priority coastal communities, training in skills and apprenticeships, and is encouraging employees new to the renewables sector and those transitioning across from other industries such as oil and gas.  Markus Krebber underlined: “RWE has expertise in supplying clean energy and has over 2,600 dedicated people working in our teams across the UK, in renewables, our gas-fired plants, and our commercial supply and trading teams. Our teams are fully committed to RWE’s goals of sustainability and becoming net zero by 2040. Through our experience of investing in pioneering energies around the world, and providing stable and secure energy supply, we have the scale and experience to be a key partner in helping power the nation and we are here for the long haul.”  Pictures of Markus Krebber for media use (credit: RWE) are available at the RWE Media Centre  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE targets £multi-billion investments by 2030 to deliver UK net zero ambitions","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2021-10-19-rwe-targets-multi-billion-investments-to-deliver-uk-net-zero-ambitions","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-renewables\/2021\/2021-10-19-rwe-targets-multi-billion-investments-to-deliver-uk-net-zero-ambitions.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

October 2021  “We are proud to be building Oostpolderdijk Wind Farm as the first of its kind worldwide with wind turbines on a sea dike dam. We are committed to bringing innovations forward like this, in order to further broaden and expand the opportunities in the field of sustainable electricity production. By combining knowledge, innovation and determination, we have added a new function to a sea dike dam in the Netherlands. The experience we gain from this project will be market leading, and will potentially open up further opportunities to build wind farms on dikes in other locations too. And of course: Safety and the integrity of the dike are our top priority.”   ####  Katja Wünschel, COO Wind Onshore & Solar PV Europe & APAC RWE Renewables   World premiere in Eemshaven: RWE builds the first wind turbines on a sea dike dam.    The Oostpolderdijk Wind Farm in the Dutch province of Groningen will consist of three turbines. This is the first time that such a project has been undertaken. Due to limited space at the site of the dike a climbing crane is being used to install the top turbine components. So far, the foundations and the lowest turbine components of the wind turbines have already been built. One wind turbine has been fully completed, and the climbing crane has begun the further construction of the second wind turbine.  In recent years, RWE and Water Board Noorderzijlvest (the owner of the sea dike dam) have conducted meticulous research into the construction process and dike safety, as well as the impact of the project on the local environment. This has resulted in a highly specialized technical design which is now being implemented. The most important aspect of the design has been to guarantee the safety of the dike and its dam function. Wind Farm Oostpolderdijk, with a total installed capacity of 7.5 MW, is expected to be operational by the end of 2021.  In February, RWE concluded a power purchase agreement (PPA) with ASML, the world’s largest supplier of lithography systems for the semi-conductor industry, for the purchase of green power generated by Oostpolderdijk Wind Farm and other projects.   Sustainable production portfolio in the Netherlands   RWE is a globally leading player in the energy transition sector. The Netherlands is one of the strategic markets where the company wants to further expand its sustainable energy portfolio. RWE is currently operating seven onshore wind farms with a capacity of 268 MW (pro rata view) and two solar parks, in addition to its other business activities (gas, hard coal\/biomass). Including Oostpolderdijk Wind Farm RWE is now constructing four new onshore wind farms in the Netherlands with a total capacity of 116 MW. Furthermore, RWE will add the first floating solar project to its sustainable portfolio, as well as a ground-mounted solar project. Both projects are part of Solar park Amer. In addition to this RWE is also working on the expansion of CO2-free flexible production capacity, as well as on the development of hydrogen projects, such as NortH2, FUREC and Eemshydrogen, to help to green the industry.   ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"World’s first: RWE builds wind turbines on  a sea dike dam in the Netherlands ","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2021-10-20-rwe-builds-windturbines-on-sea-dike-dam-in-netherlands","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-renewables\/2021\/2021-10-20-worlds-first-rwe-builds-windturbines-on-sea-dike-dam-in-netherlands.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

Furthermore, a second-party opinion has been issued from the internationally renowned sustainability agency Sustainalytics.  Greener, bigger, more valuable – that is RWE in 2030. With its new strategy ‘Growing Green’, RWE is massively stepping up the pace and is investing €50 billion gross in its core business. That means an average of €5 billion gross each year for offshore and onshore wind, solar, batteries, flexible generation and hydrogen. The company is thus expanding its portfolio by 25 gigawatts net to 50 gigawatts (GW) in the attractive markets of Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific Region.

{"id":8792,"text":"Green steel: Partners to build pioneering direct reduction test plant with hydrogen in Lingen    * Government of Lower Saxony confirms funding for research project    * RWE, CO2GRAB, LSF and BENTELER Steel\/Tube to test technologies for CO2-free steel production   * Direct reduction test plant to be commissioned in 2022    ### Lingen\/Essen, 18 November 2021  Hydrogen will play a key role on the path towards decarbonising the steel industry. But how can the energy source of the future be used to produce climate-neutral steel in a cost-effective manner? Over the next three years the companies RWE, CO2GRAB, LSF and BENTELER Steel\/Tube will conduct research in this area. Today, Olaf Lies, Minister for Environment, Energy, Building and Climate Protection in Lower Saxony announced the state’s commitment to providing €3 million of funding to the CO2GRAB start-up. In 2022, the pioneering demonstration project for a green hydrogen direct reduction plant is to be built on RWE’s Lingen power plant site.  Olaf Lies: “Only a few years ago, a lot of people would not have taken it seriously at all, but now it is becoming a reality: the defossilisation of Germany’s steel industry. This is an essential component for the energy transition to succeed. And it sends another message to the world, that with expertise, determination and conviction we are bringing together objectives that would have been considered incompatible not too long ago. It is of vital importance to support: climate protection and energy transition whilst future-proofing Germany as a home for industry. I am therefore delighted to support this project in contributing towards solving this mammoth task.”  Lingen’s Lord Mayor Dieter Krone points out: “This collaboration shows the clear commitment of everyone involved in the project to innovation and climate protection. Once again Lingen will become a centre for research and development and one of Germany’s most important hydrogen locations.  In green direct reduction, iron ore is reduced using hydrogen. The hydrogen reacts with the oxygen in the iron ore (iron oxide) and transforms it into sponge iron, also known as “direct reduced iron” (DRI). Unlike in traditional furnaces, steam rather than carbon dioxide is produced using this technology. The sponge iron is then melted down with steel scrap and further processed to make steel. BENTELER Steel\/Tube will in future use this type of steel to produce low-carbon seamless and welded tube solutions. During the first stage of the research project, over 1 ton\/hour of green iron (sponge iron) will be produced using green hydrogen. Green hydrogen is to be produced in electrolysers on the power plant site and fed into the DRI plant.   “This DRI technology has enormous potential in terms of decarbonising the steel industry. The technical expertise of the CO2GRAB start-up, which will build and operate the plant, ideally complements RWE’s knowledge along the entire green hydrogen value chain. LSF will optimise electrolyser operation for fluctuating wind and solar power generation. BENTELER Steel\/Tube will then process the reduced sponge iron further to green steel and climate-neutral quality tubes. With this project we can thus make a significant contribution towards becoming climate-neutral,” the partners said in a joint statement. Commissioning of the demonstration plant is planned for the middle of 2022.   Images for media use are available from the RWE media library.

{"id":8820,"text":"Decommissioning activities at year-end: RWE implements legally mandated exit from coal and nuclear power    * Unit C at Gundremmingen nuclear power plant and three lignite units to close      * Total capacity of affected power stations 2,200 megawatts    ### Essen\/Cologne, 30 December 2021  On New Year’s Eve, as planned, RWE will take a total of 2,200 megawatts (MW) of power station capacity off the grid. One of the facilities to close is Unit C, a boiling water reactor accounting for about 1,300 MW and the last component remaining at Gundremmingen. In the Rhenish lignite mining region, the company is switching off its 300 MW units Neurath B, Niederaussem C und Weisweiler E. “This represents a further step in our rigorous efforts to implement the legally mandated phase-out of nuclear power and coal,” explains RWE Power CEO Dr Frank Weigand. The four power station units earmarked for closure have generated more than 400 billion kilowatt hours of electricity since they were commissioned. That is roughly equivalent to the electricity needs of Berlin, including all businesses and residential households, for a period of 90 years. This process is part of the legally mandated decommissioning roadmap, and the German Federal Network Agency has been notified accordingly.  “The fact these power station units have operated so reliably and safely and have made an important contribution to security of supply is down to the efforts of our skilled, experienced and motivated employees who have worked there over the years,” says Weigand, praising the power station teams. “They deserve our special respect and recognition.”  The next round of decommissioning activities will follow in 2022, beginning on 1 April when a further 300 MW unit at Neurath will be taken off the grid. At the end of that year, RWE Power will shut down the two 600 MW units at the same location, and end briquette production at its factory in Frechen. All in all, a further 1,620 MW in the lignite area will be decommissioned next year. The company will also shut down its Emsland nuclear power plant in Lingen (1,400 MW).  In December 2020, RWE already decommissioned Unit E at its Westfalen Power Station, representing 800 megawatts, and Ibbenbüren Power Station, also accounting for 800 MW. RWE thus no longer operates hard-coal power stations in the United Kingdom and Germany, while in the Netherlands, the coal-fired power stations operated by RWE are being converted to biomass. As set down in Germany’s Coal Phase-Out Act, RWE also shut down the first of its units in the Rhenish lignite mining region, with a generation capacity of 300 MW, at the end of 2020.  Between 2020 and 2022, RWE will thus decommission power stations with a combined capacity of more than 7,000 megawatts.  These shutdowns have huge repercussions for RWE’s employees: By the end of 2023, RWE Power will have cut job numbers in the Rhineland, covering the entire process chain from open-cast mining to maintenance, administration and power generation, by about 3,000. Employee numbers at the Gundremmingen nuclear power station will drop from about 600 at the start of 2017 to about 440 at the end of 2022; the remaining employees will continue working through to the 2030s on post-shutdown operations and deconstruction work at the location. The first step will be to remove the nuclear fuel rods from the reactor and transfer them to the holding basin. The employee cutbacks are being performed in line with principles of social responsibility, including payment of “adaptation allowances” in the lignite area.  Tomorrow’s lignite closures represent a further step in RWE’s carbon reduction strategy, which will enable it to save a further 7 million tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub> per year. At the same time, RWE is rigorously forging ahead with the expansion of renewables. By 2030, the company will have invested €50 billion gross in the expansion of renewables, batteries, storage systems, hydrogen and flexible back-up capacity.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Decommissioning activities at year-end: RWE implements legally mandated exit from coal and nuclear power","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Power AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-power\/2021-12-30-rwe-implements-legally-mandated-exit-from-coal-and-nuclear-power","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-power-ag\/2021\/2021-12-30-rwe-implements-legally-mandated-exit-from-coal-and-nuclear-power.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The company is erecting three Nordex turbines with a total installed capacity of 11.7 megawatts (MW) and a hub height of 134 metres in Lower Saxony’s Harburg district, around 50 kilometres south of Hamburg. Once they become fully operational in late summer, the turbines will produce enough green electricity to supply 7,500 homes. RWE is making good progress with expanding its wind farm portfolio in Germany. Most recently, the company was granted approval for two onshore wind projects in Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. In its home market of Germany, RWE, with its long-standing wind power experience, operates an onshore business with over 580 MW capacity (pro rata).  “Evendorf is a positive example of how the pace of building additional renewables capacities can be stepped up due to good collaboration with state and local authorities. I want to thank the local stakeholders and the local authority for their great support with this project,” said Jens Edler-Krupp, who is responsible for developing RWE’s German onshore wind farms. Christian Sauer, Lord Mayor of the Egestorf municipality to which Evendorf belongs, points out: “To achieve the ambitious targets of the energy transition, we need onshore wind power. Each wind turbine saves large volumes of climate-damaging CO2. You'd hardly think that three new wind turbines will soon be up and running here. But from late-summer they will be generating large amounts of climate-friendly energy.”  RWE’s ambitions for growth in Germany  RWE will expand its team to develop the regional onshore wind and solar business in Germany and will open seven new offices soon. About 200 new colleagues are to be hired to rigorously drive project development. RWE wants to invest up to €15 billion in the expansion of offshore and onshore wind, solar, storage, flexible back-up capacities and hydrogen in its home market by 2030.

It is set to begin operations by the end of this year, following which it will then be able to supply the equivalent of 30,000 homes with green electricity. Rea Unificado is the latest building block in our ambitious investment and growth programme ‘Growing Green’. Through this, we are also supporting Spain on its path towards the energy transition and are contributing towards strengthening the Spanish economy.”   ####  Katja Wünschel, designated CEO Wind Onshore and PV Europe & Australia, RWE Renewables   RWE is investing more than 40 million euros in its new Rea Unificado wind farm in north-eastern Spain. The 43-megawatt (MW) wind farm is to be built in Soria, approximately 160 kilometres east of Saragossa. The nine Nordex wind turbines will be erected from Spring 2022, with the wind farm due to have commenced operation by the end of this same year.  The company is building nine turbines with a nominal capacity of 4.8 megawatts (MW) each – by far the largest in size and capacity within its Spanish fleet. Once it is fully operational, Rea Unificado will be able to supply 30,000 homes with carbon-neutral electricity. In addition, existing infrastructure will be utilised optimally by connecting the wind farm to an existing substation nearby.  RWE as the engine powering Spain’s drive towards climate neutrality  Due to its geographic situation, attractive external conditions and ambitious climate targets, Spain is ideally positioned to expand wind and solar power facilities. According to the national energy and climate plan, a total of 157 gigawatts (GW) of generation capacity are to be installed in the country by 2030, with 50 GW from wind power alone. As one of the global leaders in the renewables sector, RWE already operates onshore wind farms with a total capacity of 440 megawatts in Spain, as well as some smaller hydroelectric power stations. In addition, the company is currently working on two new solar farms with a capacity of 88 MW. Last year, RWE commissioned the Alarcos ground-mounted solar power station with a capacity of 45 MW. Furthermore, the company is involved in a photovoltaic plant in the province of Toledo and the Andasol 3 solar-thermal power plant.  The energy group is currently constructing onshore wind farms in the US, the UK, France, Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany. By 2030, RWE will expand its installed onshore wind and solar capacity from seven to 20 gigawatts.

The country is seeing continued expansion of renewables and we are determined to contribute to Poland’s energy transition. With these recent tender successes we take another important step towards developing a sizable solar business in the country.”   ####  Katja Wünschel, designated CEO Wind Onshore and PV Europe & Australia, RWE Renewables   RWE is growing its renewables portfolio in Poland: at the end of December the company received Contract for Difference (CfD) awards from the Polish Energy Regulatory Office for solar projects with a total capacity of more than 20 megawatts (MWac).  “These projects strengthen our position as a leading producer of green electricity in Poland,” explains Agnieszka Wojnarowska, Head of Onshore Development Europe, Scandinavia and Baltics at RWE Renewables. “We will benefit from the expertise of our well-established wind business in the realisation of the awarded photovoltaic projects. Our new solar projects are small to medium in size, but we have grouped them into clusters in order to optimise construction and operations.”  Nine of the photovoltaic (PV) plants with a total capacity of around 7 MWac are located in West Pomerania and Greater Poland. Two further mid-size solar projects with a total capacity of 14 MWac will be installed in Lower Silesia. Subject to the final investment decision, commissioning is expected in late 2023.  Recently, RWE has signed the Polish PV Sector Deal, a joint agreement between the Polish government, developers, associations and industry players from across the entire solar supply chain. With this agreement all parties commit to supporting the development, construction and operation of PV projects in Poland. That underpins RWE’s ambition to rigorously drive the expansion of its Polish solar business along with its strong footprint in wind.  In Poland, RWE is currently realising 42 ground-mounted PV plants with a total capacity of 32 MWac. This year a further 29 MWac will be added to the construction pipeline. To continuously enhance its Polish solar business the company is looking for appropriate locations throughout the country.  As one of the world's leading renewable energy companies RWE has a well-stocked development pipeline of 10 GW of solar projects globally.

A total of four Nordex wind turbines are being erected in the Rotenburg (Wümme) district, at the south-western edge of the Hamburg metropolitan area. What is special about this project is that three turbines with a total installed capacity of 17.1 megawatts (MW) are owned by RWE, while a further, identical turbine with a nominal capacity of 5.7 MW is erected by RWE on behalf of the local citizens’ cooperative OsteWind GmbH & Co. KG. The cooperative will operate this turbine themselves. “Following completion of the work, currently planned for the end of this year, the four wind turbines will produce enough green electricity to supply over 13,000 households with climate-friendly energy,” says said Jens Edler-Krupp, who is responsible for developing RWE’s German onshore wind farms.  The new wind farm in northern Lower Saxony is not just more proof of RWE's ambition to implement every feasible renewables project in Germany, it also shows that collaboration with local partners is an excellent way to drive the energy transition forward. RWE already operates onshore wind farms with an installed capacity of more than 580 MW in the country.

This shows how important it is to accelerate the expansion of renewable energy. RWE wants to contribute to this, especially in its home market of Germany, and implement every project that is possible. The wind farms in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony are good examples of this. By the end of the decade, we plan to invest up to 15 :billion euros gross in our green core business here in Germany.”   ####  Katja Wünschel, CEO Wind Onshore and Solar Europe & Australia, RWE Renewables   Double success for RWE in onshore wind power infrastructure auction: The German Federal Network Agency has awarded it the Grevenbroich wind farm in North Rhine-Westphalia and the Bartelsdorf 2 project in Lower Saxony. These positive decisions will help RWE to accelerate its expansion of renewables in Germany. This year alone, the company is investing about €60 million into three new onshore construction projects, including Sandbostel-Bevern in addition to Grevenbroich and Bartelsdorf 2.  In specific terms, three Nordex units are being constructed at the location in the Rhenish mining region, accounting for 5.7 megawatts (MW) each. The scheduled start date for the Grevenbroich wind farm, with a total installed capacity of 17.1 MW, is as early as the second quarter of 2022, and it is expected to go into operation at the end of this year.   In the rural district of Rotenburg (Wümme) between Hamburg and Bremen, RWE will add five Nordex turbines to its existing wind farm Bartelsdorf, taking the total to 21. This will give the wind farm an additional 28.5 MW of capacity. The start of construction in this case is planned for the summer of 2022, with commissioning in 2023. A special aspect in this case is that two of the newly constructed units will pass to Bürgergesellschaft Heidland Wind GmbH & Co. KG, a local citizens’ cooperative, while the others will be operated by RWE. This is one way in which RWE is continuing its successful collaboration with local partners.  Sustainable growth to 2030  Both onshore projects are part of RWE’s “Growing Green” strategy. By the end of the decade, the company will have invested €50 billion gross in its core business, expanding its green generation capacity to 50 gigawatts. In Germany alone, it aims to invest up to €15 billion gross in offshore and onshore wind, solar, batteries, flexible generation and hydrogen. To further maintain the pace of expansion, RWE has advertised 200 new positions for the development of onshore wind and utility-scale photovoltaic plants in Germany.

{"id":8864,"text":"Repowering project completed: RWE puts Krusemark-Ellingen wind farm into operation    * Total generating capacity up by a quarter, from 15.7 to 19.8 MW   * Innovative recycling concept for old turbines, towers and foundations    ### Essen, 21 April 2022  “Replacing older wind turbines with new, much more efficient ones is part of our growth offensive for renewable energy. If the energy transition is to be accelerated and Germany is to be almost completely supplied with green electricity exclusively as early as 2035, we all have to play our part. RWE intends to invest up to 15 billion euros gross in its green core business by 2030 for climate protection and security of supply.”   ####  Katja Wünschel, CEO Wind Onshore and Solar Europe & Australia, RWE Renewables   More power for the Krusemark-Ellingen wind farm in Saxony-Anhalt: The decision has recently been taken to “repower” this project, which was initially constructed between 1998 and 2004, and the sixth and last new wind turbine has been put in place. The state-of-the-art Nordex turbines, each with a generation capacity of 3.3 megawatts (MW), replace the 15 existing Enercon systems, resulting in a substantial increase in the wind farm’s generation capacity overall, despite the lower number of rotors. The location now has a total installed capacity of 19.8 MW, compared to “only” 15.7 MW previously. That represents an increase of about a quarter. The new systems can provide a climate-neutral supply of electricity to more than 13,000 households.   Krusemark-Ellingen is RWE’s third repowering project in Germany. Replacing older systems with a smaller number of much more powerful turbines makes it possible to extend the life cycle of many locations. Studies confirm that simply installing state-of-the-art systems at established sites in Germany has the potential to boost wind power generation to more than 210 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2030 (2020: 132 TWh). To put this in context, 210 TWh represents approximately 37 percent of Germany’s gross electricity consumption in 2020. Repowering can therefore be an important tool in achieving the German government’s greatly increased expansion targets for renewables. These are ambitious goals, and RWE wishes to make a significant contribution: It is bolstering its team accordingly, with 200 new employees to be appointed in the short term to forge ahead with project development in Germany.   Krusemark-Ellingen is a showcase project for RWE in many regards: “For the first time we are dismantling existing turbines and simultaneously installing new systems,” says Jens Edler-Krupp, who is responsible for developing RWE’s German onshore wind farms. “As a result, it’s possible to keep the old systems running and generating electricity for as long as possible. In addition, the wind farm now consists of just six matching turbines instead of the original 15, which were not completely uniform.” This project, in the rural district of Stendal, also breaks new ground in the important area of recycling. Most of the decommissioned Enercon turbines are being sold as complete sets, including the steel towers, to be re-used on other wind farms. “And part of the material from the old foundations is being put to use at the same location as a base course for the new access roads,” Edler-Krupp adds.

{"id":8865,"text":"RWE to deliver solar power produced at Inden opencast mine from summer    * Start of construction for innovative combination of 26,500 modules and battery storage   * Photovoltaic plant to run from 2022 until completion of Lake Inde       ### Cologne\/Essen, 26 April 2022  In only a few weeks’ time, RWE’s Inden Opencast Mine will no longer produce just lignite, but also solar power. After officially breaking ground, building work has commenced for a utility-scale photovoltaics system with integrated battery storage. The solar modules will produce a peak electric output of 14.4 megawatts (MW). The “RWE indeland Solarpark” is the first of its kind in Europe and combines around 26,500 solar modules and a battery storage system. The plant is expected to be commissioned by late summer this year.  The plant is named after the Inden opencast mining region where it is located, in the district of Düren, North Rhine-Westphalia. Lignite mining will end in seven years and leave an extensive lake – the centre of a dramatically changing landscape. District Administrator Wolfgang Spelthahn, Mayor Stefan Pfennings and indeland Managing Director Jens Bröker all work closely with RWE on shaping the future of this area. Together with RWE Renewables CEO Onshore Wind and Solar Katja Wünschel and RWE Power CTO Dr Lars Kulik, they officially launched the construction work for the plant.  The solar modules will be installed in two 1.4-kilometre-long and 100-metre-wide rows on a gravelled surface at the western edge of the opencast mine. After the end of mining operations in 2029, the area will be at the edge of the lake. However, it will take two decades before water reaches this area – paving the way for the delivery of this innovative large scale solar farm with battery storage. That is exactly what RWE proposed to the German Federal Network Agency as part of a tender for innovation initiatives – and which it won last year.  The battery storage system is designed for a two-hour charging and supply cycle of 9.6 megawatt hours, functioning as a buffer between generation and grid. In this way, feed-in can be even better tailored to meet demand.   Katja Wünschel, CEO Onshore Wind and Solar Europe & Australia at RWE Renewables: “We are investing 11 million euros in our new project at the Inden opencast mine. This makes RWE indeland solar farm the next building block of a climate-friendly and more import-independent electricity production.” RWE is planning to build at least 500 megawatts of generation capacity from renewable sources in the Rhenish lignite mining district alone. Katja Wünschel: “We are making North Rhine-Westphalia one of the centres in our innovation and growth strategy. Here, we want to implement every wind and solar project possible and thus help to shape the enormous transformation, especially in the Rhenish mining district.”  Dr Lars Kulik, CTO Lignite at RWE Power: “Energy transition and structural change in the Rhenish mining district are progressing well with projects like the RWE indeland solar farm. There is plenty of space for renewables facilities on the areas previously used for opencast mining – the mining district will thus remain an energy location in the future.”   Next to the new solar generation and storage project, RWE operates the indeland wind farms Eschweiler and Fronhoven A; they are also joint projects with regional partners, as are the Königshovener Höhe and Bedburg A 44n wind farms near the Garzweiler opencast mine. RWE already operates or is currently building wind parks with a total installed capacity of around 200 MW in the Rhenish mining district. Further wind farm and PV projects are in planning, for example in the Garzweiler opencast mine and its immediate neighbourhood.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE to deliver solar power produced at Inden opencast mine from summer","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2022-04-26-rwe-to-deliver-solar-power-produced-at-inden-opencast-mine-from-summer","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-renewables\/2022\/2022-04-26-rwe-to-deliver-solar-power-produced-at-inden-opencast-mine-from-summer.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":8876,"text":"New Delegated Act puts brakes on green hydrogen    * REPowerEU initiative’s ambitious targets counteracted by detailed rules    ### Essen, 23 May 2022  “The European Commission’s REPowerEU package was conceived as a watershed for security of supply and climate protection. The increased targets for the expansion of renewables and the ramp-up of hydrogen are a step in the right direction. But the detailed rules around hydrogen criteria that have now been proposed will put the brakes on needed investment in the coming years. The transformation of industry will be unnecessarily delayed because the green hydrogen that is urgently needed will not be available quickly enough in the volumes required. The current detailed rules proposal will put the brakes on a good plan. Europe needs green gases as soon as possible to achieve our climate targets and for more independence from Russia.”  ####  Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE AG   With the REPowerEU initiative, the EU Commission aims to decisively drive forward its goals for security of supply, independence from Russian fuel supplies and its ambitious climate targets. The key components of the initiative are to increase the expansion of renewables and to accelerate the ramp-up of the hydrogen market.  However, at the same time, the delegated act now proposed, which specifies the future game rules for European hydrogen production, massively counteracts these ambitious goals. Instead of accelerating the ramp-up of the hydrogen economy, the regulation puts unnecessary shackles on it.  The delegated act specifies that, following a short transitional period, by 2026 it will be permissible to use only electricity from newly constructed, unsubsidised wind and solar plants to generate green hydrogen. Even if planning and approval processes for new wind and solar power plants are to be accelerated in future, this would mean that it would not be possible to produce green hydrogen in large volumes before 2030.  The proposal that electrolysers may only produce hydrogen when electricity is almost simultaneously being produced by these new wind and solar farms is also problematic. This temporal correlation means that electrolysers would have to sit idle during any extended calm period. The result would be an unnecessary increase in the price of hydrogen due to more complex operations, and would make it almost impossible to ensure a continuous supply to industry.  What is intended as acceleration will in fact amount to slamming on the brakes. In other areas, such as electric mobility, there is no direct coupling of generation from directly allocated renewables plants either. What is more, from an energy industry perspective this kind of approach is entirely unnecessary, since emissions trading regulates CO2 reductions and ensures that emissions of CO2 are limited to the available number of allowances.  RWE and many other companies are prepared to invest billions of euros in making the switch to green hydrogen a reality. Many industrial companies want to convert their production processes. But to do so, they need the certainty that green hydrogen will be available as quickly as possible, in sufficient volumes, and at a reasonable cost. In recent months, industry has therefore drawn up many constructive proposals around how to leverage headroom when it comes to the green hydrogen requirements. RWE will actively work towards this in the upcoming consultation and hopes that political decision-makers rethink the current criteria proposals.  If Europe wants to achieve its ambitious climate targets, it also needs a brand new approach going forward: There should be no limiting criteria for the producers and purchasers of green hydrogen around the use of electricity. Instead, the member states should take the additional electricity required to ramp up electrolyser capacity into account in their national build-out targets for renewables. Separate proof by the green electricity community would then no longer be necessary. The current revision of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) offers the opportunity to do this and, if implemented, this will make it possible to further unleash hydrogen’s potential.   ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","title":"New Delegated Act puts brakes on green hydrogen","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2022-05-23-new-delegated-act-puts-brakes-on-green-hydrogen","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-ag\/2022\/2022-05-23-new-delegated-act-puts-brakes-on-green-hydrogen.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

Its use in combination with our existing power plant in Eemshaven, enables RWE to develop Eemshaven into one of the leading energy and hydrogen hubs in Northwest Europe. Supplemented by an offshore wind farm Hollandse Kust West, which also provides for 600 megawatts of electrolyser capacity and for which RWE has submitted a bid, we want to actively support the decarbonisation of industry in the Netherlands and thus contribute to achieving the Dutch climate targets.”   ####  Roger Miesen, CEO of RWE Generation SE   RWE will acquire the gas-fired power plant ‘Magnum’ at Eemshaven, the Netherlands, in the province of Groningen from Vattenfall. The two companies have signed an agreement to this effect. The plant, which has been in operation since 2013, is one of the most modern power plants of its kind and has an installed capacity of 1.4 gigawatts.  Magnum is located in the immediate vicinity of RWE’s existing power plant in Eemshaven, a hard coal-and biomass-fired power plant of 1,560 megawatts capacity. Thereby RWE expects comprehensive benefits from sharing local infrastructure.  Already hydrogen-ready gas-fired power station  Thanks to its construction design, Magnum is already ‘hydrogen-ready’ today: the plant can be made technically suitable to co-fire hydrogen by up to 30 per cent. Moreover, there may also be the possibility of converting Magnum to rely on hydrogen as its sole fuel by the end of the decade. Magnum not only supports the decarbonisation of the Dutch energy sector, but also the local expansion of the hydrogen infrastructure in the province of Groningen, in which RWE is already actively involved through the ‘Eemshydrogen’ project cluster.  Sopna Sury, COO Hydrogen of RWE Generation SE: “With the acquisition of the power plant in Eemshaven, we are strengthening our Eemshydrogen project cluster. At this site, we want to drive forward the production of low-cost hydrogen at large scale. Green hydrogen is the key element for decarbonising the industry and thus an important pillar for the success of the energy transition.”  Since 2020, RWE has been developing Eemshydrogen, an innovative project for the environmentally friendly production of hydrogen in Eemshaven. As part of the tender for the Hollandse Kust West VII offshore wind farm, RWE also plans to build electrolysers with a total capacity of 600 megawatts. This would sustainably develop the province of Groningen into one of the focal points of the Dutch hydrogen economy.  Eemshaven site could be CO2 negative  The close vicinity to the Dutch North Sea and the surrounding former natural gas fields also make it possible for Magnum and RWE’s Eemshaven power plant to use carbon capture storage (CCS) technologies in the future. This would allow the Eemshaven site to be operated as not just CO2 neutral, but with a negative CO2 output. RWE hopes to get the required government support to make this technically, politically and economically feasible.  At Groningen province’s Eemshaven port, in the immediate vicinity of Magnum, Gasunie is developing LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminals, which can be additionally supported, for example, by heat supplied from RWE power plants.  A holistic use of the Eemshaven site thus enables RWE to create one of the leading energy and hydrogen hubs in Northwest Europe.  Closing of the transaction by the end of September 2022  Closing of the transaction is expected by the end of September 2022. The agreed purchase price corresponds to an enterprise value of EUR 500 million. Another component of the transaction is a solar plant with a capacity of 5.6 megawatts located on the site. RWE will take over Magnum’s entire workforce from Vattenfall. The transaction is amongst others subject to the advice of Vattenfall’s works council.  For many years, RWE has been supporting the Dutch government in driving forward the energy transition. The Netherlands is one of the key markets where RWE wants to further expand its renewable energy portfolio. Here, RWE currently operates seven onshore wind farms with a total installed capacity of more than 330 MW (RWE’s pro-rata share) with further projects under development and construction. Furthermore, RWE operates and develops solar farms including the floating solar project at Amer. In addition to Eemshydrogen, RWE is also working on the development of onshore and offshore hydrogen projects, such as H2opZee, NortH2 and FUREC, which all contribute to decarbonising the industry.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE acquires 1.4-gigawatt power plant from Vattenfall and develops Eemshaven site into a leading energy and hydrogen hub in Northwest Europe ","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2022-06-02-rwe-acquires-1-4-gigawatt-power-plant-from-vattenfall","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-ag\/2022\/2022-06-02-rwe-aquires-1-4-gigawatt-power-plant-from-vattenfall.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["unsure"]}

The partnership centres on driving forward the production of carbon-neutral steel, with a plan to replace coal with wind power and green hydrogen as the main source of energy in steel production at ArcelorMittal’s steelmaking sites in Germany.  To decarbonise its production sites in Bremen, Hamburg, Eisenhüttenstadt and Duisburg as planned, ArcelorMittal Germany needs renewable energy on a large scale.  RWE and ArcelorMittal are assessing options for joint participation in tenders for offshore wind farm sites in the North Sea. The amendment of the \"Wind Energy at Sea Act\" (WindSeeG) currently under way is crucial for success, as it will permanently shape the cost structure in the German offshore wind sector. If the law were to establish \"negative bids\" in offshore wind tenders, financing wind farms would be more challenging and send the wrong pricing signals to the market by making wind power unnecessarily expensive. Competitive electricity prices are absolutely necessary, if energy-intensive industries such as the steel industry, which operates in a competitive global environment, are to have a future in Germany. RWE and ArcelorMittal strongly believe that with the right steer, green steel from Germany can become a benchmark worldwide for low-carbon emissions steel production.  RWE and ArcelorMittal also want to work together on the development of green hydrogen, by jointly looking for areas where electrolysis plants can be built to supply the steel production sites in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, starting with a 70 MW pilot plant by 2026 with the clear intention to increase to Gigawatt-scale projects in the long term - subject to approval of public funding.  With the combination of RWE’s expertise in offshore wind farms and electrolysers, and ArcelorMittal as a guaranteed buyer of the green electricity and hydrogen, the two companies believe they have excellent opportunities for a viable partnership arrangement. RWE and ArcelorMittal intend to conclude long-term purchase agreements for both wind power and green hydrogen.  Sven Utermöhlen, CEO Offshore Wind, RWE Renewables: “Electricity from renewable energies and green hydrogen must become the hallmark of industrial production in Germany. Industry needs both in large quantities as soon as possible in order to achieve its climate targets. That is why we are planning one of the most ambitious expansion projects for offshore wind farms and electrolysers in Germany, together with ArcelorMittal. If the regulatory framework is right, we want to be successful together in the bidding for offshore areas. ArcelorMittal is an excellent partner to expand our industry cooperation and thus give real impetus to decarbonisation projects in Germany.”  Reiner Blaschek, CEO ArcelorMittal Germany, comments: “ArcelorMittal Germany is embarking on a radical transition to ensure we reach our CO2 emissions reduction targets, meaning that the energy used to make steel will need to be clean energy. The partnership we have announced with RWE today is significant for a number of reasons: it will provide us with the renewable, affordable electricity and green hydrogen that we need to produce low-emissions steel while remaining competitive in a global market. It also offers vital security in the supply chain, by integrating the supply of energy and hydrogen into our business. We are looking forward to working with RWE on this highly important project and benefiting from their experience and know-how, as we continue to lead the industry in the decarbonisation of steelmaking in Germany and beyond.”  As the world’s leading steel producer, ArcelorMittal has ambitious climate action goals, including a target to reduce CO2 emissions by 35% by 2030 in Europe, and a group-wide target to be carbon neutral by 2050. By 2030, ArcelorMittal is aiming to exceed this target in Germany, by moving away from coal-intensive blast furnace technology to electric arc furnaces (EAFs) and direct reduction (DRI) plants. They also plan to gradually replace natural gas with green hydrogen as the fuel for these facilities, once it is cost-competitive at scale.  In addition to the partnership on renewable electricity and green hydrogen, the companies want to investigate possible uses for ArcelorMittal’s low-emissions steel in components for RWE's renewable electricity plants. RWE wants to be climate-neutral by 2040. To achieve this goal, the energy company needs to decarbonise its supply chain, and the use of low-emissions steel will make an important contribution to this.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE and ArcelorMittal intend to jointly build and operate offshore wind farms and hydrogen facilities, for low-emissions steelmaking","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2022-06-22-rwe-and-arcelormittal-mou-to-build-and-operate-offshore-wind-farms-and-hydrogen-facilities","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-ag\/2022\/2022-06-22-rwe-and-arcelormittal-to-build-and-operate-offshore-wind-farms-and-hydrogen-facilities.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":8893,"text":"RWE starts construction of a ground-mounted solar farm in Portugal    * Construction works underway; full commissioning expected in 2023   * Bifacial module technology increases production   * Green electricity to supply the equivalent of 42,000 Portuguese homes    ### Essen, 23 June 2022  “We are happy to contribute to the energy transition in Portugal with our new ground-mounted solar farm. In one of the sunniest regions of the country we will install more than 91,000 bifacial modules, which will help to increase the production of the whole plant. Once completed in 2023, this project will further strengthen our already strong renewables footprint on the Iberian Peninsula as well as our global solar portfolio.”  ####  Katja Wünschel, CEO Onshore Wind and PV Europe & Australia, RWE Renewables:   RWE is making good progress in expanding its solar business in Europe: having last year kicked-off the construction for two ground-mounted solar farms, and plans to start construction of another one in Spain this summer, the company is now realising a new photovoltaic (PV) project in Portugal. The solar farm with a planned capacity of 44 megawatts (MWac) is located south of Lisbon in Morgavel, Sines. With around 3,000 hours of sun per year, this is one of the sunniest regions of the country.     For this solar project, RWE will use bifacial high-performance modules. The advantage: the bifacial cells are embedded in a double-sided glass-module by which the solar radiation can be absorbed from both sides - the front and the back of the module.     Early construction works have already kicked-off. The installation of more than 91,000 solar panels is expected to start in late summer on an area of about 100 hectares. The construction works for the PV plant will be carried out by Omexom Portugal. Construção e Manutenção Eletromecânica (CME) is the contractor for the substation and grid connection works.     After full commissioning in 2023, RWE’s Morgavel photovoltaic plant will be able to supply the equivalent of approximately 42,000 Portuguese homes with green electricity and will make a substantial contribution to reach the local climate targets.     As one of the leading renewable energy companies, RWE is operating photovoltaic plants worldwide – including Limondale, which is with a capacity of 249 MWac one of the largest solar farms in Australia. Further solar projects are in development or already under construction with a strong focus on implementing innovative solutions. This year the company has completed its first floating photovoltaic project on a lake in the Netherlands. In addition, RWE is currently constructing solar plants with integrated battery storage systems and is looking into the development of agricultural photovoltaic plants.     As part of its ambitious “Growing Green” growth strategy RWE is massively stepping up the pace and is investing €50 billion gross in its core business in this decade. That means an average of €5 billion gross each year for offshore and onshore wind, solar, batteries, flexible generation and hydrogen. In onshore wind and solar, RWE is expanding its installed capacity from 7 gigawatts to 20 gigawatts by 2030.

This is particularly evident in Lower Saxony, where we already operate 31 wind farms and are now building another, Bartelsdorf 2 – again together with local partners. We want to implement every renewable project that is possible. In addition to wind farms at sea and on land, this also includes large photovoltaic plants.”  ####  Katja Wünschel, CEO Onshore Wind and Solar Europe & Australia, RWE Renewables   RWE continues to drive forward the expansion of renewable energies in Germany. Today marks the start of construction for the new Bartelsdorf 2 wind farm in the district of Rotenburg (Wümme), Lower Saxony. This will add five Nordex turbines to the existing Bartelsdorf wind farm, which is located between Hamburg and Bremen, bringing the total number of turbines to 21. The total capacity will increase by 28.5 megawatts (MW) to a total of 60.5 MW, which means that the entire wind farm will be able to generate enough green electricity to meet the needs of over 38,000 households.  As at other locations, RWE is relying on successful cooperation with local partners for the expansion of the Bartelsdorf wind farm. Two of the new turbines to be built will be operated by Bürgergesellschaft Heidland Wind GmbH & Co. KG, the other three will be operated by RWE. The new turbines, which will reach a hub height of 164 meters, are scheduled to be operational as early as next year. Only in March, the Federal Network Agency had given the project the go-ahead. At the same time, the construction of the Grevenbroich wind farm in North Rhine-Westphalia was also approved, with commissioning planned for the end of this year.  With the groundbreaking ceremony for the Bartelsdorf 2 wind farm, RWE is building its 32nd wind farm in Lower Saxony. Once commissioned, the total capacity of the company's onshore wind farms here will increase to around 300 MW.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Tailwind for Lower Saxony: RWE starts construction of Bartelsdorf 2 wind farm","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2022-06-28-rwe-starts-construction-of-bartelsdorf-2-wind-farm","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-renewables\/2022\/2022-06-28-rwe-starts-construction-of-bartelsdorf-2-wind-farm.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The new onshore wind farm will be located near the town of Żnin in Kujawsko-Pomorskie, about 260 kilometers east of Szczecin.     “The investment made by RWE is part of the direction the municipality and the entire region is taking towards green energy. We are already installing photovoltaic systems on public buildings and encouraging residents to replace their heat sources. Thanks to the investment by one of the world's leading energy companies, the grid will now be powered by green electricity in about ten months, benefiting the environment in Poland. As part of the wind farm community package significant funds will be donated to the our town thus meeting the expectations of residents who want to live in an ecological region,” says Robert Luchowski, the Mayor of Żnin.     The entire park will consist of 16 wind turbines. RWE has secured support in the auction system (CfD, Contract for Difference) for the Żnin project with a capacity of 48 megawatts (MW).     “The construction work to prepare the infrastructure, such as path work and the pouring of the foundations, will now begin. The construction of a wind farm also offers benefits to the farmers in the surrounding area: We will create new access roads and pavements. This will facilitate access to the fields and thus improve daily operations. At the beginning of 2023, the community of Żnin will be able to watch the process of installation of wind turbines,” says Wojciech Borkowski, who is responsible for project implementation at RWE Renewables Poland.     The wind farm is scheduled to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of next year.         Expansion of green energy in Poland   A few weeks ago, RWE successfully commissioned its 16th Rozdrażew wind farm with a capacity of 16.8 MW. After fourteen months of construction, the seven turbines generate enough green power to meet the needs of more than 27,000 Polish households.      In western Poland, about 100 kilometers from Szczecin, in the municipality of Mieszkowice, RWE is building another wind farm: two wind turbines will produce enough green energy to meet the annual electricity needs of another 8,800 households. The Polish government has signed a 15-year CfD with the company for the 7 MW Wierzchlas project.     In addition to the Wierzchlas wind farm, the Dolice (48 MW) and Lech Nowy Staw III (12 MW) wind farms are also awaiting permits. RWE is diversifying its Polish renewable energy portfolio by investing in photovoltaic projects. RWE is also active in the offshore sector in Poland. The company is at an advanced stage of preparation for the construction of the 350 MW F.E.W. Baltic II project and has submitted applications for new permits in the Baltic Sea.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE begins construction of Polish wind farm Żnin","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2022-06-30-start-of-construction-polish-wind-farm-znin","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/Pressarticle\/PDF\/2022\/06\/2022-06-30-start-of-construction-polish-wind-farm-znin-en-RWE.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The municipality of Thieux is the site of the six wind turbines of the Les Hauts Bouleaux wind farm with a total capacity of 18 megawatts (MW), i.e. 3 MW per turbine. The park is able to supply more than 9,000 households with green electricity.   Joseph Fonio, Country Chair RWE Renewables France: “Les Hauts Bouleaux is the third wind farm in our portfolio to be commissioned in France and RWE will have seven wind farms in France by the end of the year. With RWE starting operations in the French market in November 2020, less than two years ago, we are pleased to see these projects come to fruition under the RWE brand. The success of a wind power project depends on the support of the local residents and their commitment, which is why we have in-house consultation experts who have a special relationship with the residents, and this is what makes us different. What is even more remarkable in the case of Hauts Bouleaux is the solidarity of the farmers during the connection phase of the park and we would like to thank them warmly.”   The site was commissioned in the spring of 2022 and was delivered on time thanks in part to the valuable help of local residents. Last autumn, torrential rains had an impact on the construction site. Local farmers helped the construction teams to dry out the land with pumps and tankers so that the six wind turbines could be connected to the electricity grid.  RWE is currently building four other onshore wind farms in France: the extension of the Epine Marie-Madeleine wind farm (22.8 MW), Moulin à Vent (6 MW), Montagne d'Huilly (15 MW) and Les Nouvions (43.6 MW), which will bring the total capacity in operation to almost 150 MW by the end of the year.  RWE is also working on the development of solar projects with five projects in advanced development in France for a total of 50 MWp, as well as 250 MWp under study.   In addition, RWE has been shortlisted for two offshore wind tenders off Normandy (AO4) and southern Brittany (AO5). For the AO6 tender in the Mediterranean with floating wind turbines, RWE has teamed up with Bourbon Subsea Services. The partners have already submitted their pre-qualification documents. RWE currently operates 18 offshore wind farms in five countries with a total capacity of around 3 GW (RWE share). The company develops and builds some of the most innovative offshore wind farms in the world, in particular with its float technology, but also by coupling it with offshore hydrogen production.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","title":"After Indre and Pas-de-Calais, RWE inaugurates its third wind farm in France","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2022-07-05-cod-les-hauts-bouleaux-frankreich","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/Pressarticle\/PDF\/2022\/07\/2022-07-05-cod-les-hauts-bouleaux-frankreich-en-RWE.pdf?sc_lang=en","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

This shows that we can make an important contribution to decarbonising the European economy with our projects. With the grants that have been envisaged, we are now developing the two selected projects at full speed in order to bring about final investment decisions quickly and to press ahead with the necessary approval procedures.”  ####  Roger Miesen, CEO of RWE Generation:   Two innovative projects with RWE involvement have been pre-selected for funding by the EU Innovation Fund - one of the world's largest programmes for demonstrating innovative low-carbon technologies.   These are RWE's FUREC project in the Netherlands and an offshore wind farm off the German coast, in whose project company Nordsee Two GmbH RWE holds a 51% stake. The two projects are among a total of 17 projects selected by the EU Innovation Fund for the preparation of grant agreements, which is now underway.     The EU Innovation Fund subsidises breakthrough technologies for renewable energy, energy-intensive industries, energy storage and carbon capture, use and storage.     The selected projects with RWE participation are:     FUREC: Under the name FUREC (Fuse Reuse Recycle), RWE wants to produce hydrogen for the chemical industry and thus contribute to making production processes more sustainable. Household waste from Limburg in the Netherlands is to replace natural gas. The FUREC project supports companies, scientific institutes and the province in their efforts to develop Limburg into a centre for the circular economy and a hydrogen hub between the Dutch seaports and the German Ruhr area. For FUREC, a plant is being built in Limburg to process residual materials into raw material pellets. These will then be converted into hydrogen in another plant in Limburg's Chemelot industrial park, which will be supplied to OCI Nitrogen's fertiliser plants. In this way, the industrial park's natural gas consumption is reduced by more than 280 million cubic metres annually. This corresponds to the annual consumption of about 200,000 households. In this way, the emission of about 500,000 tonnes of CO2 can be avoided per year. The CO2 released during hydrogen production can be captured and stored or possibly used as a raw material in the future. The hydrogen can be marketed locally in the Chemelot industrial park or transported to industrial companies in Rotterdam and the Ruhr area via a corresponding hydrogen infrastructure.      Nordsee Two: RWE (51%) is developing an offshore wind farm off the German coast together with its Canadian partner Northland Power (49%). The wind farm with a planned grid capacity of 433 megawatts (MW) is to be built north of the island of Juist and is scheduled to start commercial operation in 2026. Together, the partners are driving technological advancements in the offshore wind industry. In addition to the newest and most innovative wind turbines   (min 15 MW each), the partners aim to demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of producing hydrogen at sea. For this purpose, an electrolyser is planned to be integrated into the offshore wind farm. The green hydrogen could then be used for vessel fueling and to supply emergency power to the offshore substation or wind turbines.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Boost for RWE's hydrogen and offshore business:  Two projects selected for EU Innovation Fund grants","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2022-07-14-zwei-projekte-fuer-zuschuesse-aus-eu-innovation-fund-ausgewaehlt","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/Pressarticle\/PDF\/2022\/07\/2022-07-14-zwei-projekte-fuer-zuschuesse-aus-eu-innovation-fund-ausgewaehlt-en-RWE.pdf?sc_lang=en","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The first turbine equipped with recyclable blades is generating electricity. The expansion of renewable energies must be driven forward decisively. Faster offshore expansion is particularly important to simultaneously achieve climate targets and to create more energy sovereignty. We at RWE want to help make this happen and the commissioning of the first turbine of our Kaskasi offshore wind farm is a clear sign of this intent.”  ####  Sven Utermöhlen, CEO Wind Offshore, RWE Renewables   35 kilometres north of the island of Heligoland, the first turbine of RWE’s Kaskasi offshore wind farm was recently commissioned, and is now supplying green electricity to the grid. Nine of the in total 38 Siemens Gamesa SG 8.0-167 DD Flex offshore wind turbines are installed, each with a capacity of close to 9 megawatts (MW). Kaskasi is RWE’s sixth wind farm off the German coast. When fully operational by the end of 2022, Kaskasi will be capable of supplying the equivalent of more than 400,000 German households with green electricity every year. This is comparable to a large city like Frankfurt am Main.  World’s first recyclable wind turbine blades installed     RWE is leading the technological development in the offshore wind industry. Together with Siemens Gamesa, the Kaskasi project now features the world’s first installed recyclable wind turbine blades. The components of the 81-meter long RecyclableBlades are able to be recycled for new applications at the end of their lifecycle. RWE and Siemens Gamesa are helping to pave the way towards the full recyclability of wind turbines.     Many components of a wind turbine already have established recycling practices. Until now, the composite materials used in wind turbine blades have been more challenging to recycle. The resin system employed binds all components together. In its RecyclableBlade, Siemens Gamesa uses a resin type with a chemical structure that makes it possible to efficiently separate it from other components following decommissioning. The process protects the properties of the materials, allowing them to be reused in new casting applications, for example in the automotive industry or in consumer goods like flight cases and flatscreen casings.     Tailwind for RWE and the energy transition in Germany  RWE is one of the leading companies in the field of renewable energies and No. 2 worldwide in offshore wind. By 2030, RWE intends to grow its global offshore wind capacity from currently    3 gigawatts (GW) to 8 GW (capacity represents RWE’s share only). Also in Germany, the company is stepping up the pace: In the German North Sea RWE is pushing ahead with the development of four offshore wind projects with a total capacity of 1.5 GW – partly together with its Canadian partner. By 2030, RWE will invest up to 15 billion euros gross in the green energy sector in Germany.  For more information about the Kaskasi offshore project, please visit our website.

{"id":8915,"text":"RWE invests more than €5 billion in green technologies in current fiscal year     * New wind farms, solar plants and battery systems with an installed capacity of 1.2 gigawatts commissioned in the first half of 2022 – about 20% more electricity generated from renewables      * Green assets with a total capacity of 4.8 gigawatts currently under construction in 11 countries      * At €1.6 billion, adjusted net income exceeds level in first half of previous year    ### Essen, 11 August 2022  “In the first half of 2022 our earnings increased significantly, and on the back of this we have raised our forecast for the whole year. The earnings we are generating will benefit the energy transition. This year alone we are investing more than €5 billion in expanding our green portfolio, which is about 30% more than originally planned. We are investing in offshore and onshore wind, solar, batteries and in ramping up the hydrogen economy. All this is urgently needed in order to make energy supply more independent and climate-neutral.”   ####  Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE AG   RWE is actively forging ahead with the implementation of its Growing Green strategy. In the first half of 2022, the Group invested about €2 billion in the expansion of its green portfolio. Total investments will come to more than €5 billion by the end of 2022. The strong investment activity is paying off: in the first six months of the current year alone, new wind farms, solar plants and battery systems with a total net installed capacity of about 1.2 gigawatts (GW) were commissioned. This increase in capacity and better wind conditions led to RWE generating about 20% more electricity from renewables in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year. The company currently has projects with a total of 4.8 GW under construction. RWE will also acquire the hydrogen-ready 1.4 GW Magnum power station in the Netherlands.  Strong earnings performance in internationally focused core business  At €2,858 million, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) at Group level for the first half of 2022 clearly exceeded the previous year’s figure (H1 2021: €1,751 million). Adjusted EBIT was €2,104 million (H1 2021: €1,042 million).  Adjusted net income also showed an improvement, increasing to €1,566 million (H1 2021: €870 million). RWE thus confirms its provisional figures for the first half of 2022 and the outlook for the current year released on 27 July 2022. The dividend target of €0.90 per share for fiscal 2022 remains unchanged.  In its core business with the Offshore Wind, Onshore Wind\/Solar and Hydro\/Biomass\/Gas segments as well as Supply & Trading, RWE achieved adjusted EBITDA of €2,357 million in the first six months of 2022. The figure for the same period last year was €1,206 million.  Offshore Wind: Adjusted EBITDA in the Offshore Wind segment in the first half of 2022 totalled €632 million, compared to €459 million in the same period the previous year. This significant increase was due mainly to the commissioning of new capacities as well as higher wind levels compared to the previous year. For the current year, RWE expects adjusted EBITDA of between €1.35 billion and €1.6 billion in this segment.  Onshore Wind\/Solar: In the first six months of 2022, adjusted EBITDA in the Onshore Wind\/Solar segment reached €491 million. Earnings were negative in the same period the previous year on account of losses of approximately €400 million due to the extreme weather in Texas. Here, too, additional capacity and more favourable wind conditions had a positive impact. For the current year, RWE expects adjusted EBITDA of between €0.9 billion and €1.1 billion in this segment.  Hydro\/Biomass\/Gas: Adjusted EBITDA in the Hydro\/Biomass\/Gas segment more than doubled to €755 million (prior year: €297 million). This was mainly the result of higher earnings from stronger short-term asset optimisation and higher international generation margins. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment is expected to total between €1.4 billion and €1.7 billion for fiscal 2022.  Supply & Trading: At €545 million, earnings in Supply & Trading exceeded the already high figure of €525 million from the prior year. For the current year, RWE now expects adjusted EBITDA of significantly above €350 million in this segment.  RWE earns less in German coal and nuclear energy business  Adjusted EBITDA in the Coal\/Nuclear segment was €501 million, compared to €545 million for the same period in the previous year. This decline in earnings was expected on account of lower generation levels resulting from power station closures. In addition, electricity production by the German lignite and nuclear power stations had already been sold forward. For the year as a whole, the company expects adjusted EBITDA of between €650 million and €750 million in this segment.  Robust financial situation  The Group’s net assets as at the reporting date of 30 June 2022 totalled €1,892 million (31 December 2021: €360 million). The increase is mainly due to strong cash flows from operating activities and a reduction in provisions for pensions as a result of a market-induced increase in discount rates.

{"id":8916,"text":"RWE deploys innovative foundations to support first turbines on Rea onshore wind farm in Spain     * RWE uses resource-saving “Soft-Spot®” foundations for the first time   * First of nine wind turbines under construction    * Wind farm to be commissioned during winter of 2022: Suppling 30,000 Spanish households with green electricity     ### Essen, 16 August 2022  “Construction on our 17th wind farm in Spain is progressing well and we are on schedule. We want to connect Rea Unificado to the grid later this year to support the country in its energy transition. Rea is the first RWE wind farm where we are erecting our wind turbines on innovative 'Soft-Spot® foundations'. They allow us to significantly reduce both construction costs and CO2 emissions while increasing stability.”  ####  Katja Wünschel, CEO Onshore Wind and Solar Europe & Australia, RWE Renewables   In the north-east of Spain, in Soria, RWE is constructing its 40.8-megawatt Rea Unificado wind farm. The company is erecting nine turbines with a rated output of 4.53 megawatts each - by far the largest and most powerful in its Spanish fleet. After commissioning, Rea Unificado will be able to supply 30,000 Spanish households with green electricity.     In its 17th Spanish onshore project, RWE has used 'Soft-Spot® foundations' for the first time. Reinforced concrete spread foundations are used and placed on an EPS layer – an insulating material made of expanded polystyrene. Instead of transferring the loads to the subsoil, the EPS redistributes them to a donut-shaped surface. This increases stability and reduces the diameter of the foundation slabs and volume of the concrete used.      “I would like to thank our development and construction teams for making this innovation in Rea possible. We have been able to significantly reduce our construction effort and material costs and save several tonnes of CO2. Now we are entering the next, decisive construction phase and will successively erect all nine turbines,” explains Robert Navarro, President and CEO RWE Renewables Iberia.     “GES is delighted to support RWE in this new milestone. As an engineering and construction company, GES always applies the most suitable architectural and engineering solutions for the project. Therefore, GES' proposal to RWE for Rea Unificado wind farm was the implementation of a soft spot foundation model, which optimises the consumption of concrete and steel, making the project more cost-effective and environmentally more sustainable. GES is excited to be able to collaborate with RWE in future challenges like this one”, Alfonso Rey, Wind Project Construction Manager at GES, explains.     The Rea Unificado wind farm is scheduled to be fully operational by the end of the year. Furthermore, RWE is currently constructing two Spanish solar parks with a total capacity of 88 megawatts.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE deploys innovative foundations to support first turbines on Rea onshore wind farm in Spain ","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2022-08-16-rwe-deploys-innovative-foundations-to-support-first-turbines-on-rea-onshore-wind","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/Pressarticle\/PDF\/2022\/08\/2022-08-16-rwe-deploys-innovative-foundations-to-support-first-turbines-on-rea-onshore-wind-en-RWE.pdf?sc_lang=en","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":8919,"text":"thyssenkrupp Elevator North America has launched a robotics interface platform to assist with robot delivery services throughout buildings. By incorporating the elevator interface with delivery robots, building owners and managers can improve inhouse logistics, increase productivity and maximize the tenant experience. \nPreviously, robots could not operate independently and use elevators, severely limiting their use within a multi-story building. Now, thyssenkrupp’s sophisticated interface allows communication between the robot and the elevator, which enables robots to make floor selections and use elevators like a normal passenger. \n“thyssenkrupp Elevator is helping shape the smart cities of the future with our innovative technologies and solutions that make passenger movement safer and more efficient for everyone, including robots,” said Kevin Lavallee, CEO of thyssenkrupp Elevator North America. \nSuccessful pilot projects have been completed at prominent hotels and hospitals across the U.S., as thyssenkrupp has partnered with leading robot manufacturers on these pilot projects. Robotic elevator interfaces can be implemented to assist with housekeeping, room and luggage service; assist robotic security guards and concierges; as well as aid in pharmaceutical and package delivery.\nThe interface permits robots to act like human passengers, placing a call for an elevator via WiFi or 4G LTE, selecting a floor and then exiting the elevator upon reaching its destination. Using Machine Vision, a robot can determine if an elevator has enough room or if it’s too full to accommodate the robot. \nAll elevator communication is done wirelessly through thyssenkrupp’s TAC family of controllers. The interface, which is only compatible with thyssenkrupp software and hardware, can be installed in as little as one day. \nAccording to MarketsandMarketsTM, the delivery robot market is expected to grow from $11.9 million USD in 2018 to $34 million USD in 2024. Hotels are increasingly testing this technology due to labor savings, increased revenue from room service as well as increased occupancy and room rates. Meanwhile, hospitals are utilizing robots for deliveries to and from pharmacies, laboratories, blood banks, nurse stations, waiting rooms, patient rooms, administrative offices and gift shops.\n“Technology-savvy organizations in pursuit of improved operational efficiencies are embracing the virtually unlimited potential of this technology and how they can implement robots and the elevator interface into their day-to-day activities,” continued Lavallee.\nThis is not thyssenkrupp Elevator’s first foray into the world of robotics. In 2017, thyssenkrupp announced the launch of pilot project in which delivery robots would transport spare parts and other materials from the warehouse to elevator maintenance job sites faster and more efficiently. \nIn addition to robotics, thyssenkrupp has recently launched two technological advancements poised to revolutionize elevator efficiency – MAX and AGILE. MAX is the elevator industry’s first real-time, cloud-based predictive maintenance solution that identifies issues before they occur, increasing elevator availability and reducing downtime. There are currently more than 130,000 units installed worldwide.\nMeanwhile, the AGILE elevator enhancement package allows building managers to more intelligently group and assign passengers to elevators, move people more rapidly to their destination, adjust passenger flow in real-time and personalize touchscreens and kiosks. AGILE bridges the gap between traditional elevator systems and the elevators of the future by providing a smart environment of unprecedented connectivity and personalization.\nPress images available below this hyperlink (credit: thyssenkrupp Elevator).  \n  \nPress Contact\nDr. Jasmin Fischer   \nHead of Global Media Relations  \nthyssenkrupp Elevator AG  \nTel: +49 201 844-563054  \nE-Mail: jasmin.fischer@thyssenkrupp.com  \nWeb:","company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2019-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","title":"thyssenkrupp launches elevator interface to allow multi-level robot movement throughout hotels, hospitals and other buildings","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Products and solutions","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/thyssenkrupp-launches-elevator-interface-to-allow-multi-level-robot-movement-throughout-hotels--hospitals-and-other-buildings-16640.html","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":8931,"text":"Slated for completion soon, the 280m-long Skybridge is an elevated scenic walkway that will link Perth’s Airport to a new train station being constructed, enhancing the efficiency of public transport to and from the airport. Several iwalks by thyssenkrupp Elevator will be installed, together with another three elevators that have the capacity to each transport up to 66 passengers.\nCommencing installation in August 2019, two of the four iwalks will extend 92m after completion – the longest iwalks that thyssenkrupp has ever manufactured. The remaining two are 38m in length. The iwalks will have the capacity to transport 7,300 passengers per hour, to support the anticipated 20,000 trips a day that the Forrestfield-Airport link is expected to carry when fully running by 2021, according to the Public Transport Authority of Western Australia.\n“thyssenkrupp Elevator was selected as a result of a long and strong relationship between the airport’s builders and the company. Right from the start and due to the iwalks’ shallow pit for the hovering slimline bridge, we identified the iwalks as an appropriate solution to providing an aesthetic benefit to the customer”, says Peter Walker, CEO thyssenkrupp Elevator. He adds: “Innovations move our business forward, especially in the digital era and space. However, our company as well as our customers only gain value from innovations when they help us to be more efficient and provide faster and better services. With Australia’s first iwalks by thyssenkrupp, we turn innovations into profitable growth.”\nPerth Airport is the largest airport in Western Australia. In 2016, after recent expansions and projects, it was awarded Capital City airport of the year by the Australian Airports Association. In 2018, it was named best airport in Australia for overall service quality by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\nJust in time for the Christmas travel season, thyssenkrupp technicians put into operation two iwalks at Melbourne Airport, Terminal 4. Two more are scheduled for installation in March 2020. Here, the biggest structural challenge was to install new moving walks within the existing structure and without creating a new pit. With the support of thyssenkrupp Elevator Australia, a feasibility study was done by a group of experts including structural engineers and architects. It was confirmed that thyssenkrupp iwalks were the most suitable product for this project. \nGiven the extremely tight timeline, two of the Melbourne iwalks were flown from Spain in to Australia and delivered in less than 20 weeks from the date the order was received. \nthyssenkrupp’s iwalk, the next-generation moving walk, perfectly fits the airports’ ambitious expansions and upgrades. The spectacular Skybridge at Perth Airport ensures maximum passenger comfort and efficiency when moving from plane to train, or vice versa. Airports are an elementary component of urban mobility – especially when linked to a railway that takes the travellers directly to the city and therewith is an attractive alternative to going by car. \nOne of thyssenkrupp’s key objective is to improve every airport’s efficiency and every traveller’s experience. The company is proud to be making airports smarter around the world by \n  * seamlessly moving 1.8 billion people through its passenger boarding bridges every year \n  * having installed more than 5,000 global gate solutions at over 370 airports worldwide and\n  * operating and maintaining over 1000 passenger boarding bridges worldwide.\niwalks are a cutting-edge solution to the challenge of transporting people, trolleys, and the like. With 30 percent less weight compared to conventional solutions, they revolutionise the way that walks are developed, manufactured and installed. The iwalk’s modular, compact design is tailored to fit the evolving requirements of space, with reduced weight and outer dimensions to produce thinner floors, requiring less building space, whilst offering enhanced convenience and comfort of passengers due to a wider pallet. \nPress images are available for download here.

We will reduce the company’s debt as far as is necessary and at the same time invest as much as is reasonable in its further development.”\nthyssenkrupp sells its Elevator Technology business entirely to a consortium led by Advent, Cinven and RAG foundation. The respective Executive Board decision was approved on Thursday evening by the Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp AG. The purchase agreement has been signed. Closing of the transaction is expected by the end of the current fiscal year. The purchase price is €17.2 billion. thyssenkrupp will reinvest part of the purchase price[1] (€1.25 billion) in a stake in the elevator business. The transaction is subject to merger control approvals, although thyssenkrupp does not expect the competent authorities to have any reservations. The proceeds from the transaction will remain within the company and are to be used to the extent necessary to strengthen the balance sheet. Alongside this, the proceeds shall be used to advance the development of the remaining businesses and the portfolio. As announced at the Annual General Meeting at the end of January, thyssenkrupp is proceeding the analysis phase so that a decision on the concrete use of funds can be taken in May.\nMartina Merz, CEO of thyssenkrupp AG: “With the sale, we are paving the way for thyssenkrupp to become successful. Not only have we obtained a very good selling price, we will also be able to complete the transaction quickly. It is now crucial for us to find the best possible balance for the use of the funds. We will reduce thyssenkrupp’s debt as far as is necessary and at the same time invest as much as is reasonable in developing the company. With this, thyssenkrupp can pick up speed again.”\nThe sale of Elevator is a favorable solution not only for the company, its shareholders, customers and employees, but also for the elevator business itself. In the consortium, thyssenkrupp has found new owners for the elevator business who have extensive industrial expertise and offer the workforce a high degree of security. The buyers have a strong track record in profitably growing and nurturing companies to become global champions.\nIn negotiations with employee representatives and the IG Metall trade union, the buyers have committed to far-reaching site and employment guarantees. In addition, it was agreed that the buyers will continue to manage thyssenkrupp Elevator as a global group. The company will also remain based in Germany and employee co-determination will continue. That means the solution is in line with thyssenkrupp's understanding of corporate and social responsibility.\n“We are not pleased to part with our employees and the elevator business. Nevertheless, today is a good day for everyone involved. With this step, we are opening up real prospects for the future: for the elevator business as an independent company and, with the financial solidity we have gained, also for all other areas of thyssenkrupp,\" Martina Merz added.\nTransaction strengthens thyssenkrupp’s equity base \nthyssenkrupp aims to use the cash inflow to the extent necessary to cut debt and to lower structural costs. Specifically, the company’s pension obligations are to be partially funded. For this purpose, funds shall be brought under a legally independent trust. It is planned that alongside cash the reinvestment in the elevator business will be transferred to the trust so that it can participate in the expected value uplift of the business. Furthermore, thyssenkrupp plans to use a part of the proceeds to reduce financial debt significantly. As a result, annual cash outflow for interest and pension payments are expected to be significantly reduced. Thus, the company’s structural costs could be considerably lowered. This would largely compensate for the future loss of positive cash contributions from the elevator business. \nUpon closing of the transaction, thyssenkrupp AG’s equity base will be significantly strengthened. The company is aiming for an investment-grade rating. In addition, thyssenkrupp works towards regaining the ability for a regular dividend payout. Free cash flow before M&A is to be improved and brought into positive figures within the next two years.\nRapid implementation of Group restructuring targeted \nWith its regained financial solidity, thyssenkrupp will have greater scope to implement its transformation. The primary goal is rapid and substantial improvement in the performance of the businesses (“performance first”). The necessary measures are by large extent already identified and are currently being implemented. \nIn addition, thyssenkrupp has announced that it will draw up specific plans for the further development of the various businesses and present them to the Supervisory Board in May. On this basis, thyssenkrupp then intends to make portfolio decisions such as which businesses it will continue to develop on its own, which are more likely to attain a leading position in an alliance and which would develop better under new ownership. thyssenkrupp will thus be in a position to consequently move forward with the implementation of the measures and the restructuring of the company once payment of the purchase price has been received.\n[1] assuming closing on June 30, 2020\nInformation to media:  On the occasion of the Supervisory Board resolution on the full sale of the elevator business we invite you to a press call with the Executive Board of thyssenkrupp AG on Friday, February 28, 2020 at 9:00 a.m.\nPlease dial into the conference by calling +49 69 2017 44 220.\nYour participant code is: 94681226#\nYou can find current video footage here.\nMedia Contact: \nthyssenkrupp AG Communications\nPeter Sauer \nPhone: +49 (201) 844-536791 \nmailto: press@thyssenkrupp.com \nthyssenkrupp Elevator AG Communications\nMichael Ridder\nPhone: +49 (201) 845-535104\nmailto: michael.ridder@thyssenkrupp.com","company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2020-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","title":"thyssenkrupp sells Elevator Technology business for €17.2 billion to consortium of bidders led by Advent, Cinven and RAG foundation","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Capital market-relevant press releases","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/thyssenkrupp-sells-elevator-technology-business-for--17-2-billion-to-consortium-of-bidders-led-by-advent--cinven-and-rag-foundation-19840.html","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":8942,"text":"* Technology from thyssenkrupp reduces carbon dioxide emissions in cement production by up to 40 percent \n  * New cement plant in Kribi, Cameroon will save 120,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year\nthyssenkrupp is to fit the first cement plant with a system for the production of calcined clay for the Dutch-based company Cimpor Global Holdings. The technology developed by thyssenkrupp lowers CO2 emissions in cement production by up to 40 percent. It involves replacing part of the cement clinker with calcined, i.e. thermally activated, clay. Cimpor Global Holdings will use the technology, known as “polysius activated clay”, on an industrial scale at a new plant being built near the Cameroon sea port of Kribi. On completion in fall 2021, the plant will save more than 120,000 tons of CO2 emissions every year.\nAn important building material, cement is produced by an energy-intensive process in which large quantities of carbon dioxide are emitted. “At thyssenkrupp we are convinced that CO2-neutral cement production is fundamentally possible and can be achieved in several steps,” says Pablo Hofelich, CEO of the Cement Technologies business unit. “We are already very advanced in many areas on the technology side. We offer our customers products that reduce environmental impact and at the same time reduce costs, making it possible for example to significantly cut CO2 and nitrogen oxide emissions and reduce the use of raw materials, water, or fossil fuels such as coal and gas.” \nUnder the order, thyssenkrupp is carrying out engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of the new plant, which will produce 720 tons of activated clay per day. It is the second calcined clay project of Cimpor Global Holdings.\nActivated clay significantly reduces CO2 footprint and energy consumption\nCO2 is a natural constituent of limestone, the main component of cement. For each ton of cement clinker produced, around 790 kilograms of process-related CO2 is emitted. Around two thirds of this results from the limestone used, which releases CO2 in a chemical reaction in the production process. At the same time the process requires large amounts of energy, because for the production of cement clinker, limestone has to be heated with other aggregates to temperatures of more than 1,400 degrees Celsius. \nWith polysius activated clay, thyssenkrupp has developed a technology that allows around one third of the cement clinker to be replaced with activated clay. The clay is heated to around 800 degrees Celsius – significantly less heat than is needed to produce clinker. Thanks to the significant energy saving in the production of thermally activated clays and the changed chemical composition, CO2 emissions per ton of cement can be cut by up to 40 percent. \nReduced dependence on expensive clinker imports\nClay is available in huge quantities worldwide – particularly also in developing countries with growing cement demand such as in Southeast Asia and large parts of Africa and Latin America. In the past clay has often been discarded as a waste product in mining. With polysius activated clay technology, thyssenkrupp offers an innovative solution for the industrial use of clay as a substitute material and a sustainable, low-cost alternative to conventional cement clinker. \n“Our technology is not only eco-friendlier, it also creates cost advantages for our customers such as Cimpor Global Holdings,” says Dr. Luc Rudowski, Head of Product Management and Innovation at the Cement Technologies business unit. “In many regions, limestone is in short supply and clinker has to be imported at high cost. Also, stricter environmental requirements and emissions levies in more and more countries are forcing cement producers to rethink. They need an alternative that is cost-efficient and at the same time delivers high-quality cement. That’s exactly what polysius activated clay technology provides.” \nClimate-neutral cement production a step closer\nAlongside technology for the production of thermally activated clays, thyssenkrupp is working on further products and processes for the “green” cement plant of the future. One example is Oxyfuel technology. While the use of activated clay helps substantially reduce CO2 emissions and energy consumption, a certain amount of limestone is still needed because it is essential for the strength behavior of concrete.\nWith its pure oxyfuel process, thyssenkrupp has developed a solution for capturing and utilizing the CO2 released from the limestone during clinker production. Instead of ambient air, pure oxygen is used for the combustion process.

{"id":8943,"text":"* Olpe plant will close by end of 2021\n  * Realignment of production site in Hagen\n  * Restructuring will impact around 490 jobs in Germany\n\nthyssenkrupp today approved an extensive restructuring plan for the German sites of its Springs and Stabilizers business unit. Under the plan, production of stabilizers at the Olpe site will be discontinued by the end of 2021. The Hagen site will be realigned and converted into a center of excellence for the development and manufacture of springs and stabilizers. Around 490 jobs will be impacted by the restructuring of the Olpe and Hagen sites, some 330 of them at Olpe. In the coming weeks agreements are to be reached with the employee representatives on a reconciliation of interests and a social plan for the two sites.\nDr. Karsten Kroos, CEO of thyssenkrupp’s Automotive Technology division: “The restructuring of the two sites is an unavoidable and right step to return the business to profit. The two plants were no longer competitive in the current setup. Price levels in the respective product segments are too low and overcapacities on the market too high. That is why we have decided to combine the remaining production and development activities at one site and further streamline the organization.”\nA permanent workforce of around 330 employees is currently employed at the site in Olpe. Existing customer projects will be completed by the end of 2021 and production then discontinued. Over the course of this year and next, targeted measures will be implemented to prepare employees for subsequent employment within the Group or elsewhere. Details of the package of measures and support will be determined in discussions with the employee representatives in the coming weeks.\nThe Hagen site has been producing springs for customers in the automotive industry since 1925. A permanent workforce of around 400 employees is currently employed here. In the future, all development and production capacities of the Springs and Stabilizers group in Germany will be concentrated in Hagen. This will include prototyping, production of stabilizers for small-batch orders and the spare parts business, and the production of springs for heavy cars and electric vehicles. To this end the site’s entire production strategy will be revised and switched to a higher degree of automation. The optimization of production processes will result in the elimination of around 160 jobs at the Hagen site by early 2022. The details of a socially responsible restructuring process will be determined in the upcoming negotiations with the works council and trade unions.\nthyssenkrupp’s Springs and Stabilizers business currently operates nine production sites in Germany, Hungary, Brazil, Mexico and China and employs around 3,400 people worldwide. Last year this business unit was designated by the Group as a “business under review” following a clearly negative performance over the past fiscal years. The business unit is suffering in particular from declining prices for springs and stabilizers and global overcapacities in this product segment. The restructuring of the German sites is an important step to restore the business unit’s competitiveness.\nthyssenkrupp in the automotive sector\nthyssenkrupp is one of the leading suppliers and engineering partners to the international auto industry.

{"id":8948,"text":"* CO2 emissions from iron production to be reduced\n  * 100 MW electrolyzer could cover 70% of H2 requirement of a thyssenkrupp blast furnace\n  * Rapid implementation of National Hydrogen Strategy helpful for investment decisions\nGreen hydrogen from an RWE Generation electrolyzer could help thyssenkrupp Steel Europe sustainably reduce CO2 emissions from steel production in the future. The energy company and the steel producer have agreed to work together towards a longer-term hydrogen partnership. The first hydrogen is set to flow to the Duisburg steel mill by the middle of the decade.\nHydrogen from Lingen for steel production in Duisburg\nThe hydrogen required for iron production is to be produced by electrolysis, in which water is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen. The companies agree that only electricity from renewable sources should be used to operate the electrolyzers. At its power plant site in Lingen RWE is already planning to build electrolysis capacities that could supply green hydrogen for the iron production of Germany’s biggest steelmaker. A 100 MW electrolyzer could produce 1.7 tons of gaseous hydrogen per hour, corresponding to around 70 percent of the quantity required by the Duisburg steelmaker’s blast furnace earmarked for hydrogen use. This would translate theoretically into around 50,000 tons of climate-neutral steel. The conversion of the blast furnace is to be carried out by 2022 - the first important stage of a fundamental transformation process at the end of which the company’s entire steel production will be carbon-neutral.\nImportant signal: German government adopts National Hydrogen Strategy\nOne of the prerequisites for the collaboration is the development of a dedicated hydrogen network to transport the gaseous hydrogen from Lingen to tkSE’s steel mill site in Duisburg. Pipeline transport of the hydrogen is the most economical delivery option. In dialogue with gas network operators and the authorities, RWE and tkSE therefore want to drive solutions for timely network connection. They believe hydrogen pipeline transport will be possible on the basis of regulations corresponding largely to those currently applying to natural gas delivery. The GETH2 initiative, in which RWE is involved, is already promoting corresponding solutions. The gas network development plan published on May 4, 2020, in its “green gas variant”, for the first time includes calculations for initial hydrogen sections parallel to the natural gas network. \nRoger Miesen, CEO of RWE Generation, says: “Hydrogen is of central importance for greenhouse gas abatement in Germany. The National Hydrogen Strategy and the €9 billion funding to be made available will give this future technology the necessary kick-start. In order for a hydrogen infrastructure in Germany to really pick up speed, rapid implementation is now needed, because investment decisions for green hydrogen projects need planning certainty.”\nBernhard Osburg, Chairman of thyssenkrupp Steel: “The planned cooperation with RWE is an important step on our path to climate neutrality. The aimed-for supply quantity would be largely sufficient to supply a blast furnace with green hydrogen and allow the production of climate-neutral steel for around 50,000 cars per year. This shows that climate-neutral steel is possible and we are pressing ahead with the conversion of our production. Nowhere else than in the steel industry can hydrogen be used with a comparable climate protection effect. We therefore expressly welcome the adoption of the National Hydrogen Strategy.”\nBackground\nHydrogen is a central component of the German government’s decarbonization strategy. The lightest element in the periodic table can not only replace fossil fuels and raw materials – it also allows flexible, supply-oriented storage of renewable energies. Under the “National Hydrogen Strategy” of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, up to five gigawatts of electrolysis capacity for hydrogen production is to be created and the hydrogen transport and distribution infrastructure further developed by 2030. Through targeted support and relief the ministry wants to make hydrogen economically viable for producers and users.\nFurther Information\nthyssenkrupp Steel climate website\nhttps:\/\/","company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2020-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Green hydrogen for steel production: RWE and thyssenkrupp plan partnership","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Products and solutions","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pressdetailpage\/green-hydrogen-for-steel-production--rwe-and-thyssenkrupp-plan-partnership-82841","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["unsure"]}
{"id":8949,"text":"* thyssenkrupp Elevator focuses on three pillars: Clean, Touchless, and Social Distancing\n  * The solutions will pave the way for further innovations in the mobility industry\nAs cities across the world ease Coronavirus lockdown restrictions, it is important to ensure that elevators used by millions of people every day remain a comfortable, efficient and secure way of transportation. thyssenkrupp Elevator offers several options to create a clean and healthy car environment, aiming to reduce the risk of virus transmissions.\nTo ensure peace of mind for passengers, the company is focusing on three pillars: hygiene technologies, social distancing, and touchless technologies to prevent infection in elevators and escalators in public places. Many of the resulting innovations will remain relevant even after the pandemic.\n“The pandemic is definitely accelerating some interesting trends in the elevator industry. thyssenkrupp Elevator is well equipped for the current challenges. We have been exploring several technologies in recent years, such as smart spaces monitoring, remote operation, robots for sanitizing spaces and many more. Today, we have appropriate solutions to protect passengers during the pandemic. Moreover, we also provide innovative technologies for tomorrow that go beyond today’s urban mobility,” says Peter Walker, CEO of thyssenkrupp Elevator.\nRegarding the first pillar “clean technologies”, the offerings range from handrail sanitization to thermal cameras to detect infected passengers. To clean the air in the cabins efficiently, thyssenkrupp Elevator uses air purification with special filters as well as UV-based solutions.\n“Touchless technologies” are highly relevant, too. Using a special kick button the passenger can call a cabin with a simple toe tap instead of touching a pad or button by hand. Experts foresee that touchless technologies will achieve a high adaption in many areas. Forwarding-thinking technologies like the kick button are therefore solutions that are here to stay.\n“Social Distancing” as the third pillar of thyssenkrupp’s strategy to fight the pandemic has led to the development of a special Social Distancing Service including traffic monitoring for elevator systems. This service helps tenants stay safe by limiting elevator passengers per cabin, so physical distance can be maintained. With the Social Distancing Service, thyssenkrupp Elevator assesses the elevator traffic to help balance building congestion risks with social distancing needs. Based on the needs, the company changes the dispatching software to limit the number of passengers assigned to each elevator car. Using data captured by the predictive maintenance IoT solution MAX, thyssenkrupp also provides data and information about traffic changes, so passenger wait times and social distancing needs can be balanced.\nFurther press material is available for download here.\n  \nAbout us:\nthyssenkrupp Elevator\nthyssenkrupp Elevator brings together the Group’s global activities in passenger transportation systems.

{"id":8955,"text":"* Weeks of stoppages and slump in auto sector impact in particular materials and components businesses\n  * Structural challenges continue to weigh on steel business\n  * Sales of continuing operations after 9 months down 15 percent year-on-year\n  * Adjusted EBIT in Q3 significantly negative at €(679) million due to sales slump and resulting capacity underutilization\n  * Q4 performance expected to be stable quarter-on-quarter; for full year negative adjusted EBIT between €1.7 billion and €1.9 billion likely\n  * Cash inflow from elevator transaction in Q4 will significantly strengthen balance sheet\n  * CEO Martina Merz: “With the proceeds from the elevator transaction we can now at last systematically address overdue measures”\nthyssenkrupp’s performance in the first 9 months of the current fiscal year was significantly impacted by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. As a result of temporary plant closures at customers, production in many areas came almost to a halt at the start of the 3rd quarter. The materials and components businesses dependent on the auto industry were particularly hard hit. Added to this were structural challenges in the steel business in an already difficult general market environment.\nAgainst this background order intake[1] in the first 9 months of the current fiscal year decreased year-on-year by 19 percent to €19.8 billion. Sales were down by 15 percent to €21.6 billion. Despite immediate countermeasures in response to the coronavirus pandemic, adjusted EBIT after 9 months at €(1,122) million was significantly lower than a year earlier (€42 million). Particularly impacted by the pandemic, the 3rd quarter alone accounts for adjusted EBIT of €(679) million. In its last forecast thyssenkrupp expected a loss for the period April to June in the high three-digit million euro range and could not rule out a figure of up to a good €1 billion.\n“We have worked hard to keep our costs under control and secure liquidity. As a result we came through the crisis slightly better than initially feared in the third quarter overall,” said Martina Merz, Chief Executive Officer of thyssenkrupp AG. “While we are now seeing signs of stabilization, the forthcoming restructurings and cleaning up of the balance sheet will continue to weigh on earnings in the current quarter. With the proceeds from the elevator transaction we can now at last systematically address these overdue measures.”\nGreatest possible flexibility in allocation of funds\nIn view of the uncertain economic situation caused by the coronavirus, the company will continue to retain the greatest possible flexibility in the concrete allocation of funds from the elevator transaction. Part of the proceeds will be used selectively to develop and restructure businesses where attractive target returns can be achieved in the short term. In addition, thyssenkrupp will repay financial liabilities in line with their maturity profile. Also, the significant fluctuations in net working capital during the course of the year are to be normalized, in particular through reduced use of year-end measures and factoring.\nKlaus Keysberg, Chief Financial Officer of thyssenkrupp AG: “Normalizing net working capital will improve comparability between quarters. This will provide greater transparency and make our forecasts more dependable. This will impact our cash flow in the current fiscal year in an amount of altogether around 2.5 billion euros. A year-on-year comparison will thus not be meaningful.”\nPerformance of the businesses in the first 9 months 2019\/2020\nAutomotive Technology was hit particularly hard by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The collapse in demand in the world’s biggest auto market China in February was followed from March by further plant shutdowns by big customers as a result of the lockdown particularly in Europe, the US, and Mexico. In China there were signs of a slight recovery from the end of April after the easing of restrictions. Order intake and sales in the first 9 months were down year-on-year by 14 percent and 12 percent respectively. This decline is also reflected in operating income. Adjusted EBIT at €(157) million was significantly lower than a year earlier (€17 million).\nAt Industrial Components the bearings unit continued to perform strongly thanks in particular to the good order situation for wind energy in Germany and China. The forgings business – operating in an already weak market for truck and construction machinery components – was impacted by slowdowns at all major plants in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Overall order intake and sales were down by 21 percent and 17 percent respectively. Adjusted EBIT at €122 million was lower than a year earlier (€168 million).\nPlant Technology increased its sales in the first 9 months by 6 percent, with a major contribution coming from chemical plant engineering. Compared with the prior year, which included major mining equipment and fertilizer plant orders, order intake was 38 percent lower, mainly as a result of pandemic-related project deferrals. Despite sales increases in chemical plant engineering, stable service business and positive effects from the cost-saving program, adjusted EBIT decreased to €(135) million (prior year €(114) million). Negative impacts included lower sales due to slower progress on cement projects and deferrals in order intake as a result of the pandemic.\nOrder intake at Marine Systems was down by 7 percent. Sales too were 9 percent lower at €1.2 billion, reflecting temporarily slower progress on submarine projects. However, buoyed by performance measures, adjusted EBIT was positive at €6 million (prior year: €0 million).\nMaterials Services continued to feel the effects of pandemic-related weak demand and declining prices in virtually all product segments, in particular in the 3rd quarter. The exception was plastics, which profited above all from the sale of transparent plastic sheets as protection against coronavirus. The pandemic-related temporary closure of the Italian stainless steel plant AST from the second half of March had a negative impact. Order intake and sales each decreased by 18 percent. The situation particularly in warehousing and distribution, the auto-related service centers and at aerospace weighed on business and led to negative earnings effects. Accordingly, adjusted EBIT was down year-on-year at €(62) million (prior year: €119 million).\nThe performance of Steel Europe was again characterized by the extremely challenging situation in the steel sector. Demand from the auto industry, which was already noticeably lower in March, slumped further in the course of the 3rd quarter, also due to declining order volumes from other industrial customers. The performance of the packaging steel operations was stable. Overall, order intake and sales after 9 months were down 24 and 20 percent respectively from the prior year. As a result of declining shipments and continuing cost pressure, adjusted EBIT slipped further into negative territory at €(706) million (prior year: €77 million). Launched in March, the Steel Strategy 20-30 aimed at sustainably improving competitiveness will now be implemented even more rigorously.\nPresented as a discontinued operation, the elevator business recorded order intake and sales level with the prior year in the first 9 months. While the new installations and service business in the USA performed positively, Elevator Technology saw declines in Asia and Europe due to the coronavirus pandemic. Adjusted EBIT at €613 million was slightly lower than a year earlier in particular due to the negative earnings effects in Europe (prior year: €642 million).\nKey figures first 9 months 2019\/2020 (full group)\nIn the first 9 months of the 2019\/2020 fiscal year thyssenkrupp (incl. discontinued operations) reports a net loss of €(1,978) million (prior year €(170) million). This was mainly due to weak operating performance as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Added to this are restructuring expenses for the implementation of the change process and expenses in connection with the elevator transaction. After deduction of minority interest the net loss was €(1,998) million (prior year: €(207) million); earnings per share came to €(3.21) (prior year: €(0.33).\nFree cash flow before M&A also remained clearly negative at €(3.5) billion, down €0.9 billion from the prior year. The main reasons for this were weak operating performance as a result of the pandemic and the payment of the fine in the heavy plate cartel case in the amount of the recognized provisions of €370 million.\nAs a result of the negative free cash flow before M&A and the effects of the remeasurement of lease liabilities in accordance with IFRS 16 in the amount of €1 billion recorded in the 1st quarter, net financial debt increased to €8.5 billion at June 30, 2020 (at September 30, 2019: €3.7 billion). At the end of June 2020 thyssenkrupp had available liquidity of €3.9 billion. Mainly due to the net loss, total equity at the reporting date was €2.2 billion lower than at September 30, 2019.\nThe closing of the sale of the elevator business on July 31, 2020 substantially improves the group’s balance sheet ratios. The payment of the purchase price results directly in a significant decrease in net financial debt and the creation of net financial assets, and a substantial increase in total equity.\nAt the beginning of May thyssenkrupp entered into a €1 billion credit facility under the KfW special program to secure liquidity during the coronavirus pandemic until the closing of the elevator transaction. The credit facility was not drawn and ended with the closing of the elevator transaction.\n2019\/2020 forecast\nDespite the cautious resumption of production following the easing of coronavirus measures in key industrial nations, international infection rates remain high and there is a continued risk of further waves of infection in the course of the year. For this reason and due to the continuing disruptions to economic and public life, forecasts for the remaining months of the fiscal year are still subject to major uncertainties.\nIt is already foreseeable that due to the temporary plant closures and production cutbacks by customers in the automotive industry, sales from continuing operations will decline significantly, above all in the 2nd half (prior year, continuing operations: €34.0 billion).\nDepending on the speed at which production is restarted by our customers, thyssenkrupp expects almost all businesses, with the possible exception of Steel Europe, to report a stable performance or a slight quarter-on quarter improvement in the 4th quarter. Nonetheless, adjusted EBIT from continuing operations is expected to be negative in the mid to high 3-digit million euro range. As a result, full-year negative adjusted EBIT of between €1.7 billion and €1.9 billion is likely. The year-on-year decline in earnings (prior year, continuing operations: €(110) million) is influenced heavily by the high loss in the steel operations of up to a good €1 billion (prior year, Steel Europe: €31 million).\nDue to operating performance and the charge from the normalization of net working capital in the amount of around €2.5 billion toward further continuous optimization, the forecast for free cash flow before M&A of continuing operations is between €(5.0) billion and €(6.0) billion (prior year, continuing operations: €(1,756) million.\nAs a result of the elevator transaction the free cash flow of the group and the net income of the group in the current fiscal year will be significantly positive. \n[1] Unless otherwise stated, all figures relate to the continuing operations, i.e. excluding the elevator business and individual units from Corporate Headquarters reported as discontinued operations.\nCurrent footage material can be found here.","company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2020-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"thyssenkrupp in first 9 months 2019\/2020 significantly down year-on-year due to coronavirus \/ stabilization expected in 4th quarter \/ elevator sale strengthens balance sheet","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Capital market-relevant press releases","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pressdetailpage\/thyssenkrupp-in-first-9-months-2019-2020-significantly-down-year-on-year-due-to-coronavirus---stabilization-expected-in-4th-quarter---elevator-sale-strengthens-balance-sheet-86573","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":8960,"text":"* First project phase at thyssenkrupp’s Duisburg steel mill demonstrates technical feasibility and confirms commercial viability\n  * Second phase will focus on extension to other industries and making the technology market-ready\n  * Minister Karliczek hands over notice of 75 million euros funding for second phase\nThe Carbon2Chem® project initiated by thyssenkrupp is moving into its next phase. Involving 16 further partners the project, which is funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), has over the past four years gathered fundamental insights into the conversion of steel mill process gases into chemical products. The next step is to extend the solution to other industries, demonstrate its long-term stability and make it ready for the market. To this end, Federal Minister Anja Karliczek handed over notice of 75 million euros further funding for the period up to 2024.\nDecisive phase completed\nThe BMBF provided more than 60 million euros in funding for the first phase of the project in 2016. Since then, important milestones have been reached: shortly after the pilot plant in Duisburg started operation in March 2018, ammonia, methanol and higher alcohols were successfully produced from steel mill process gases for the first time. In addition to the CO2 from these gases, Carbon2Chem® also uses hydrogen. To pave the way for climate-neutral production, a two megawatt alkaline water electrolyzer from thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers was operated in the pilot plant. It was shown that the water electrolyzer could be operated with highly volatile renewable energy without suffering damage. The implementation of chemical synthesis using commercially available catalysts and gas cleaning using commercially available process stages by thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions is proof of the high technology readiness level (TRL) of the project. In addition, commercial viability as well as the positive ecological effect were confirmed by all project partners.\nNext phase: Extension to other industries and market readiness\nIn the now launched second phase of the project, the aim is to demonstrate long-term stability in the complex interactions between steel production and chemical synthesis, and show that the Carbon2Chem® technology can be upscaled quickly in a cross-industry network. In addition, the focus will be on transferability to other industries besides steel production. To this end, additional sectors are to be included in the project as major CO2 sources – for example cement and lime producers and waste incineration plants. Finally, the second phase of the project will serve to bring the project to market readiness.\nThe 75 million euros funding from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research paves the way for this next important step.\nAnja Karliczek, Federal Minister of Education and Research: \"Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. We must reduce CO2 emissions as quickly and effectively as possible. By 2050 we want to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent in the world. The Carbon2Chem project is a showcase example of how we can successfully meet this challenge with clever ideas and innovative research. The innovations from Carbon2Chem not only protect the climate – they also strengthen our long-term competitiveness and secure high-quality jobs in industry.\"\nDr. Klaus Keysberg, Chief Financial Officer of thyssenkrupp AG: “We would like to thank the Federal Ministry for its faith and support for our climate technologies. Carbon2Chem® can help CO2-intensive industries in particular on the road to climate neutrality – this applies not just to steel but also, for example, to cement or lime production. We are already seeing worldwide interest in this technology. With this continued funding, the joint project can now be developed to market readiness. In just a few years we want to use Carbon2Chem® on an industrial scale.”\nCarbon2Chem® an integral part of thyssenkrupp’s decarbonization strategy\nCarbon2Chem® is already an integral part of thyssenkrupp Steel’s strategy for climate-neutral steel production. As well as avoiding CO2 emissions through the use of hydrogen in steel production, the company is banking on the technology to utilize and avoid residual emissions. Carbon2Chem® is expected to help reduce CO2 emissions at thyssenkrupp’s steel mill by 30 percent by 2030 on the path to complete climate neutrality by 2050.","company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2020-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Carbon2Chem®: First project phase successfully completed and notice of funding received from federal government for second phase","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Products and solutions","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pressdetailpage\/carbon2chem--first-project-phase-successfully-completed-and-notice-of-funding-received-from-federal-government-for-second-phase-88741","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

But we will have to take them.”  \nProgress with transformation into high-performing “Group of Companies”\nIn parallel with the immediate coronavirus measures, thyssenkrupp made further progress with the transformation of the company in the past fiscal year. The elevator business was successfully sold, significantly strengthening the company’s balance sheet. In addition, extensive restructurings were initiated – for example at System Engineering, Springs & Stabilizers and the cement plant and aerospace businesses. In the steel business, too, extensive restructurings have been underway since spring. To address the specific market situation and counter the effects of coronavirus, adjustments to the execution of the Steel Strategy 20-30 and also further cost reductions are currently being worked on.\nIn May 2019 the company announced a reduction of 6,000 jobs over three years necessary for the transformation of the group. As a result of the restructurings begun and implemented in the past year, around 3,600 jobs have already been cut. To address long-term market developments and the effects of coronavirus, thyssenkrupp currently sees the need for a further reduction of altogether 11,000 jobs – measured against the starting situation. These additional 7,400 jobs are to be reduced over the next three years.\nOliver Burkhard, Chief Human Resources Officer of thyssenkrupp AG: “We’re in the middle of the biggest restructuring process in the history of thyssenkrupp. Unfortunately, this will involve further job cuts, there is unfortunately no way around it. We will address this together with the employee representatives locally and find suitable instruments – depending on the scale and severity of the economic situation. Compulsory redundancies remain the last resort. However, we cannot explicitly rule them out at this time.”\nTalks on options in steel business proceeding to plan\nTo tackle the structural challenges in the steel business and push ahead with the transformation to green steel, thyssenkrupp is exploring various competing options. A fundamental decision on the steel business is expected to be made in spring 2021.\nProgress in Multi Tracks businesses\nthyssenkrupp made further progress in the Multi Tracks segment: The company has received indicative offers and a number of expressions of interest for various constellations in Plant Technology and for the stainless steel plant in Terni, Italy (AST). These are currently being examined in detail. In the Springs & Stabilizers and System Engineering businesses, thyssenkrupp is systematically continuing the initiated restructurings. A sale process is currently being prepared for Infrastructure. At Heavy Plate the likelihood of the agreed closure is increasing as there are no longer any interested parties in the bidding process. In the Chemical Process Technologies (CPT) business, thyssenkrupp is currently experiencing an enormous increase in demand and numerous project announcements. The unit is profiting from strong growth in demand for hydrogen technologies. thyssenkrupp is therefore examining how it can further strengthen CPT’s good starting position in this growing market through alliances.\nMartina Merz: “We have taken first forceful steps forward in the transformation of thyssenkrupp but we still have a good way to go. We will have to move further into the “red zone” before we have made thyssenkrupp fit for the future. There is still no certainty regarding what will happen with the coronavirus pandemic. For this reason we will work even harder in all units on improving performance. We will also strive to achieve a solution for the steel business and make decisions on the future of our Multi Tracks businesses.”\nClear strengthening of balance sheet through Elevator sale\nFor the 2019\/2020 fiscal year thyssenkrupp (incl. discontinued operations) reports net income of €9.6 billion (prior year: €260 million loss). This includes the gain from the sale of the elevator business of around €15 billion. This was partly offset by the weak operating performance caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic was also the main reason for further impairment losses: In the past fiscal year thyssenkrupp wrote down altogether around €3 billion on noncurrent assets – particularly at Steel Europe and Automotive Technology due to weaker medium-term demand from the automotive industry. In addition, net income was impacted by restructuring expenses of around €600 million. Earnings per share came to €15.40 (prior year: €(0.49)).\nDue to the net income achieved, thyssenkrupp’s equity increased to €10.2 billion at September 30, 2020 (prior year: €2.2 billion). As a result, the equity ratio improved to 28 percent (prior year: 6 percent).\nKlaus Keysberg, Chief Financial Officer of thyssenkrupp AG: “A strengthened balance sheet creates the basis for the future positioning of thyssenkrupp. We laid the foundation stone for the transformation of the company with the proceeds from the Elevator transaction. At the same time – as announced – we were able to reduce previously standard year-end measures for cash management to a normal level and as a result further improve the transparency and continuity of our business performance.”\nThe normalization of net working capital, announced in summer and implemented in the 4th quarter, impacted free cash flow before M&A in the amount of around €3 billion. Further negative factors were the payment of the fine in the Heavy Plate cartel case and the weaker operating performance due to the pandemic. Initial cash-out of around €200 million for the initiated restructurings also impacted the indicator. For the 2019\/2020 fiscal year thyssenkrupp thus reports free cash flow before M&A for the full group of €(4.8) billion (prior year: €(1.1) billion). On a continuing basis – i.e. excluding the cash contribution of the elevator business – free cash flow before M&A comes to €(5.5) billion (prior year: €(1.8) billion).\nAs a result of the cash inflow from the Elevator transaction in the amount of around €15 billion the group’s free cash flow was positive and at €9.1 billion significantly up year-on-year (prior year: €(1.3) billion). Taking into account the effects of the remeasurement of lease liabilities in accordance with IFRS 16 in the amount of €1 billion recorded in the 1st quarter, and the early repayment of a bond originally due in November 2020, thyssenkrupp reports net financial assets of €5.1 billion at September 30, 2020 (prior year: net financial debt of €3.7 billion). With cash and cash equivalents and undrawn committed credit lines totaling €13.2 billion, thyssenkrupp has a very good liquidity position.\nAs the parent-company financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG show an unappropriated loss, no dividend proposal will be presented for resolution to the Annual General Meeting for fiscal year 2019\/2020. Also against the background of the existing operating challenges there is no room for a dividend this year.\nCoronavirus pandemic impacts performance of the businesses\nWith the exception of the Steering unit – which profited from the ramp-up of new plants and projects – Automotive Technology suffered a significant drop in demand due to the pandemic. Order intake and sales fell year-on-year by 12 and 13 percent respectively. This decline was also reflected in operating income. Overall, adjusted EBIT at €(260) million was significantly down from the prior year (€(22) million).\nAt Industrial Components, the bearings business continued to perform strongly, in particular due to the good order situation in Germany and China in the wind energy sector. Business in the forgings unit was impacted – in an already weak market for truck and construction machinery components – by the temporary shutdown\/severely restricted operations of all major plants as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Overall, order intake and sales decreased by 21 and 17 percent respectively. Adjusted EBIT at €138 million was down from the prior year (€230 million).\nPlant Technology held its sales at almost the same level as the prior year. The chemical plant business performed very positively, while sales at the cement plant business were down from the prior year. Sales of the Mining and Service units were stable. Compared with the prior year, which was marked by major orders in the mining and fertilizer businesses, order intake fell by 41 percent, mainly due to restraint in the award of large projects. Nevertheless, the chemical plant business recorded growing interest in electrolysis plants and equipment. The cement plant business won orders in the USA and for a low-CO2 cement production plant in Cameroon. Despite the sales increases in chemical plant construction, the stable performance of the service business and positive effects from the cost reduction program, adjusted EBIT decreased to €(235) million (prior year: €(145) million). Higher construction site costs due to the pandemic and underutilization of project capacities were the main negative factors.\nOrder intake at Marine Systems was steady year-on-year, while sales decreased slightly by 3 percent. A temporary slowdown in progress on submarine projects had a negative impact. However, driven by measures to improve performance, adjusted EBIT came to €18 million, continuing the positive trend for the second year in succession (prior year: €1 million).\nMaterials Services felt the effects of weak demand and price falls in almost all product segments with the pandemic intensifying the negative trend from the second half of March. The only exception was the Plastics unit, which made gains above all through the sale of clear plastic sheeting as a protection against coronavirus. Negative effects also came from the temporary closure of the Italian stainless steel plant AST due to the pandemic. Order intake and sales declined significantly by 18 and 19 percent respectively. As a result adjusted EBIT at €(110) million was down from the prior year (€107 million).\nBusiness at Steel Europe continued to be marked by the extremely challenging situation on the steel market. Following an already noticeable drop in demand from the automotive industry at the beginning of the fiscal year, the effects of the coronavirus pandemic were increasingly felt in the course of the 3rd quarter. Overall, full-year order intake and sales were down year-on-year by 17 and 20 percent respectively. Due to the collapse in shipments and the cost pressure from weak capacity utilization, adjusted EBIT showed a loss of €(946) million compared with a profit of €31 million a year earlier.\nThe elevator business, presented as a discontinued operation, recorded order intake of €6.7 billion up to deconsolidation at July 31, 2020, a slight drop from the comparable prior-year period. While the new installations and service businesses performed positively in the USA, Elevator Technology recorded declines in Asia and Europe due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sales remained steady at €6.5 billion due to the positive performance in the USA. Adjusted EBIT at €693 million was down from the comparable prior year (€719 million), mainly due to the negative earnings effects in Europe and at Access Solutions.\nForecast 2020\/2021: significant improvement in adjusted EBIT\nDespite the still expected recovery of important markets and the visible structural improvement of the businesses, thyssenkrupp takes an overall cautious view of the current fiscal year 2020\/2021. The economic and geopolitical uncertainties give the group only limited planning reliability, especially in the cyclical materials and auto components businesses.\nDepending on the recovery of the global auto market the Executive Board expects sales growth in the low to mid single-digit percentage range (prior year: €28.9 billion).\nAgainst this background thyssenkrupp expects a significant year-on-year improvement in adjusted EBIT to a loss in the mid three-digit million euro range (prior year: pro forma[2] €(1.8) billion). With significant progress across all businesses the Multi Tracks segment will impact earnings with a loss in the low to mid three-digit million euro range (prior year: pro forma €(593) million) and Steel Europe with a loss in the low three-digit million euro range (prior year: pro forma €(820) million).\nDespite the significant operating improvements, as well as the absence of impairment losses on noncurrent assets from the prior year, thyssenkrupp expects a net loss of over €(1) billion (prior year: €(5.5) billion). This again includes expenses for further restructurings in the mid three-digit million euro range.\nFree cash flow before M&A is expected to improve significantly but still remain negative in the region of €(1.5) billion (prior year: €(5.5) billion). Multi Tracks is included in this with an amount in the low to mid three-digit million euro range and Steel Europe with a negative amount in the low three-digit million euro range. Inflows will come from operating improvements in all segments and depending on order intake inflows and the payment profile of projects at Marine Systems and the plant construction business. The absence of the charges from the normalization of net working capital and of the fine in the Steel Europe cartel case will also have a positive effect. Continuing restructuring cash-out in the low to mid three-digit million euro range will have a negative impact.\n[1] Unless otherwise stated, all figures relate to the continuing operations, i.e. excluding the elevator business reported as a discontinued operation and individual units from Corporate Headquarters.\n[2] From the 2020\/21 fiscal year, to improve transparency the definition of special items is more strictly in keeping with the treatment under IFRS. Adjustment items are restructuring expenses, impairment losses, and disposal gains\/losses.","company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2020-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"thyssenkrupp progressing well with transformation despite coronavirus pandemic \/ balance sheet significantly strengthened by Elevator sale \/ operating performance in 2019\/2020 fiscal year impacted by pandemic","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Capital market-relevant press releases","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pressdetailpage\/thyssenkrupp-progressing-well-with-transformation-despite-coronavirus-pandemic---balance-sheet-significantly-strengthened-by-elevator-sale---operating-performance-in-2019-2020-fiscal-year-impacted-by-pandemic-90401","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":8967,"text":"* 1st quarter order intake and adjusted EBIT higher year-on-year\n  * Performance measures taking effect: all segments except Multi Tracks with positive earnings\n  * 1st quarter free cash flow before M&A positive at €32 million\n  * Full-year forecast raised: almost break-even earnings expected\n  * Martina Merz: “We’re noticing signs of an economic recovery and our measures are starting to bear fruit. But we’re not out of the woods yet.”\nthyssenkrupp made a good start to the new fiscal year. In the 1st quarter 2020\/2021 the group of companies posted order intake[1] totaling €7.8 billion, up 6 percent against the comparable prior-year period – before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Sales from October to December amounted to €7.3 billion (prior year: €7.6 billion). Increasing revenues were recorded by the segments Industrial Components, Automotive Technology and Steel Europe. However, this could not offset partly pandemic-related decreases at Materials Services, Marine Systems and Multi Tracks. Adjusted EBIT at €78 million was significantly higher than the prior-year figure of €(185) million. All segments – except Multi Tracks[2] – made positive earnings contributions. In view of the good 1st quarter performance, thyssenkrupp has raised its earnings forecast: for the 2020\/2021 fiscal year the group now expects almost break-even adjusted EBIT (previously: expected loss in the mid three-digit million euro range).\n“In a continuing uncertain market environment, we had a good first quarter: we’re noticing signs of an economic recovery and our measures to improve performance in the businesses are starting to bear fruit. We’ve posted positive results, but we’re not out of the woods yet. Further efforts are needed to make thyssenkrupp into a powerful group of companies on a long-term basis. That’s why we’re continuing to press ahead with the transformation,” said Martina Merz, CEO of thyssenkrupp AG. \nPerformance of the segments in the 1st quarter 2020\/2021\nMaterials Services made further progress in implementing its strategic transformation in the 1st quarter. Among other things, the number of logistics sites was reduced and the share of service business was expanded as part of the ongoing network optimization. Overall the segment profited from an improved cost structure and productivity increases as well as from a significant price and volume recovery. Most regions and product units matched their prior-year figures. However, weak demand from the aerospace industry as well as lower stainless steel prices and changes to the product mix in direct-to-customer business had a negative impact on order intake and sales, which declined year-on-year by 10 percent and 12 percent respectively. Adjusted EBIT came to €5 million (prior year: €12 million).\nIndustrial Components increased its order intake by 19 percent and sales by 14 percent. The bearings unit continued to profit clearly from the good order situation in wind energy particularly in Germany and China. The forgings business, too, saw a significant recovery in both car and truck components and undercarriages for construction machinery after the pandemic-related global market collapse. In addition, productivity improved significantly and costs in purchasing and administration were reduced. As a result of the good market situation as well as effects from early and successful cost-reduction measures over the past two years, adjusted EBIT at €101 million was significantly higher than a year earlier (€44 million).\nAutomotive Technology achieved a 3 percent year-on-year improvement in both order intake and sales. The increases resulted mainly from the automotive original equipment business, supported by the ramp-up of new plants and projects, particularly for steering systems, and stable demand in China. In addition, a profitable order structure and efficiency gains in production – such as lower reject rates, non-conformance costs and cycle times – as well as positive effects from restructurings particularly at System Engineering Body led to a significant improvement in adjusted EBIT to €109 million (prior year: €46 million).\nIn a structurally extremely challenging market environment, order intake and sales at Steel Europe were up 17 percent and 7 percent respectively from the prior year. After the unprecedented pandemic-related demand slump in spring and summer 2020, business is now picking up again. Restocking at steel service centers, catch-up effects mainly at automotive customers, and good demand from appliance manufacturers and the construction sector are having a positive impact. As a result of increasing capacity utilization together with an improved product mix and initial effects from the ongoing restructuring with advancing personnel reduction and the initiated performance measures, adjusted EBIT improved significantly to €20 million (prior year: €(127) million). \nMarine Systems significantly improved its order intake in the first three months of the current fiscal year to €258 million (prior year: €109 million). Positive effects included the expansion of an order for a customer in Asia in the submarine sector and the acquisition of an electronics order for the Royal Navy. Sales were 6 percent lower at €364 million, reflecting pandemic-related temporary delays at suppliers. Adjusted EBIT increased to €5 million (prior year: €1 million).\nThe businesses in the Multi Tracks segment showed a very mixed picture in the 1st quarter: The stainless steel business recorded good demand, but market-related developments on the price and cost side impacted earnings. With limited declines, the plant construction business and the powertrain and battery assembly unit (System Engineering Powertrain) held up comparatively well in the market. In the heavy plate business, business was down ahead of the planned closure. Overall, order intake at Multi Tracks increased by 7 percent. By contrast, sales were significantly lower (down 17 percent), partly due to the focus on more attractive market segments and the cautious award of major new projects in the plant construction business and at System Engineering Powertrain. Adjusted EBIT totaled €(111) million (prior year €(92) million). Extensive performance and restructuring programs with clearly defined cost and personnel reduction targets were implemented and already had a significant loss-reducing effect. \nthyssenkrupp continues to make good progress as planned with the reduction of general and administrative costs at Corporate Headquarters. Adjusted EBIT at Corporate Headquarters improved to €(54) million (prior year: €(65) million).\n1st quarter 2020\/2021: Key figures for the full group (incl. discontinued operations)\nthyssenkrupp significantly increased its net income by €239 million to €(125) million in the 1st quarter 2020\/2021. On a continuing basis, i.e. adjusted for the earnings contribution of the sold elevator business, quarterly earnings improved by as much as €321 million. After deducting minority interest, net income in the 1st quarter was €(145) million (prior year: €(372) million); earnings per share came to €(0.23) (prior year: €(0.60)).\nThe increased adjusted EBIT and the significant reduction in the previously customary year-end measures implemented in the 4th quarter resulted in a significantly improved free cash flow before M&A of €32 million in the 1st quarter (prior year: €(2.5) billion). Accordingly, the group’s net financial assets were unchanged from the September 30, 2020 reporting date at €5.1 billion. With cash and cash equivalents and undrawn committed credit lines totaling €12.1 billion, thyssenkrupp continues to have a very good liquidity position.\nTotal equity decreased slightly from €10.2 billion at September 30, 2020 to €9.9 billion. In addition to the net loss for the period, there were negative effects from the lower interest rate level, which necessitated a remeasurement of pension obligations.\nForecast for fiscal year 2020\/2021 raised\nDespite the expected recovery of important markets and the visible structural improvements to the businesses, thyssenkrupp still feels it appropriate to offer a cautious outlook overall for the 2020\/2021 fiscal year. The economic and geopolitical uncertainties give the group only limited planning reliability for the cyclical materials businesses and for auto components, particularly in the second half of the current fiscal year.\nNevertheless, following the good start to the fiscal year the company has raised its full-year forecast:\nDepending in particular on the further progression of the coronavirus pandemic, sales will grow in the high single-digit percentage range, but will still remain well below the level prior to the pandemic (previous forecast: growth in the low to mid single-digit percentage range; prior year: €28.9 billion).\nMainly as a result of improved demand in the materials and automotive components businesses, thyssenkrupp expects a significant improvement in adjusted EBIT towards almost break-even (previously: loss in the mid three-digit million euro range; prior year: pro forma[3] €(1.8) billion).\nAs a result of earnings improvements in all segments, free cash flow before M&A is expected to improve more strongly than assumed at the start of the fiscal year and based on current estimates move towards €(1) billion (previously: around €(1.5) billion; prior year: €(5.5) billion).\nDespite clear operating improvements and the absence of impairment losses on non-current assets from the prior year, thyssenkrupp expects a net loss in the high three-digit million euro range (previously: net loss over €1 billion; prior year: €(5.5) billion). This will include expenses for restructurings in the mid three-digit million euro range.","company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2021-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","title":"thyssenkrupp starts 2020\/2021 fiscal year with tailwind and initial successes in performance improvement – earnings forecast raised","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Capital market-relevant press releases","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pressdetailpage\/thyssenkrupp-starts-2020-2021-fiscal-year-with-tailwind-and-initial-successes-in-performance-improvement--earnings-forecast-raised-94556","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}

{"id":8979,"text":"* Increased productivity through holistic digitization and automation\n  * € 60 million investment a milestone for \"Materials as a Service\" strategy\n  * Sustainability as an essential cornerstone in planning and processes\nthyssenkrupp Materials Services has put a new logistics center in Rotenburg, Lower Saxony, into operation. With an innovative concept it sets new industry standards and further enhances the company's performance. \"We want to be not only the best materials seller for our customers, but also the best supply chain manager,\" explains Martin Stillger, Spokesman of the Executive Board of thyssenkrupp Materials Services. \"In Rotenburg we are demonstrating what is now possible in the modern materials business thanks to automation, digitization and artificial intelligence: We connect production machineries of all generations, automate order processes, analyze materials flows and forecast our customers' materials requirements. Our new logistics site is therefore an important milestone in the implementation of our future strategy 'Materials as a Service'.\"\nThe largest mill-independent materials distribution and service provider in the western world has invested around € 60 million in the new logistics site. This makes it one of the biggest projects in recent decades and points the way to the future of the materials business. The warehouse layout of the site has been completely redesigned. The entire process chain has a high level of automation and digitization, increasing productivity and offering customers more and more individualized services. The concept is to serve as a blueprint for other sites in the future.\nLogistics process completely rethought\nThe underlying approach: The layout of the site is aligned with the optimum flow of materials and no longer has to take into account the ideal loading sequence of the trucks, as was previously the case. Driverless transport systems move the provided goods directly to the truck, which is loaded in bays at ground level. The time-consuming process of moving from one loading point to the next in the hall, which was common in the past, is no longer necessary. As a result, several trucks can be dispatched at the same time. \"This now not only allows us to process orders better and more closely to demand, but at the same time ensures more efficient processes, shorter downtimes and ultimately greater productivity with increased safety for employees,\" explains Dr. Tobias Hegmanns, Chief Operating Officer of thyssenkrupp Schulte.\nWhat is already common standard in other sectors is a novelty for materials trading: As the goods can be up to 20 meters long and weigh 10 tons, only the automation of the systems and the driverless transport systems have made it possible to implement the concept economically. The traffic in the storage and processing areas, which is reduced to a minimum, also reduces the risk of occupational accidents, and creates increased protection for employees. For customers, the new logistics center not only offers a wider range of materials, but also a more extensive processing portfolio. From cutting and sawing to foiling, individual services are realized in a short time.\nHolistic digital integration of the material flow\nThe site is digitally integrated and connected along the entire supply chain. Orders are processed digitally and paperlessly and can thus be ideally planned and tracked. The inhouse-developed IIoT platform \"toii\" is the heart of the digital processes at the site. By connecting the plants digitally, data is exchanged directly without any manual intermediate steps. As a result, the materials flow is controlled more efficiently and in line with demand. In addition, automation increases plant utilization by smoothly coordinating the modern processing stations. The data analytics platform \"alfred\" ensures that supply flows are optimally coordinated on an ongoing basis. Based on intelligent, self-learning algorithms, it permanently analyzes the processes – from incoming goods and inventory management to order storage and delivery.\nRole model for sustainability\nSustainability also played a decisive role in the planning of the new site – both in construction and supply chain management. The installation of a photovoltaic system will take place in the coming months. In the first stage, the aim is to generate electricity for the logistics center. In further expansion stages, electricity will also be generated for other sites of thyssenkrupp Materials Services. The area has its own rail line, which will be used three times a week to deliver materials by climate-friendly train track in the future. Order entry and processing will be mostly paperless. The new logistics concept also facilitates to plan routes, reduces downtimes, and significantly increases the utilization of truck capacity.\nWhat potential the Rotenburg concept can hold for Materials Services is illustrated by one figure: the company currently has 500 trucks on the roads every day in Germany alone. The goal is to further reduce the number through more efficient and demand-oriented planning.\nLogistics network for Northern Germany\nThe logistics center in Lower Saxony is part of the Materials Services subsidiary thyssenkrupp Schulte, the leading materials distributor and service provider in Germany. It was completed after around a year of construction and comprises 36,000m² of warehouse space where around 20,000 tons of materials such as steel or aluminum can be stored. This creates the greatest possible availability and performance. After a successful ramp-up, around 70 jobs will be created at the site in 3-shift operation. \"Rotenburg is our new logistics hub for Northern Germany, here we have pooled our capacities from several previous locations to serve our customers even better. The location is geographically favorable and offers space for further growth which was lacking at the previous operating sites,\" says Detlef Schotten, Chief Executive Officer of thyssenkrupp Schulte.\nImage material is available for download here (Source: thyssenkrupp Materials Services):\nhttps:\/\/transfer.thyssenkrupp.com\/public\/t117989w_fcaf8b6b307b35ee947566\/","company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2021-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","title":"New logistics center ready to start: thyssenkrupp Materials Services sets new standards for the materials business of the future","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Products and solutions","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pressdetailpage\/new-logistics-center-ready-to-start--thyssenkrupp-materials-services-sets-new-standards-for-the-materials-business-of-the-future-99164","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":8985,"text":"* Important milestone reached in focusing the portfolio and realigning the group\n  * Mining business will profit from tie-up with FLSmidth and gain attractive development prospects\n  * Closing expected within next 12 months, enterprise value is EUR 325 million\n  * Martina Merz: “The successful sale of the Mining business shows again that we are pressing on at full speed with the transformation of thyssenkrupp and achieving important results step by step. Improving performance remains our top priority.”\nthyssenkrupp today announced the sale of its Mining Technologies business unit to the Danish company FLSmidth, thus reaching a further important milestone in the initiated realignment of the group. The enterprise value is EUR 325 million. The transaction is subject to competition authority approval. The closing of the transaction is expected within the next 12 months.\nThe Mining business was allocated to the Multi Tracks segment in October 2020 in order to find a new owner. With the sale, thyssenkrupp is successfully divesting the first major portfolio company in this segment. The business unit currently employs some 3,400 people and generated sales of around EUR 0.8 bn. in fiscal year 2019\/2020. The sale is an important step in the initiated transformation of the group and the associated focusing of the portfolio. The aim is to transform thyssenkrupp into a high-performing “group of companies” with independent businesses, a lean holding company and a focus on systematic performance improvement across all businesses.\n“The successful sale of the Mining business shows that we are pressing ahead at full speed with the transformation of thyssenkrupp and achieving important results step by step. But we have not yet reached our goal. The principle ‘Performance first’ continues to apply. We need to return to positive cash flow as quickly as possible. The sale of Mining Technologies makes an important contribution to this,” said Martina Merz, CEO of thyssenkrupp AG. “At the same time I am pleased that we have found a very good new owner in FLSmidth. FLSmidth presented a convincing business strategy and a clear vision for the Mining business. It will give our employees attractive prospects. That was extremely important to us when negotiating the sale,” said Merz.\nMining business will profit from new ownership structure and attractive development prospects\nThe tie-up with FLSmidth, a listed company from Denmark and one of the world’s leading suppliers of technologies for the mining and cement industries, will create a strong player with a global presence and leading solutions along the entire mining business value chain. A particular focus is on green technologies that can significantly reduce resource consumption and emissions in the mining industry. FLSmidth also has great expertise in taking over companies and has proven highly successful in integrating these companies.\n“Thomas Schulz, CEO of FLSmidth, said: “thyssenkrupp’s Mining business is an ideal addition for FLSmidth. We are particularly impressed by the capabilities, expertise and reputation of the thyssenkrupp employees, especially in projects and products. The large global installed base offers great potential for the service and aftermarket business. We have similar business models, share a strong focus on sustainability and digitalization and our corporate cultures are a good match. As a result, I am very much looking forward to combining our strengths; I am convinced that together we will play a leading role in shaping a zero emission future for the mining industry and in creating sustainable growth for our customers, employees and shareholders.”\nProgress in transformation to a high-performing “group of companies”\nProgress is also being made with other portfolio companies in the Multi Tracks segment: thyssenkrupp is in discussions with several potential buyers for the stainless steel plant in Terni\/Italy (AST) including the associated distribution organization. In the case of Infrastructure, the sales process is at an advanced stage. \nA sale of companies or operations has not been possible in all cases: Multi Tracks has therefore decided to wind down the Heavy Plate and Carbon Components units.","company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"thyssenkrupp sells Mining business to FLSmidth and presses on with transformation of the group","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Capital market-relevant press releases","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pressdetailpage\/thyssenkrupp-sells-mining-business-to-flsmidth-and-presses-on-with-transformation-of-the-group-118875","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["negative"]}
{"id":8991,"text":"E.ON, Evonik, RWE, thyssenkrupp and Vonovia have joined forces with the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion, the RWI – Leibniz Institute for Economic Research and the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach-Foundation to accelerate the green transformation on the Rhine and Ruhr. A cross-sectoral future plan for a model hydrogen region is to be developed in a joint project. The aim is to connect pioneering solutions from industry, the energy sector, mobility and housing in order to make the Ruhr a pioneering region for a successful energy transformation.\nOur aim: The Ruhr region is to become the industrial, residential and living area with CO2-free hydrogen in Germany and thus set standards for a hydrogen economy in industrial conurbations. The project is intended to lay the groundwork for the necessary planning for infrastructure and production.\nOur task: The transformation of one of Germany's largest industrial core regions such as the Ruhr, home to 6.2 percent of the country's population, is a considerable challenge. It requires determining the cross-sectoral hydrogen demand, measuring the expansion of renewable energies or alternative hydrogen imports required for this purpose, and identifying the necessary transport infrastructure. The data collected will be used to create a roadmap that can be used to optimally align coordinated infrastructure investments with private sector investment cycles. Such a roadmap is a prerequisite for creating planning security for all parties involved and for making the region an attractive investment location. No other German region has a better starting position to solve this task: With unique connections across all sectors, synergies in generation, storage, distribution and consumption can be leveraged in the Ruhr region. The conditions for developing a comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure are ideal.\nOur aspiration: We want the Ruhr region to become a leading model hydrogen region – with a holistic, cross-sectoral development plan for hydrogen production and infrastructure. The project aims to map out the transformation in concrete terms and launch pilot projects that will provide at least 50 percent of the hydrogen required in the region with low greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. As a result, the project is expected to contribute significantly and rapidly to the reduction of CO2 emissions in the Ruhr region, while maintaining it as an efficient industrial region.\nOur partners: Integrated planning that can make the Ruhr a pioneer of the hydrogen economy needs scientific expertise and committed companies with the will to shape and transform. However, it also needs political support from the federal and state governments in order to lay the foundations for an accelerated green transformation of the Ruhr region as a unique ecosystem\/network.\nProf. Dr. Dr. h. c. Ursula Gather, Chairwoman of the Board of Trustees of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach-Foundation: \"The green transformation can only succeed at scale through innovation across value chains. This is because the scale of the challenges is too great to solve alone. New innovation ecosystems are needed to help achieve a breakthrough in the energy transformation and climate neutrality. However, such an ecosystem can only be successful if players from different areas of society, such as industry and research, work together in a well-moderated manner. In this respect, the Ruhr region is best placed for shaping the green transformation successfully and to drive forward the energy transformation for Germany.\"\nLeo Birnbaum, Chairman of the Board of Management of E.ON S.E.: \"By 2030, we as a company aim to reduce our CO2 emissions by 65 percent. We have 9 years or just over 100 months to fundamentally change our energy system and build up locally generated and green energy. For E.ON, this means building up the electricity and hydrogen infrastructure at record speed and developing efficient systems to combine the electricity, hydrogen and heat sectors intelligently. The future of our economy, our prosperity and the preservation of the environment will depend on its success.\"\nChristian Kullmann, Chairman of the Executive Board of Evonik Industries AG: \"Green hydrogen will continue to be in short supply for years to come. We must therefore set priorities and use it where we can achieve the greatest climate protection effect. So far, everyone is just optimizing their own area of activity. With cross-sectoral cooperation, we will create synergies and reduce the overall demand for green electricity and green energy sources. An efficient allocation of resources can only be achieved by working together.\"\nProf. Dr. Robert Schlögl, founding Director at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion: \"A key challenge for climate neutrality in industry is the rapid conversion of established fossil value chains to new resources and energy sources such as hydrogen and renewables. However, this progress is fundamentally determined by the limited access to these resources. Overarching coordination will greatly accelerate the overall transformation to green products, make it more plannable for everyone, and most importantly, efficient.\"\nMarkus Krebber, CEO of RWE AG: \"There is no alternative to green power and hydrogen for the decarbonization of many industries. We in the Ruhr region are best placed to become pioneers: Strong companies, well trained and motivated employees and now also a strong partnership. RWE is contributing its entire expertise in this area. If we work together to keep the pace up, we can make the region a winner.\"\nProf. Dr. Dr. h. c. Christoph M. Schmidt, President of RWI – Leibniz Institute for Economic Research: \"The Ruhr region is particularly suitable as a model region because all the sectors relevant to the green transformation are present here, close together and in many cases operate with one another. For a successful transformation, it is not enough for each individual to optimize their processes. Rather, the transformation must be thought out systemically and designed in a coordinated manner. Scientific expertise can contribute to this.\"\nMartina Merz, Chair of the Executive Board of thyssenkrupp AG: \"The Ruhr region occupies a prominent position in the green transformation. The unique linking of different sectors and industries makes it possible to think and shape all facets of the energy transformation along the entire hydrogen value chain. It is important to understand CO2-free produced hydrogen as a commodity and to think the transformation through from the end. That is the only way we will be able to develop a suitable infrastructure quickly enough.\"\nRolf Buch, CEO of Vonovia SE: \"The next German government will have the topics of climate protection, hydrogen and renewable energy high on its list of priorities, because the energy transformation can only be successfully shaped with a mix of different energy systems and technologies. Hydrogen will play an important role in this. A major challenge for all those involved lies in the economic and socially compatible integration of hydrogen,\" explained Rolf Buch, CEO of Vonovia SE. In this context Buch, who is currently also the moderator of the Initiativkreis Ruhr (Ruhr Initiative Group), underlined the innovative strength of the Ruhr region as a business location. \"With the hydrogen initiative, we are making an offer to society and government for an accelerated introduction and use of hydrogen. This strong and proud region could become a pioneer in the decarbonization of industry and thus make a decisive contribution to climate protection. The fact that different sectors and industries are linked together is unique and makes a holistic energy transformation possible.

In steelmaking, lime products are used to remove undesirable elements from the hot metal and promote the formation of slag. thyssenkrupp Steel is now starting to source desulphurizing mixtures for the steel mill from Lhoist’s new product line LEVEL|BLUE®, thus reducing CO2 emissions along the supply chain. “We are right in the middle of the transformation to climate-neutral steel production”, explains Dr. Jens Geimer, Head of Procurement & Supply Management at thyssenkrupp Steel.\n“Our approach here is comprehensive: Aside from decarbonizing our own units, we also want to make our supply chains gradually climate-neutral by 2050. To this end, we are closely working with our suppliers. We are pleased that we have found Lhoist as a partner in the lime sector to support us in achieving this goal”.\nOn the right track with climate-neutral lime\nAlexia Spieler, Head of Sales at Lhoist Germany, explains: “Together with our customers, we have set ourselves the goal of a CO2-neutral industry. Customers are increasingly looking for sustainable products. However, the manufacture of green products requires that the supply chain is also CO2-free“. The company is therefore continuously investing in research & development and is working at full stretch on technical solutions. “We are already reducing the carbon footprint of our product range with LEVEL|BLUE®“. Large part of CO2 emissions are avoided or reduced. Complete compensation of the other CO2 emissions arising from the production and transport of our products is achieved by investing in worldwide climate protection projects. The product is certified according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG). thyssenkrupp Steel is thus provided with a climate-neutral raw material, thereby improving its own carbon footprint.\nJoint commitment to a climate-neutral industry\nThe two companies have been systematically forging ahead with CO2 reduction projects for many years now. thyssenkrupp Steel has set itself the goal to become climate-neutral by 2050. CO2 emissions from the company's own production processes and purchased energy are to be reduced by 30 percent by as early as 2030. The reduction goal for the so-called Scope-3 emissions in the upstream and downstream value chains is 16 percent. Moreover, thyssenkrupp Steel and Lhoist are involved in the IN4climate.NRW research network.

{"id":8996,"text":"* A new modular heating system to achieve a 13% decrease in gas consumption for the first year alone, reducing CO2 emissions by 2,500 tons\n  * Various activities are expected to lead to an annual reduction of about three million kW\/h of electricity upon completion\n  * All measures are part of a three-year lean manufacturing roadmap\nBerco, a global leader in the production and supply of undercarriages and components for the world's leading manufacturers of heavy machinery and for the Aftermarket, is aiming to reduce the environmental impact of its production. This has resulted in the initiation of an optimization of its Copparo plant, to meet the environmentally sustainable standards of the coming years.\nThe implementation of this renovation will be carried out over a three-year roadmap to reduce CO2 emissions by 2,500 tons per year as well as the annual consumption of gas by 13%. Various activities in the field of energy efficiency are estimated to lead to an annual reduction of about three million kW\/h of electricity when the project is completed.\nRespective investments have already been implemented or will be planned along the course of the roadmap. \"This project\", comments Andrea Marigo, Head of Integrated Management System Industry Europe at Berco, \"started with an in-depth analysis of the consumption of electricity, water and gas. It is closely connected to our lean manufacturing path which was started three years ago at the Copparo plant and focused on production efficiency, eliminating waste and bringing value to the market.\"\nEquipment with a better energy efficiency and a new modular heating system\nThe first step concentrated on reducing the energy consumption of all the machinery present in the Copparo production lines. To this end, the real use of each machine was analyzed in terms of relative performance. The obsolete, very energy-intensive ones were thus dismantled and, when necessary, replaced with new equipment that have a lower impact on consumption.\nA new modular heating system will be activated in the coming winter months. A 13% reduction in gas consumption for the first year of operation is estimated, with a consequent reduction of as much as 2,500 tons of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. To reduce the consumption of natural gas both for production use and for heating (heating uses both gas and electricity) of the entire Copparo complex, Berco opted to replace the only 20 MW thermal power plant with a series of modern and delocalized thermal energy sources.\nDecentralization of compressed air and electric power to bring energy savings\nThe production and distribution of compressed air, widely used in various production phases within Copparo, has always represented a particularly energy-intensive process in terms of kW\/h. Also in this case, the watchword is decentralization: the massive system with centralized compressors is being replaced by compressors located in the various production areas. Annual savings of around 2.5% compared to the average consumption of the last three years are estimated.\nFurthermore, the decentralized distribution of electrical power will guarantee a better use of energy, with the new system catering to the specific needs of each individual department. The possible use of photovoltaic panels is equally under evaluation. The various activities relating to the production and distribution of compressed air, the modification of the cooling circuits as well as the reorganization of the electrical distribution, are estimated to lead to an annual reduction of about three million kW\/h of electricity when the project is completed.\nLower amount of water required and non-separate waste\nThe current water consumption of the Copparo plant is about 300,000 m3 per year. Taken directly from the Po River, this water is mainly intended for the cooling circuits of the plants. Currently, the cooling circuits are closed and built with evaporative towers, which cool the water by exchanging heat with the surrounding air, before putting it back into circulation.\nThese circuits, however, will be the subject of future analyses and some studies are already at an advanced stage to evaluate important actions to realize decentralized plants in the near future. This would not only be less energy-intensive, but it would also potentially result in the reduction of the dispersion of water through evaporation - therefore less water would be required to be integrated into the system - thanks to new tower configurations.\nIn addition to lowering its energy consumption, Berco has also in recent years focused on ensuring the greatest possible recovery of steel. This goal has been achieved thanks to a careful management of the production process, that distinguishes and separates production waste in the best possible way, avoiding the transfer of non-separated waste.\nThese are the first strong structural changes that Berco already has in store for the next three years and are in line with the important objectives that the Group has set to reduce its carbon footprint. \"In addition to these implementations\", concludes Marigo, \"the completion of the lean transformation of Copparo production, with the consequent strong reduction in the handling of goods within the plant, as well as waste in the treatment of materials, will bring further environmental benefits.\"\nAbout Berco:\nBerco is a global leading manufacturer and supplier of undercarriages for heavy machinery.

{"id":8997,"text":"* Increases blast furnace efficiency and reduces costs\n  * Reduces CO2 emissions\n  * Offers a rapid return on investment\n  * Exclusive, worldwide cooperation agreement\nPrimetals Technologies and thyssenkrupp have signed an exclusive, worldwide cooperation agreement which sees both parties commit to bringing the innovative Sequence Impulse Process (known as SIP for short) technology to the market. The SIP technology has been developed by thyssenkrupp AT.Pro tec, a company of thyssenkrupp Materials Services, and is well established for use in foundry cupola furnaces. The underlying principles of this proven technology have been adapted and specifically tailored to the blast furnace process. To prove the technology, thyssenkrupp Steel Europe has installed the first ever full system on their blast furnace #1 at Schwelgern, Duisburg in Germany.\nBlast furnace operators can conventionally lower operating costs through injection of alternative fuels with the hot air blast (most commonly pulverized coal) in order to reduce the required coke rate in the burden. Additional oxygen enrichment is required to promote combustion for the added fuel. Whilst benefiting the economic aspects for the furnace, this also results in a number of process and operational challenges. Combustion of the fuel localized in the raceway entry leads to higher heat loads on the shell and un-combusted material (char) can accumulate in the burden. This impedes gas flow and drainage, ultimately reducing the furnace performance efficiency.\nThe patented SIP technology acts to repurpose the enrichment oxygen, and deliver a series of controlled, high-energy pulses, increasing local concentration in the raceway. The resulting action is improved combustion and conversion of fuel, leading to better gas distribution and drainage potential. Additionally, through higher penetration of the oxygen, the heat load generated is moved more to the central zone of the furnace. The small coke proportion in the burden can be increased without loss of permeability or increased overall pressure drop. These conditions permit an increase in the replacement of coke with injectant and higher production potential whist avoiding deterioration of the process conditions.\nTotal fuel rate can be lowered and, as a result, the added benefit of reduced carbon dioxide emission is achieved. The SIP technology therefore brings multiple advantages in terms of significant savings in overall operating costs and supports the blast furnace operators in their moves towards carbon neutrality.\n“The cooperation makes a lot of sense for Primetals Technologies because our plant building competence and blast furnace process knowledge are complemented by thyssenkrupp’s vast operating expertise, particularly on large units. We’ve been engaged for some time now in supporting our customers in developing their roadmaps to carbon neutrality. We know that new technologies will eventually replace the blast furnace, but these will take a long time to mature. Currently process improvements which reduce costs and improve the green credentials are critically important to steelmakers globally. This technical development is not only time relevant, but the strength of each partner also makes this a great fit to meet customer expectations.” says Paul Freeman, Director of the Blast Furnace Business for Primetals Technologies UK.\nJörg Glebe, Managing Director of thyssenkrupp AT.PRO tec GmbH says \"By optimizing the consumption of the reducing agents coke and coal, we have a major lever for efficiency improvements, cost and CO2 savings. Following the premiere at thyssenkrupp Steel Europe last year, we are delighted that in Primetals Technology we have now gained a partner for bringing our technology to the market.”\nA press photo (Copyright: thyssenkrupp AG) is available at: https:\/\/transfer.thyssenkrupp.com\/public\/c123529y_5f4ef518ef1a6b3b13d1a1\/","company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2021-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Primetals Technologies and thyssenkrupp join forces to launch an innovative blast furnace technology enabling a key step towards carbon neutrality","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Products and solutions","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pressdetailpage\/primetals-technologies-and-thyssenkrupp-join-forces-to-launch-an-innovative-blast-furnace-technology-enabling-a-key-step-towards-carbon-neutrality-121322","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["unsure"]}
{"id":8998,"text":"* Up to 70 per cent lower allocated CO2 intensity with newly introduced bluemint® Steel\n  * Allocation approach for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions per tonne of bluemint® pure steel at the Duisburg site with independent assurance by the international certification body DNV\n  * Separate certificate from TÜV Süd validates scrap recycling via blast furnace allowing for a considerable reduction in carbon dioxide emissions\n  * Premium bathroom solution provider Kaldewei as first bluemint® pure client\nDuisburg, October 6th. thyssenkrupp Steel has successfully attained a significant milestone along the green transformation path towards climate-neutral steel. Today, the first batches were delivered under the new brand name bluemint® Steel. The first customer to be supplied with flat steel products of the bluemint® family is the Ahlen-based premium bathroom builder Kaldewei. The approach to reducing the CO2 emissions at the blast furnace, which has been independently assured by the international certification body DNV, allows for the allocation of the carbon emission savings to a specific quantity of the product bluemint® pure. The carbon emission intensity per tonne of steel produced is thus reduced by 70 per cent. The benefits that can be achieved using this approach were also confirmed by Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy – thyssenkrupp Steel's advisor to the project.\nCalculation method for emission control in alignment with international standards\nbluemint® pure has all direct emissions from its production at the Duisburg site neutralized by savings in the production process– the emissions of the so-called upstream chain (Scope 3) are retained. These include all emissions that occur during the production and transportation of the raw materials. In this way, the emission intensity per tonne is reduced by 1.5 tonnes to 0.6 tonnes of CO2 per tonne product, which corresponds to an overall reduction of 70 per cent. This positive effect is achieved through the use of already reduced iron (HBI). This allows for less coal consumption in the reduction process at the blast furnace. This achieves a verifiable reduction of emissions. Priti Hoffmann, Sustainability lead, Benelux at DNV: “DNV reviewed the methodology developed by thyssenkrupp Steel and the data from an initial trial period of HBI use in a blast furnace at their Duisburg plant. I am pleased that DNV Business Assurance has played an essential role for thyssenkrupp Steel in this landmark launch of bluemint® pure steel products. bluemint® pure steel certificates, for steel products with a reduced CO2 intensity, are based on CO2 savings in the steel production process which are achieved by changing input materials in the blast furnace. These savings are then allocated to a quantity of steel products, according to a methodology, which has been assured by DNV. The methodology for calculating product-related CO2 savings is in accordance with the internationally recognised Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard.”\nThe fact that carbon savings allocation approaches can support the decarbonisation of the steel sector is acknowledged by the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy. Prof. Dr. Stefan Lechtenböhmer points out: \"We have examined various options with thyssenkrupp Steel 2020 as to how CO2 savings can already be achieved in the short term within the framework of conventional blast furnace technology. The way to distribute the CO2 reductions achieved in real terms via a balance-sheet approach calculated on the product is feasible and makes sense. What is important here is that these are additional climate protection measures and that they are part of a comprehensive decarbonisation strategy for steel production.”\nMarketing launch for steel with an allocated low CO2 intensity\nThe launch of the bluemint® product family also marks the start of active marketing measures for products with an allocated low CO2 intensity. Bernhard Osburg, CEO of thyssenkrupp Steel, explains: ”It is important that we can provide our customers with products that contribute to real and measurable carbon dioxide reduction as quickly as can be. This is where we start. We are very happy to be supplying our products to Kaldewei, a company that is particularly committed to the idea of sustainability. We will now gradually expand the commercialization of our CO2-reduced bluemint® Steel range and have already commenced negotiations with a number of additional customers.”\nFranz Kaldewei: “bluemint® pure offers us the certainty of already being able to use the highest quality steel at a low carbon intensity for the production of our steel enamel bathroom solutions. This is an important step towards achieving our climate targets. With bluemint®steel from thyssenkrupp, we are clearing a major hurdle on the way to Kaldewei’s climate-neutral orientation.”\nTÜV Süd approves use of scrap in blast furnaces\nA second, separate approach towards a CO2-reduced steel production has been taken by thyssenkrupp Steel by obtaining certification from TÜV Süd in accordance with the VERIsteel procedure. This involves the use of scrap in the blast furnace process. This technological change will once again result in an absolute reduction of CO2 emissions at the Duisburg site. This is also achieved through a reduced coal consumption, since correspondingly less coal is needed for melting the scrap in the blast furnace. For each tonne of recycled product, a reduction in emission intensity from 2.1 tonnes to 0.75 tonnes of CO2 is achieved and accounted for on the balance sheet.\nSystematic implementation of the transformation strategy\nThe bluemint pure steel now being delivered are part of the comprehensive transformation strategy at thyssenkrupp Steel. The crucial milestone in the transformation of Europe’s largest integrated steel mill towards climate neutrality will be the replacement of the conventional blast furnaces with hydrogen-fuelled direct reduction plants. The commissioning of the first large-scale plant including a melter is planned for 2025.\nIn the run-up to this technological leap, all possibilities are being exploited to noticeably reduce the CO2 emissions during production already with the existing blast-furnace-based technology. The use of HBI or scrap as carbon-reducing feedstock is the first step. In the future, thyssenkrupp Steel will also expand the use of hydrogen in the blast furnace and thus further increase the production of environmentally friendly steel. The world’s first trials on the use of hydrogen started in Duisburg back in 2019 and have meanwhile been successfully accomplished. Christoph Dammermann, State Secretary at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Innovation, Digitalization and Energy, points out: “The Ruhr is predestined to become a model region for decarbonization. thyssenkrupp is sending a clear signal here with the first CO2-reduced steel produced in Duisburg.
