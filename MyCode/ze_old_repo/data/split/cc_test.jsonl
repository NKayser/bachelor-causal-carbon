{"id":94,"text":"* Carbon capture portfolio now exceeds 20 projects across the US, Canada and Europe. * Latest project addition in Spain, where CO2 will increase farm efficiency. * Partner in three-year project funded by the European Union. LafargeHolcim’s portfolio of carbon capture projects was recently reinforced as the United States Department of Energy’s National Energy Laboratory Technology (DOE-NETL) announced that it will support the LH CO2MENT Colorado Project. This follows funding by the German government of the Westküste 100 project, which was announced in August. LafargeHolcim and consortium partners Svante Inc, Oxy Low Carbon Ventures LLC (OLCV) and Total have completed a study to assess the viability and design of a commercial-scale carbon-capture facility. With the confirmation of DOE-NETL funding, the partnership has committed to the next project phase to evaluate the feasibility of the facility designed to capture up to two million tons of CO2 per year directly from the Holcim cement plant and the natural gas-fired steam generator, which would be sequestered underground permanently by Occidental. The Westküste 100 project in Germany also received the go-ahead and funding approval from the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy in August. In this project, CO2 from the LafargeHolcim Lägerdorf plant will be transformed with green hydrogen into a synthetic fuel. The potential carbon capture capacity for the cement plant is approximately one million tons of CO2 per year. Westküste 100 (www.westkueste 100.de) is a ten-company consortium focused on the creation of low-carbon solutions and end-to-end sustainable business practices across industries. LafargeHolcim recently added to its portfolio of CCUS pilots with the ECCO2-LH project in Spain, in collaboration with Carbon Clean and Sistemas de Calor, which will capture CO2 from flue gas at its Carboneras plant and turn it to agricultural use for accelerated crop production. This will increase farm efficiency by reducing water and soil consumption ratio per kg of vegetable production. Starting with 10 of CO2 emissions from 2022, the commercial applicability of this viable CO2 circular economy business model can potentially leverage 700,000 tons of CO2 and achieve 100 decarbonization at the plant. Chief Sustainability Officer, Magali Anderson: \"Carbon capture, usage and storage will most likely play a key role in many industries' decarbonization journey. That’s why we are multiplying our pilots to test various scenarios with the ambition of reaching effective, affordable and scalable solutions. It is very encouraging to receive the support of funders such as the US and German governments, as partnering with like-minded organizations is key to scale up our impact.\" LafargeHolcim is expanding its CCUS portfolio with more than twenty projects across the US, Canada and Europe. Overall these ongoing CCUS projects could save approximately four million tons of CO2 per year. This expanding range of projects is designed to give the company maximum flexibility in applying CCUS technologies. The best solutions in terms of technology and cost efficiency could be replicated in other plants in selected regions, advancing the company’s CO2 reduction journey and adding value in the form of CO2-related materials, thereby creating new growth opportunities for the company. Working with other multinationals as well as start-ups, CCUS pilots are evaluated in terms of cost, technical feasibility, compatibility with CO2 usage opportunities and other aspects of viability and scalability. With the coordination of the LafargeHolcim Innovation Center in Lyon, the company also participates in a three-year project funded by the European Union to support the development of low-carbon energy and industry in Southern and Eastern Europe1. The company’s objective is to work from a long menu of carbon capture, usage and storage solutions, combining them in different ways and environments to assess their potential.

{"id":99,"text":"The new RWE: carbon neutral by 2040 and one of the world´s leading renewable energy companies  ### Essen, 30. September 2019    * Ambitious CO2 reduction plan: resolute and responsible phasing out of fossil fuels – massive investments in wind and solar energy as well as high-performance storage technologies   * Outstanding starting position in renewables to be build upon with a net investment of 1.5 billion euros per annum    Rolf Martin Schmitz, former Chief Executive Officer at RWE AG  \"Today, Brussels paved the way for the “new RWE”. This makes us one of the world’s leading renewable energy companies. We intend annual net investments of 1.5 billion euros to consolidate and further strengthen this position. Now we are putting all our energy into tackling this task.\"  Dr. Rolf Martin Schmitz, CEO of RWE AG  Carbon neutral by 2040, one of the world´s leading renewable energy companies, a responsible producer of power from all energy sources – this is the formula behind the new RWE. Based on a three-stage CO2 reduction plan, the company has set itself ambitious goals for its strategic realignment. RWE intends to become a carbon neutral company within the next 20 years.   RWE decreased its carbon dioxide emissions by one-third from 2012 to 2018, representing a decline of 60 million metric tons. An additional reduction of approximately 70 percent is envisaged by 2030. RWE will decommission its last coal-fired power station in the United Kingdom to this end. In Germany, more of the Group’s coal power plants will gradually be taken offline, following the recommendations of the Commission for Structural Change. The Dutch government wants its country’s coal-based electricity generation to end by 2030. RWE is in the process of converting the plants in Eemshaven and Amer to fire biomass. The objective is to transform electricity generation from fossil fuel in order to achieve carbon neutral production. In addition to a large international portfolio including wind turbines and photovoltaic units which the company intends to expand continuously, RWE will then place its chips on storage, biomass and gas-fired power stations primarily fired by ‘green’ gas, which will be indispensable to achieving security of supply. “This presents RWE with a huge task. But we have a very clear idea of how to achieve our goal: We will phase out fossil energy sources both consistently and responsibly. We will make huge investments in wind and solar power as well as in high-capacity storage technologies. The new RWE is and will remain one of the major players in the electricity generation business,” declares Rolf Martin Schmitz, CEO of RWE AG.  Growing renewable energy is the clear focus of the new RWE. The renewable energy portfolios of E.ON and innogy, combined to form RWE Renewables, will turn the company into a “global player made in Germany” with an installed capacity of more than 9 gigawatts. Added to this are further assets with a combined capacity of 2.6 gigawatts under construction that will be completed in the near future. The world’s No. 2 in offshore wind and Europe’s No. 3 in renewable energy – these are the starting positions that the company intends to consolidate and strengthen. RWE will provide an annual 1.5 billion euros in net capital expenditure for both offshore and onshore wind turbines as well as photovoltaics and storage. Project partnerships have the potential to increase total investment to between 2 and 3 billion euros per annum.  Diversification via technologies and regions as well as scale and financial strength are the key success factors in the renewables business. Diversification, in order to minimise interdependencies resulting from changing regulatory and political framework conditions. Scale, in order to put technological progress into practice and reduce electricity generation costs. Financial strength, in order to spur growth. These are the decisive factors RWE where to develop renewables projects around the globe.  RWE’s transformation is reflected in its earnings as well. Going forward, only 20 percent of EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) will come from the conventional business. Three times as much, i.e. about 60 percent, will be earned from business with renewable energies, while energy trading will be contributing 10 percent. The remaining 10 percent will come from financial investments, including Amprion, Kelag and E.ON. “In the last few years, we have worked hard to give RWE a robust financial setup and make the company fit for the future. Today, our operations are profitable, our processes are efficient, and we offer our shareholders an attractive dividend. We have the financial, strategic and personnel power required to run renewable energy operations all over the world. This is an outstanding basis from which to seize the opportunities of the future,” underlines CFO Markus Krebber.   The tasks are distributed clearly. In addition to a lean holding company, the new RWE and its 20,000 employees worldwide will consist of four operating companies: RWE Renewables, RWE Supply & Trading, RWE Generation and RWE Power.  “Lignite and nuclear energy have laid the foundations we are building the new RWE on. Past, current and future employees working in conventional areas have our utmost respect. But every form of energy has its time. Now we are opening a new chapter of our corporate history, which looks back on over 120 years. With great enthusiasm for the new world, without forgetting where we came from. Openness, fairness and respect for each other’s work will characterise the new RWE as well,” says Rolf Martin Schmitz.   ### Downloads    * Press Release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2019-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"The new RWE: carbon neutral by 2040 and one of the world´s leading renewable energy companies","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2019-09-30-the-new-rwe","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"pdf_url not found.

The cluster brings together industrial partners to help investigate and unlock the potential options for decarbonising the region’s industrial processes. As one of the world’s renewable energy leaders and with an in-depth knowledge of hydrogen, we believe it is a perfect fit for RWE.”   ####  Tom Glover, Chief Commercial Officer RWE Renewables and RWE UK Country Chair   RWE, Wales’ largest energy generator, is set to launch a number of feasibility studies into the reduction of carbon emissions at its key assets in South Wales, thanks to a successful funding bid as part of the South Wales Industrial Cluster (SWIC). The cluster funding has been announced today and comes from Innovate UK and the UK Government’s Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Industrial Decarbonisation Fund.   In addition to the UK, RWE is involved in hydrogen and carbon reduction projects in Germany and the Netherlands across all areas of the value chain, making the company a perfect partner for the SWIC consortium. The new studies will investigate how hydrogen and carbon capture can help reduce carbon emissions from RWE’s 2.2 gigawatts (GW) gas-fired Pembroke Power Station. They will also look into the feasibility of establishing a new green hydrogen production facility to support the SWIC partners within the industrial cluster.  Tom Glover said: “Pembroke is the most modern and efficient gas power plant in the UK and will play a vital role in supporting the energy transition over the coming years. It is important to understand the potential of hydrogen and carbon capture opportunities to ensure cleaner energy and industry in the coming years, as well as helping to secure skilled jobs for the region.”   Sopna Sury, Chief Operating Officer RWE Generation added: “We believe that hydrogen is a real game changer in the transition to a low carbon economy. Therefore, RWE will contribute its broad expertise in hydrogen, renewables and as the UK’s second largest generator of electricity, to support the success of these three feasibility projects.”  SWIC is a consortium of Wales’ major industry, energy, infrastructure, law, academic and engineering organisations and RWE is a key member. The cluster has been successful in securing support from the public and private sector, to develop a range of partner projects including; the production and use of a hydrogen supply, carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) and CO2 shipping from South Wales which would be the first CO2 shipping industry in the whole of the UK. Together these projects can decarbonise industry and power in South Wales and create a net zero emissions industrial zone by 2040.  In 2020 the UK government announced a 10 Point Plan to deliver a Green Industrial Revolution to mobilise £12 billion of Government investment and create 250,000 jobs in the green economy, £1 billion of which was pledged to create carbon capture clusters.  Dr Chris Williams, who is heading up SWIC for Industry Wales, said: “The UK Government has set in law that the UK needs to be Net Zero by 2050, the South Wales Industrial Cluster has ambitions to do this by 2040. The collaboration and support of all partners has been pivotal to SWIC’s achievements so far.“  The deployment phase will help unlock the route to Net Zero in South Wales, helping support the future of existing industries, businesses and jobs. Once developed, the net zero infrastructure will attract new industries and businesses, further developing the production and use of hydrogen for home heating, power generation and transport across the region.  RWE has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the development of hydrogen projects across Europe including involvement in GET H2 , NortH2 and AquaVentus. The company will utilise the experience from its newly developed hydrogen team to support this activity within the cluster.  RWE is involved in all stages of the hydrogen value chain, ranging from electricity generation from renewables to hydrogen generation and storage, through to distribution to industrial customers. Through its gas-fired power stations, such as Pembroke Power Station in Wales, in the long-term the company is positioned to be an off-taker of low-carbon hydrogen for firm, flexible power. It will also support RWE’s target to be carbon neutral by 2040.

{"id":101,"text":"RWE delivers LNG cargo on a carbon-neutral basis to Korean steel company POSCO     * RWE is now ready to offer carbon-neutral LNG to all of its customers    ### Essen \/ Singapore, 29 March 2021  Through close co-operation RWE has arranged the delivery of a carbon offset cargo for its customer POSCO end of March. The Korean POSCO Group is one of the world's leading steel producers. The cargo was delivered to the Gwangyang Terminal, South Korea. Under the agreement between RWE and POSCO, carbon emissions associated with the LNG cargo from wellhead to delivery, including exploration, production and transport, have been offset. This is achieved through the retirement of a corresponding amount of carbon credits, so called Verified Emissions Reductions (VER) certificates. High quality carbon credits have been sourced and independently certified under the internationally recognised Gold Standard, which adheres to strict environmental and social principles, and will be retired in order to compensate for the associated CO2 emissions of producing and delivering the cargo to Korea. The carbon emission intensity of the cargo delivery was estimated using the Wood Mackenzie LNG Emissions Tool. RWE is now able to provide all its customers with the opportunity to offset carbon emissions related to LNG deliveries through the use of emission reduction certificates.  Ji-Won Suh, Senior Vice President at POSCO, says: “We acknowledge that tackling climate change is not a matter for the future but rather a pressing issue that requires immediate action to create a better world. As one of the biggest steelmakers, we aspire to fulfil our responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint. Therefore, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to RWE for supplying our first carbon-neutral LNG which represents much to our business based on our strong partnership. We will also seek opportunities to collaborate with all our stakeholders to build a net-zero society worldwide.”  Javier Moret, Global Head of LNG at RWE Supply & Trading, is also convinced: “We believe offsetting of emissions can play an important role in fighting climate change during the transition to a carbon-free economy. Therefore, we are very pleased to have partnered together with our customer POSCO to deliver to them an LNG cargo with carbon offsets for their domestic market. Furthermore, we are delighted to be able to provide our customers with solutions for reducing their carbon intensity on a more regular basis in the future.”  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE delivers LNG cargo on a carbon-neutral basis to Korean steel company POSCO ","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Supply & Trading GmbH","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-supply-and-trading\/2021-03-29-rwe-delivers-lng-cargo-on-a-carbon-neutral-basis-to-korean-steel-company-posco","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-supply-and-trading\/2021\/2021-03-29-rwe-delivers-lng-cargo-on-a-carbon-neutral-basis-to-korean-steel-company-posco.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":631,"from_id":754,"to_id":755,"type":"causality"},{"id":632,"from_id":756,"to_id":757,"type":"causality"}],"entities":[{"id":754,"label":"cause","start_offset":968,"end_offset":983},{"id":755,"label":"effect","start_offset":996,"end_offset":1039},{"id":756,"label":"cause","start_offset":2059,"end_offset":2194},{"id":757,"label":"effect","start_offset":2207,"end_offset":2355}]}

As one of the world’s leading energy companies, RWE has significant expertise in onshore and offshore wind, developing green hydrogen production plants and operating large-scale gas plants. Pembroke is a unique site to establish a Net Zero Centre, which will showcase in one location the technologies that are essential to Wales’s decarbonised future.”  ####  Tom Glover, RWE UK Country Chair   RWE, one of the world’s leading energy companies, today launches the Pembroke Net Zero Centre (PNZC) as a major initiative towards decarbonisation. With Pembroke Power Station located at its heart, the PNZC will draw on the extensive knowledge and expertise from across RWE’s offshore wind, gas-fired generation and hydrogen businesses to demonstrate a pathway towards decarbonisation.  RWE is already Wales’ largest power generator from both gas and renewables, with 12 sites that include onshore and offshore wind and hydro. The PNZC will work with hundreds of RWE experts across the Welsh, UK and international businesses in generation, renewables and trading, looking at the deployment of state-of-the-art technologies to help decarbonise the region and support Wales’ Roadmap to Net Zero’ by 2050.  PNZC is made up of three distinct pillars: green hydrogen production, including feasibility studies and potential development of an electrolyser on the Pembroke site, the development of floating offshore wind in the Celtic Sea and decarbonisation of Pembroke Power Station, including studies for carbon capture and the feasibility of hydrogen as a fuel.  Pembroke is the ideal location for the Net Zero Centre: RWE operates a large-scale gas-fired power station with access to gas and electricity networks, floating wind opportunities in the Celtic Sea and potential industrial off-takers for green hydrogen in South Wales (i.e. in the South Wales Industrial Cluster, SWIC).  Tom Glover said: “Pembroke is a unique place to house a decarbonisation centre. It has all the elements to become a SuperPlace for decarbonisation: floating offshore wind accessibility, land for development of large-scale electrolysers, electricity and gas grid connections and a gas-fired power station providing firm and flexible power. RWE’s investment in decarbonisation has the potential to become the green power and gas provider to Wales, assisting other companies to meet their decarbonisation targets and helping Welsh Government achieve its ambition for Net Zero.”  Pembroke is one of the most efficient gas power plants in the UK, playing a vital role in supporting the energy transition over the coming years. It is important to investigate the potential for hydrogen combustion and carbon capture, to ensure the supply of low carbon energy to industry and secure skilled jobs for the region.  Feasibility studies that have been part-funded by the UK Government will investigate how hydrogen and carbon capture can help reduce carbon emissions from Pembroke Power Station. These studies will also look into the feasibility of establishing a new green hydrogen production facility to support the SWIC partners within the industrial cluster. SWIC is a consortium of Wales’ major industry, energy, infrastructure, law, academic and engineering organisations and RWE is a key member. The cluster brings together partner projects to decarbonise industry and power in South Wales.  RWE has nine offshore wind sites in operation, three of which are in Wales, with a capacity of 1328 MW (pro rata). Further offshore sites under construction and in development include Triton Knoll, Sofia and Awel y Môr. Floating offshore wind will play an important part in the growth of offshore renewable generation, and has the potential to unlock new markets around the world. RWE is actively investigating a number of floating wind opportunities in the UK and views the Celtic Sea opportunity as a major part of this.  RWE has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the development of hydrogen projects across Europe, including involvement in GET H2, NortH2 and AquaVentus. The company will utilise the experience from its Hydrogen Team to support this activity.  For more information about the Pembroke Net Zero Centre visit: www.rwe.com\/pnzc.

{"id":103,"text":"Green hydrogen and decarbonisation solutions: Shell and RWE want to drive energy transition forward    * Memorandum of Understanding signed: covers production, use and distribution of H2      * Options to be explored in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK      * Joint decarbonisation projects to be explored for RWE power plants    ### Essen\/Cologne, 10 November 2021  Shell New Energies NL BV (Shell) and RWE Generation SE (RWE) intend to jointly advance ambitious projects for the production, use and distribution of green hydrogen as well as further options to decarbonise RWE gas and biomass-fired power plants in northwest Europe. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was recently signed by Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE AG, and Wael Sawan, Director of Integrated Gas, Renewables and Energy Solutions at Royal Dutch Shell plc, at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland near Cologne. The aim of the MoU is to identify concrete project options which could then be developed toward investment decisions.  Hydrogen is crucial for the decarbonisation of industry and achieving climate neutrality in large-scale production and processing. Many companies can only achieve their climate goals through the use of hydrogen produced without CO2 emissions. Accordingly, the demand for green and blue hydrogen is increasing, and the two companies want to focus their cooperation on this potential.  RWE and Shell already have a background of positive cooperation through the pioneering projects NortH2 in the Netherlands and AquaVentus in Germany. In a next step, integrated projects for the production of green hydrogen, using offshore wind power on a gigawatt scale, will also be examined in the industrial regions in the north-east of England (such as, Teesside and\/or Humberside). RWE and Shell intend to jointly assess the future development of electrolysis plants to produce green hydrogen and consider locations which have potential pipeline capacity for hydrogen yet are currently difficult to connect to the electric grid. RWE and Shell want to investigate whether, and how, green energy can be transported from such locations to customers via hydrogen pipelines.  RWE and Shell also want to develop new green hydrogen solutions for industrial customers, focused on the Shell Energy & Chemicals Park Rheinland in Germany, Shell sites in Rotterdam and Moerdijk in the Netherlands, and on customers in their immediate vicinity.  In addition, RWE and Shell intend to evaluate the possible application of green hydrogen in the mobility sector in Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK. A starting point for this could be, for example, the hydrogen station network for heavy trucks which Shell plans to build between Rotterdam, Cologne and Hamburg by 2024.  In the MoU, the two companies also agreed to examine technical alternatives for the decarbonisation of RWE’s gas and biomass power plants, such as the possibility of capturing and storing CO2. The companies will also examine the use of blue hydrogen in RWE's gas-fired power plants in Pembroke (Wales), Emsland (Germany) and Moerdijk (the Netherlands), among others. If progressed, Shell would produce and supply the hydrogen as well as capture and store the CO2. The results of the trial could be transferred later to other RWE sites, in parallel with the developing transport infrastructure for hydrogen and CO2.  \"We are delighted about this agreement with RWE. Both companies are of the opinion that progress towards net-zero emissions needs government policy to support the energy transition and our customers' needs for low-carbon energy solutions,\" said Wael Sawan, Director of Integrated Gas, Renewables and Energy Solutions at Royal Dutch Shell plc. \"It makes sense for us to evaluate the potential of joint decarbonisation projects and make the best of the global energy experience both companies bring to the table.\"  \"Effective climate action needs cross-sector and cross-national cooperation. In our cooperation with Shell, we want to develop solutions that combine new approaches with proven technologies and, above all, can be applied quickly and on a large scale. We will also contribute our special expertise in the development of offshore wind projects as well as the provision of energy in the form of electricity, heat and, in the future, green hydrogen for our customers,\" emphasised Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Green hydrogen and decarbonisation solutions: Shell and RWE want to drive energy transition forward","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Generation SE","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-generation\/2021-11-10-shell-and-rwe-want-to-drive-energy-transition-forward","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-generation-se\/2021\/2021-11-10-shell-and-rwe-want-to-drive-energy-transition-forward.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":635,"from_id":762,"to_id":761,"type":"property"},{"id":636,"from_id":763,"to_id":761,"type":"property"},{"id":637,"from_id":764,"to_id":765,"type":"causality"}],"entities":[{"id":761,"label":"technology","start_offset":148,"end_offset":186},{"id":762,"label":"status","start_offset":105,"end_offset":132},{"id":763,"label":"location","start_offset":220,"end_offset":255},{"id":764,"label":"cause","start_offset":1142,"end_offset":1252},{"id":765,"label":"effect","start_offset":1267,"end_offset":1319},{"id":766,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":1142,"end_offset":1392}]}

The MoU envisages the supply of low-carbon ammonia and hydrogen by Novatek to RWE. Novatek, the largest independent producer of natural gas in Russia, is conducting a pre-FEED (Front End Engineering Design) study for blue ammonia and hydrogen production in the Yamal region, which will include carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities. The fuel is to be produced at Novateks’s planned Obskiy Gas Chemical Complex project and will be delivered to RWE and its customers in Germany and other European markets.  The partners also intend to extend their cooperation in supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG), including possible carbon-neutral LNG. The trend towards greater transparency on greenhouse gas emissions is supported by both companies and marks an important first step towards the potential use of carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions.  Javier Moret, Global Head of LNG at RWE Supply & Trading emphasises: “Europe has set ambitious climate targets. To achieve them, renewables must be expanded massively and quickly. At the same time, however, we need a flexible generation as a back-up to guarantee security of supply. The ultimate goal is for plants powered by green energy sources to take over this task, such as gas-fired power plants fuelled by green hydrogen. But until that point is reached, bridge solutions such as gas, LNG and blue hydrogen will be needed. We are therefore very pleased to be working with Novatek to evaluate possibilities to supply Europe with large quantities of blue and green hydrogen.\"  “We are very well positioned to benefit from the transition of global economies to low carbon energy sources,” said Lev Feodosyev, Novatek’s First Deputy Chairman of the Management Board. “Natural gas including LNG is already replacing other types of fuels with higher carbon footprint, and we are working on decreasing the already low carbon footprint of LNG produced by our projects in the Russian Arctic. Now we are undertaking the pre-FEED study for the blue ammonia and hydrogen plant with CCS facilities nearby our LNG cluster in Yamal for the delivery to final customers of low-carbon products in Europe and Asia.”  With its investment and growth strategy ‘Growing Green’ RWE wants to invest €50 billion gross through to 2030 to grow its green and flexible generation portfolio. Thanks to an installed capacity of 14 gigawatts (GW), RWE is currently operating the second-largest gas-fired power station fleet in Europe.  In the context of ‘Growing Green’, additional plants, which will have a clear decarbonisation roadmap, are planned and a roadmap for “green conversion” will be developed for all existing gas-fired power stations. RWE will also significantly expand its trading in green energy sources and its range of tailored energy solutions for large customers. RWE plans therefore to open up new business opportunities in the areas of hydrogen and ammonia importing, in order to supply industry in Europe.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE and Novatek cooperate on decarbonisation of industry","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Supply & Trading GmbH","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-supply-and-trading\/2021-12-07-rwe-and-novatek-cooperate-on-decarbonisation-of-industry","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-supply-and-trading\/2021\/2021-12-07-rwe-and-novatek-cooperate-on-decarbonisation-of-industry.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":638,"from_id":767,"to_id":776,"type":"property"},{"id":639,"from_id":768,"to_id":776,"type":"reference"},{"id":640,"from_id":773,"to_id":774,"type":"property"},{"id":641,"from_id":774,"to_id":776,"type":"reference"},{"id":642,"from_id":772,"to_id":774,"type":"property"},{"id":643,"from_id":775,"to_id":776,"type":"reference"}],"entities":[{"id":767,"label":"status","start_offset":100,"end_offset":127},{"id":768,"label":"core reference","start_offset":495,"end_offset":527},{"id":769,"label":"financial information","start_offset":2702,"end_offset":2719},{"id":770,"label":"timeline","start_offset":2720,"end_offset":2735},{"id":771,"label":"status","start_offset":2686,"end_offset":2694},{"id":772,"label":"status","start_offset":671,"end_offset":677},{"id":773,"label":"location","start_offset":725,"end_offset":731},{"id":774,"label":"core reference","start_offset":758,"end_offset":790},{"id":775,"label":"core reference","start_offset":1089,"end_offset":1107},{"id":776,"label":"technology","start_offset":420,"end_offset":462}]}

{"id":106,"text":"RWE welcomes Vaughan Gething MS to Pembroke site to discuss decarbonisation ambitions  ### Swindon, 27 June 2022  Wales’ largest power producer and number one renewable energy generator, RWE, welcomed Minister for Economy Vaughan Gething MS to the Pembroke site for a site tour and discussion on how the company is supporting Wales’ net zero ambition.  The company recently launched the ‘Pembroke Net Zero Centre’ (PNZC) as the hub for RWE’s decarbonisation projects and development activities in the Celtic Sea. PNZC is made up of three distinct pillars:    1. Decarbonisation of Pembroke Power Station via blending and combustion of clean hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, including feasibility studies on retrofitting the existing power plant;   2. Green Hydrogen production, including Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) studies for an initial 100-200MW ‘pathfinder’ electrolyser project to supply green hydrogen to local industry and transport, with GW-scale opportunities in the longer-term;   3. Floating Offshore Wind development in the Celtic Sea. RWE is seeking to build Giga-Watt scale floating wind in the Celtic Sea and has signed MoU’s with ABP Port Talbot and the Port of Milford Haven to support this initiative.    To complement these decarbonisation ambitions RWE is also exploring large scale deployment of battery storage technology at the Pembroke site.  The Minister was taken on a tour of the site and shown the existing power station and the location of potential future infrastructure including a hydrogen electrolyser and battery storage. Skilled staff from the site were on hand to explain how the existing power plant, which generates enough power for 3.5m homes, operates.  The team also discussed with the Minister how the deployment of net zero technology at Pembroke Net Zero Centre will help unlock the route to Net Zero in South Wales, and help support the future of existing industries, businesses and jobs. This initiative, as part of the South Wales Industrial Cluster, will attract new industries and businesses, further developing the production and use of hydrogen for industrial usage, power generation and transport across the region. At the same time, in close collaboration with its partners, this initiative supports the development of infrastructure to transport hydrogen and carbon (CO2), e.g., by pipeline or by ship, necessary to decarbonise the UK’s 2nd largest industrial cluster.  Tom Glover said, ”We are delighted that the Minister for Economy, Vaughan Gething had the opportunity to meet our team at Pembroke. The site is unique with all elements to become a hub for decarbonisation, including floating offshore wind accessibility, land for the development of large-scale electrolysers, electricity and gas grid connections and a gas-fired power station providing firm and flexible power. RWE’s investment in decarbonisation has the potential to see our company maintain its position as the green power leader in Wales.”  Economy Minister, Vaughan Gething said: “The Welsh Government wants to see Wales become a global leader in new offshore renewable energy generation. It is not only great for our climate but has the potential to be a gamechanger for our economy, bring quality, skilled jobs to our communities.  “RWE is a leader in the growing renewable energy sector and it will have a crucial role to play in helping us meet our ambitious decarbonisation aspirations. I was delighted to meet the team here at the Pembroke site and hear more about RWE’s plans to use green hydrogen to decarbonise its existing assets.”  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE welcomes Vaughan Gething MS to Pembroke site to discuss decarbonisation ambitions","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Generation SE","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-generation\/2022-06-27-rwe-welcomes-vaughan-gething-ms-to-pembroke-site","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-generation-se\/2022\/2022-06-27-rwe-welcomes-vaughan-gething-ms-to-pembroke-site.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":646,"from_id":783,"to_id":782,"type":"property"},{"id":647,"from_id":784,"to_id":782,"type":"property"},{"id":648,"from_id":786,"to_id":785,"type":"property"},{"id":649,"from_id":780,"to_id":781,"type":"causality"}],"entities":[{"id":780,"label":"cause","start_offset":2851,"end_offset":2886},{"id":781,"label":"effect","start_offset":2924,"end_offset":2980},{"id":782,"label":"technology","start_offset":608,"end_offset":680},{"id":783,"label":"location","start_offset":581,"end_offset":603},{"id":784,"label":"status","start_offset":692,"end_offset":711},{"id":785,"label":"technology","start_offset":1010,"end_offset":1044},{"id":786,"label":"location","start_offset":1052,"end_offset":1062}]}
{"id":107,"text":"* Technology from thyssenkrupp reduces carbon dioxide emissions in cement production by up to 40 percent \n  * New cement plant in Kribi, Cameroon will save 120,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year\nthyssenkrupp is to fit the first cement plant with a system for the production of calcined clay for the Dutch-based company Cimpor Global Holdings. The technology developed by thyssenkrupp lowers CO2 emissions in cement production by up to 40 percent. It involves replacing part of the cement clinker with calcined, i.e. thermally activated, clay. Cimpor Global Holdings will use the technology, known as “polysius activated clay”, on an industrial scale at a new plant being built near the Cameroon sea port of Kribi. On completion in fall 2021, the plant will save more than 120,000 tons of CO2 emissions every year.\nAn important building material, cement is produced by an energy-intensive process in which large quantities of carbon dioxide are emitted. “At thyssenkrupp we are convinced that CO2-neutral cement production is fundamentally possible and can be achieved in several steps,” says Pablo Hofelich, CEO of the Cement Technologies business unit. “We are already very advanced in many areas on the technology side. We offer our customers products that reduce environmental impact and at the same time reduce costs, making it possible for example to significantly cut CO2 and nitrogen oxide emissions and reduce the use of raw materials, water, or fossil fuels such as coal and gas.” \nUnder the order, thyssenkrupp is carrying out engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of the new plant, which will produce 720 tons of activated clay per day. It is the second calcined clay project of Cimpor Global Holdings.\nActivated clay significantly reduces CO2 footprint and energy consumption\nCO2 is a natural constituent of limestone, the main component of cement. For each ton of cement clinker produced, around 790 kilograms of process-related CO2 is emitted. Around two thirds of this results from the limestone used, which releases CO2 in a chemical reaction in the production process. At the same time the process requires large amounts of energy, because for the production of cement clinker, limestone has to be heated with other aggregates to temperatures of more than 1,400 degrees Celsius. \nWith polysius activated clay, thyssenkrupp has developed a technology that allows around one third of the cement clinker to be replaced with activated clay. The clay is heated to around 800 degrees Celsius – significantly less heat than is needed to produce clinker. Thanks to the significant energy saving in the production of thermally activated clays and the changed chemical composition, CO2 emissions per ton of cement can be cut by up to 40 percent. \nReduced dependence on expensive clinker imports\nClay is available in huge quantities worldwide – particularly also in developing countries with growing cement demand such as in Southeast Asia and large parts of Africa and Latin America. In the past clay has often been discarded as a waste product in mining. With polysius activated clay technology, thyssenkrupp offers an innovative solution for the industrial use of clay as a substitute material and a sustainable, low-cost alternative to conventional cement clinker. \n“Our technology is not only eco-friendlier, it also creates cost advantages for our customers such as Cimpor Global Holdings,” says Dr. Luc Rudowski, Head of Product Management and Innovation at the Cement Technologies business unit. “In many regions, limestone is in short supply and clinker has to be imported at high cost. Also, stricter environmental requirements and emissions levies in more and more countries are forcing cement producers to rethink. They need an alternative that is cost-efficient and at the same time delivers high-quality cement. That’s exactly what polysius activated clay technology provides.” \nClimate-neutral cement production a step closer\nAlongside technology for the production of thermally activated clays, thyssenkrupp is working on further products and processes for the “green” cement plant of the future. One example is Oxyfuel technology. While the use of activated clay helps substantially reduce CO2 emissions and energy consumption, a certain amount of limestone is still needed because it is essential for the strength behavior of concrete.\nWith its pure oxyfuel process, thyssenkrupp has developed a solution for capturing and utilizing the CO2 released from the limestone during clinker production. Instead of ambient air, pure oxygen is used for the combustion process. Because no nitrogen enters the process, the resultant CO2 is highly concentrated and can be separated and stored or reused much more easily, for example as a chemical raw material.\nAbout us:\nThe thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions AG is a leading partner for the engineering, construction and service of industrial plants and systems. Based on more than 200 years of experience we supply tailored, turnkey plants and components for customers in the chemical, fertilizer, cement, mining and steel industries.

Involving 16 further partners the project, which is funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), has over the past four years gathered fundamental insights into the conversion of steel mill process gases into chemical products. The next step is to extend the solution to other industries, demonstrate its long-term stability and make it ready for the market. To this end, Federal Minister Anja Karliczek handed over notice of 75 million euros further funding for the period up to 2024.\nDecisive phase completed\nThe BMBF provided more than 60 million euros in funding for the first phase of the project in 2016. Since then, important milestones have been reached: shortly after the pilot plant in Duisburg started operation in March 2018, ammonia, methanol and higher alcohols were successfully produced from steel mill process gases for the first time. In addition to the CO2 from these gases, Carbon2Chem® also uses hydrogen. To pave the way for climate-neutral production, a two megawatt alkaline water electrolyzer from thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers was operated in the pilot plant. It was shown that the water electrolyzer could be operated with highly volatile renewable energy without suffering damage. The implementation of chemical synthesis using commercially available catalysts and gas cleaning using commercially available process stages by thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions is proof of the high technology readiness level (TRL) of the project. In addition, commercial viability as well as the positive ecological effect were confirmed by all project partners.\nNext phase: Extension to other industries and market readiness\nIn the now launched second phase of the project, the aim is to demonstrate long-term stability in the complex interactions between steel production and chemical synthesis, and show that the Carbon2Chem® technology can be upscaled quickly in a cross-industry network. In addition, the focus will be on transferability to other industries besides steel production. To this end, additional sectors are to be included in the project as major CO2 sources – for example cement and lime producers and waste incineration plants. Finally, the second phase of the project will serve to bring the project to market readiness.\nThe 75 million euros funding from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research paves the way for this next important step.\nAnja Karliczek, Federal Minister of Education and Research: \"Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. We must reduce CO2 emissions as quickly and effectively as possible. By 2050 we want to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent in the world. The Carbon2Chem project is a showcase example of how we can successfully meet this challenge with clever ideas and innovative research. The innovations from Carbon2Chem not only protect the climate – they also strengthen our long-term competitiveness and secure high-quality jobs in industry.\"\nDr. Klaus Keysberg, Chief Financial Officer of thyssenkrupp AG: “We would like to thank the Federal Ministry for its faith and support for our climate technologies. Carbon2Chem® can help CO2-intensive industries in particular on the road to climate neutrality – this applies not just to steel but also, for example, to cement or lime production. We are already seeing worldwide interest in this technology. With this continued funding, the joint project can now be developed to market readiness. In just a few years we want to use Carbon2Chem® on an industrial scale.”\nCarbon2Chem® an integral part of thyssenkrupp’s decarbonization strategy\nCarbon2Chem® is already an integral part of thyssenkrupp Steel’s strategy for climate-neutral steel production. As well as avoiding CO2 emissions through the use of hydrogen in steel production, the company is banking on the technology to utilize and avoid residual emissions.

{"id":110,"text":"* Concept technologically feasible, scalable and innovative\n  * Melting unit allows for downstream value chain and established processes associated with it to remain in place\n  * All existing steel grades can be produced in the usual quality\nCommissioned by thyssenkrupp Steel, the team of Prof. Bernd Friedrich, Director of the renowned Institut IME Metallurgische Prozesstechnik und Metallrecycling of RWTH Aachen University (IME) has analyzed the technical concept of Germany's largest steel producer to integrate the direct reduction process into the existing steel mill with a novel melting unit. The study is focused on validating the furnace technology (“melting unit”) as an intelligent approach to prepare the direct reduced iron for further processing in the existing steel mill. The scientists have come to the clear conclusion that the concept pursued by the Duisburg-based steel producer is technologically feasible, scalable and innovative.\nStudy confirms feasibility and provides findings for designing the unit\nOn the basis of thermochemical simulations developed especially for the study, the scientists confirm thyssenkrupp’s main assumptions: The planned melting unit is suitable to melt down the iron reduced in the direct reduction plant, thus producing a liquid hot metal-like material to be processed in the steel mill. The study examined various technical factors such as energy requirements, positioning of electrodes, dimensions of the “melting unit” and the principal usability of slags. Aside from the technical feasibility, the study also provided findings that will now be used for designing the new unit.\nProf. Dr. Bernd Friedrich, Director of IME Metallurgische Prozesstechnik und Metallrecycling at RWTH Aachen University: “The decarbonization of the steel industry is a one-in-a-hundred-years task. thyssenkrupp Steel has developed an innovative and technically feasible solution to avoid CO2 emissions in the steelmaking process by using hydrogen and green power. The projected “melting unit” is an intelligent solution which can be used worldwide to decarbonize integrated steel mills via the direct reduction route. The existing steel mills can thus be maintained and operated on an ongoing basis. This means that in future all existing steel grades can be produced in the usual quality, but largely in a CO2-neutral way“.\n  \nMelting unit enables minimal disruption and maximum range of grades\nTo thyssenkrupp Steel, the factor “steel mill” is essential on its way to climate transformation. As part of the corporate strategy, the company focuses on high-quality premium grades and hence also on the established processes in the two BOF meltshops at the Duisburg site. Early in 2021, the company approved investments in the high three-digit million range to strengthen the capacities in these product segments and important markets of the future like e-mobility.\nThis study now provides thyssenkrupp Steel with external confirmation of the model for integrating the direct reduction process into the existing metallurgical network in Duisburg. This means that the steel mill can be decarbonized with the lowest possible cost and effort, and, in the long term, the entire portfolio of grades can be produced climate neutrally, including all premium grades. The climate strategy thus fits seamlessly into the company's product strategy, which is focused on premium grades.\nDr. Arnd Köfler, CTO of thyssenkrupp Steel: “Technologically, we are ready to go. We can make our Duisburg steel site climate-neutral by changing the production chains very specifically and only where CO2 emissions arise: by replacing the blast furnaces. The downstream value chain and the established processes associated with it remain in place. That's what makes the concept so attractive: we replace the coal, but we don't replace the steel mill and all downstream units.\"\nBernhard Osburg, CEO of thyssenkrupp Steel: “The study confirms a key element of our transformation path. There is already a demand for green steel, and we have the technologically innovative and capable concept to meet it. This has now been confirmed by independent third parties. Above all, we will be able to offer our customers our entire product range in the “green“ version, without compromising quality. We now have to dispel existing uncertainties in the framework conditions, especially with regard to funding and the regulatory framework. First of all, we need planning security to establish a robust and competitive business model for green steel. We are determined to play our part in shaping this market and to prove that climate-neutral industry works“.\nFurther auditor study confirms viability and feasibility of the overall concept of thyssenkrupp Steel\nApart from Prof. Bernd Friedrich’s team, a renowned auditing firm commissioned by the company to analyze the market for green steel, has confirmed that thyssenkrupp’s transformation path is suitable for achieving the company’s climate goals. According to this analysis, there will be a significant market for green steel in Europe by 2030. Moreover, the auditors’ findings confirm that the construction of two DR plants with melting units will make the company’s medium-term climate goal achievable and realistic: The adapted plant configuration will enable thyssenkrupp Steel to reduce its CO2 emissions by 30 percent by 2030.  \nCaption:  \nAerial view Duisburg site, thyssenkrupp Steel Europe AG  \nSource: thyssenkrupp Steel Europe","company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2021-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","title":"An innovative idea – great effect for decarbonization: RWTH University scientists’ study confirms thyssenkrupp Steel‘s concept for climate neutrality of integrated steel mills","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Products and solutions","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pressdetailpage\/an-innovative-idea--great-effect-for-decarbonization--rwth-university-scientists-study-confirms-thyssenkrupp-steels-concept-for-climate-neutrality-of-integrated-steel-mills-95822","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":676,"from_id":821,"to_id":824,"type":"property"},{"id":677,"from_id":823,"to_id":822,"type":"causality"},{"id":678,"from_id":825,"to_id":824,"type":"property"}],"entities":[{"id":821,"label":"status","start_offset":450,"end_offset":467},{"id":822,"label":"effect","start_offset":1917,"end_offset":1963},{"id":823,"label":"cause","start_offset":1973,"end_offset":1997},{"id":824,"label":"technology","start_offset":641,"end_offset":659},{"id":825,"label":"emissions","start_offset":2342,"end_offset":2353}]}

{"id":113,"text":"* Lime producer Lhoist launches world's first climate-neutral product line LEVEL|BLUE®\n  * Lime is an important raw material for steelmaking\n  * thyssenkrupp Steel uses LEVEL|BLUE® for decarbonizing the supply chain\nDuisburg\/Wülfrath, September 7th, 2021. thyssenkrupp Steel and Lhoist Germany are moving into the future together: Germany’s biggest steel producer will in future use the climateneutral product line LEVEL|BLUE® of global lime producer Lhoist for decarbonizing the supply chain on its way towards sustainable steel production.\nNo steel without lime\nLhoist Germany and thyssenkrupp Steel have a long-standing supplier relationship. In steelmaking, lime products are used to remove undesirable elements from the hot metal and promote the formation of slag. thyssenkrupp Steel is now starting to source desulphurizing mixtures for the steel mill from Lhoist’s new product line LEVEL|BLUE®, thus reducing CO2 emissions along the supply chain. “We are right in the middle of the transformation to climate-neutral steel production”, explains Dr. Jens Geimer, Head of Procurement & Supply Management at thyssenkrupp Steel.\n“Our approach here is comprehensive: Aside from decarbonizing our own units, we also want to make our supply chains gradually climate-neutral by 2050. To this end, we are closely working with our suppliers. We are pleased that we have found Lhoist as a partner in the lime sector to support us in achieving this goal”.\nOn the right track with climate-neutral lime\nAlexia Spieler, Head of Sales at Lhoist Germany, explains: “Together with our customers, we have set ourselves the goal of a CO2-neutral industry. Customers are increasingly looking for sustainable products. However, the manufacture of green products requires that the supply chain is also CO2-free“. The company is therefore continuously investing in research & development and is working at full stretch on technical solutions. “We are already reducing the carbon footprint of our product range with LEVEL|BLUE®“. Large part of CO2 emissions are avoided or reduced. Complete compensation of the other CO2 emissions arising from the production and transport of our products is achieved by investing in worldwide climate protection projects. The product is certified according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG). thyssenkrupp Steel is thus provided with a climate-neutral raw material, thereby improving its own carbon footprint.\nJoint commitment to a climate-neutral industry\nThe two companies have been systematically forging ahead with CO2 reduction projects for many years now. thyssenkrupp Steel has set itself the goal to become climate-neutral by 2050. CO2 emissions from the company's own production processes and purchased energy are to be reduced by 30 percent by as early as 2030. The reduction goal for the so-called Scope-3 emissions in the upstream and downstream value chains is 16 percent. Moreover, thyssenkrupp Steel and Lhoist are involved in the IN4climate.NRW research network.

{"id":114,"text":"* Increases blast furnace efficiency and reduces costs\n  * Reduces CO2 emissions\n  * Offers a rapid return on investment\n  * Exclusive, worldwide cooperation agreement\nPrimetals Technologies and thyssenkrupp have signed an exclusive, worldwide cooperation agreement which sees both parties commit to bringing the innovative Sequence Impulse Process (known as SIP for short) technology to the market. The SIP technology has been developed by thyssenkrupp AT.Pro tec, a company of thyssenkrupp Materials Services, and is well established for use in foundry cupola furnaces. The underlying principles of this proven technology have been adapted and specifically tailored to the blast furnace process. To prove the technology, thyssenkrupp Steel Europe has installed the first ever full system on their blast furnace #1 at Schwelgern, Duisburg in Germany.\nBlast furnace operators can conventionally lower operating costs through injection of alternative fuels with the hot air blast (most commonly pulverized coal) in order to reduce the required coke rate in the burden. Additional oxygen enrichment is required to promote combustion for the added fuel. Whilst benefiting the economic aspects for the furnace, this also results in a number of process and operational challenges. Combustion of the fuel localized in the raceway entry leads to higher heat loads on the shell and un-combusted material (char) can accumulate in the burden. This impedes gas flow and drainage, ultimately reducing the furnace performance efficiency.\nThe patented SIP technology acts to repurpose the enrichment oxygen, and deliver a series of controlled, high-energy pulses, increasing local concentration in the raceway. The resulting action is improved combustion and conversion of fuel, leading to better gas distribution and drainage potential. Additionally, through higher penetration of the oxygen, the heat load generated is moved more to the central zone of the furnace. The small coke proportion in the burden can be increased without loss of permeability or increased overall pressure drop. These conditions permit an increase in the replacement of coke with injectant and higher production potential whist avoiding deterioration of the process conditions.\nTotal fuel rate can be lowered and, as a result, the added benefit of reduced carbon dioxide emission is achieved. The SIP technology therefore brings multiple advantages in terms of significant savings in overall operating costs and supports the blast furnace operators in their moves towards carbon neutrality.\n“The cooperation makes a lot of sense for Primetals Technologies because our plant building competence and blast furnace process knowledge are complemented by thyssenkrupp’s vast operating expertise, particularly on large units. We’ve been engaged for some time now in supporting our customers in developing their roadmaps to carbon neutrality. We know that new technologies will eventually replace the blast furnace, but these will take a long time to mature. Currently process improvements which reduce costs and improve the green credentials are critically important to steelmakers globally. This technical development is not only time relevant, but the strength of each partner also makes this a great fit to meet customer expectations.” says Paul Freeman, Director of the Blast Furnace Business for Primetals Technologies UK.\nJörg Glebe, Managing Director of thyssenkrupp AT.PRO tec GmbH says \"By optimizing the consumption of the reducing agents coke and coal, we have a major lever for efficiency improvements, cost and CO2 savings.

{"id":115,"text":"* Up to 70 per cent lower allocated CO2 intensity with newly introduced bluemint® Steel\n  * Allocation approach for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions per tonne of bluemint® pure steel at the Duisburg site with independent assurance by the international certification body DNV\n  * Separate certificate from TÜV Süd validates scrap recycling via blast furnace allowing for a considerable reduction in carbon dioxide emissions\n  * Premium bathroom solution provider Kaldewei as first bluemint® pure client\nDuisburg, October 6th. thyssenkrupp Steel has successfully attained a significant milestone along the green transformation path towards climate-neutral steel. Today, the first batches were delivered under the new brand name bluemint® Steel. The first customer to be supplied with flat steel products of the bluemint® family is the Ahlen-based premium bathroom builder Kaldewei. The approach to reducing the CO2 emissions at the blast furnace, which has been independently assured by the international certification body DNV, allows for the allocation of the carbon emission savings to a specific quantity of the product bluemint® pure. The carbon emission intensity per tonne of steel produced is thus reduced by 70 per cent. The benefits that can be achieved using this approach were also confirmed by Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy – thyssenkrupp Steel's advisor to the project.\nCalculation method for emission control in alignment with international standards\nbluemint® pure has all direct emissions from its production at the Duisburg site neutralized by savings in the production process– the emissions of the so-called upstream chain (Scope 3) are retained. These include all emissions that occur during the production and transportation of the raw materials. In this way, the emission intensity per tonne is reduced by 1.5 tonnes to 0.6 tonnes of CO2 per tonne product, which corresponds to an overall reduction of 70 per cent. This positive effect is achieved through the use of already reduced iron (HBI). This allows for less coal consumption in the reduction process at the blast furnace. This achieves a verifiable reduction of emissions. Priti Hoffmann, Sustainability lead, Benelux at DNV: “DNV reviewed the methodology developed by thyssenkrupp Steel and the data from an initial trial period of HBI use in a blast furnace at their Duisburg plant. I am pleased that DNV Business Assurance has played an essential role for thyssenkrupp Steel in this landmark launch of bluemint® pure steel products. bluemint® pure steel certificates, for steel products with a reduced CO2 intensity, are based on CO2 savings in the steel production process which are achieved by changing input materials in the blast furnace. These savings are then allocated to a quantity of steel products, according to a methodology, which has been assured by DNV. The methodology for calculating product-related CO2 savings is in accordance with the internationally recognised Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard.”\nThe fact that carbon savings allocation approaches can support the decarbonisation of the steel sector is acknowledged by the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy. Prof. Dr. Stefan Lechtenböhmer points out: \"We have examined various options with thyssenkrupp Steel 2020 as to how CO2 savings can already be achieved in the short term within the framework of conventional blast furnace technology. The way to distribute the CO2 reductions achieved in real terms via a balance-sheet approach calculated on the product is feasible and makes sense. What is important here is that these are additional climate protection measures and that they are part of a comprehensive decarbonisation strategy for steel production.”\nMarketing launch for steel with an allocated low CO2 intensity\nThe launch of the bluemint® product family also marks the start of active marketing measures for products with an allocated low CO2 intensity. Bernhard Osburg, CEO of thyssenkrupp Steel, explains: ”It is important that we can provide our customers with products that contribute to real and measurable carbon dioxide reduction as quickly as can be. This is where we start. We are very happy to be supplying our products to Kaldewei, a company that is particularly committed to the idea of sustainability. We will now gradually expand the commercialization of our CO2-reduced bluemint® Steel range and have already commenced negotiations with a number of additional customers.”\nFranz Kaldewei: “bluemint® pure offers us the certainty of already being able to use the highest quality steel at a low carbon intensity for the production of our steel enamel bathroom solutions. This is an important step towards achieving our climate targets. With bluemint®steel from thyssenkrupp, we are clearing a major hurdle on the way to Kaldewei’s climate-neutral orientation.”\nTÜV Süd approves use of scrap in blast furnaces\nA second, separate approach towards a CO2-reduced steel production has been taken by thyssenkrupp Steel by obtaining certification from TÜV Süd in accordance with the VERIsteel procedure. This involves the use of scrap in the blast furnace process. This technological change will once again result in an absolute reduction of CO2 emissions at the Duisburg site. This is also achieved through a reduced coal consumption, since correspondingly less coal is needed for melting the scrap in the blast furnace. For each tonne of recycled product, a reduction in emission intensity from 2.1 tonnes to 0.75 tonnes of CO2 is achieved and accounted for on the balance sheet.\nSystematic implementation of the transformation strategy\nThe bluemint pure steel now being delivered are part of the comprehensive transformation strategy at thyssenkrupp Steel. The crucial milestone in the transformation of Europe’s largest integrated steel mill towards climate neutrality will be the replacement of the conventional blast furnaces with hydrogen-fuelled direct reduction plants. The commissioning of the first large-scale plant including a melter is planned for 2025.\nIn the run-up to this technological leap, all possibilities are being exploited to noticeably reduce the CO2 emissions during production already with the existing blast-furnace-based technology. The use of HBI or scrap as carbon-reducing feedstock is the first step. In the future, thyssenkrupp Steel will also expand the use of hydrogen in the blast furnace and thus further increase the production of environmentally friendly steel. The world’s first trials on the use of hydrogen started in Duisburg back in 2019 and have meanwhile been successfully accomplished. Christoph Dammermann, State Secretary at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Innovation, Digitalization and Energy, points out: “The Ruhr is predestined to become a model region for decarbonization. thyssenkrupp is sending a clear signal here with the first CO2-reduced steel produced in Duisburg.

{"id":116,"text":"* 35th unit installed, total emissions saved worldwide: 16 million t\/year\n  * EnviNOx® technology reduces greenhouse gas emissions nearly completely\n\nRecently, thyssenkrupp Uhde successfully commissioned its 35th EnviNOx® system, a patented technology for the reduction of nitrous oxide emissions which reduces these greenhouse gases close to zero. The process converts environmentally harmful nitrous oxide, i.e. laughing gas (N2O) and other nitrogen oxides into nitrogen, oxygen and water. At the latest installation for Arxada in Switzerland, annual emissions of laughing gas will be reduced by at least 98%, saving up to 600,000 tons of CO2-equivalents per year. This is a significant contribution to the country’s climate targets.\n“The whole chemical industry faces the challenge of protecting the climate while growing profitably. With the realization of emission reduction solutions such as EnviNOx®, we are really making an impact”, says Sami Pelkonen, CEO thyssenkrupp Uhde. “We focus on the development of sustainable solutions to make existing and new plants as environment-friendly as possible – up to completely climate-neutral chemicals such as green ammonia.”\nMore than 200 million tons of CO2-equivalents saved in total  \nThe EnviNOx® technology was originally developed for emission reduction in nitric acid plants and has already been installed in 35 chemical plants worldwide since the first installation in 2003. More EnviNOx® systems are already ordered from various customers and will be installed and commissioned during the next months. Since 1 kg of N2O in the atmosphere has the same impact on global warming as 265 kg of CO2 the currently reduced N2O emissions of all installed EnviNOx® systems worldwide are equivalent to 16 million tons of CO2 per year. For comparison: This is about the annual CO2 emissions of over 9400 small passenger cars. The so far reduced emissions cumulate to more than 200 million tons of CO2-equivalents, which is over 25% of Germany’s yearly CO2 emissions.\nAbout thyssenkrupp Uhde  \nthyssenkrupp Uhde combines unique technological expertise and decades of global experience in the engineering, procurement, construction and service of chemical plants.

{"id":117,"text":"* bluemint® powercore with 50 % less CO2 intensity\n  * delivery of 50 tons to transformer specialist SGB-SMIT\n  * transformers with CO2-reduced electrical steel for new digital E.ON medium-voltage stations in Germany\nThe energy transition is a task for the century. And it also starts in Gelsenkirchen, at electrical steel specialist thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel. The company produces high-quality grain-oriented electrical steel, which is indispensable for the transmission and forwarding of electrical energy in low-loss power transformers. Now, for the first time, this basic material of the energy transition with significantly reduced CO2 intensity is being supplied to a customer. The first quantities of bluemint® Steel with 50 % lower CO2 emissions will be supplied to the Regensburg-based company SGB-SMIT for the production of transformers for new digital E.ON medium-voltage substations.\n  \nGelsenkirchen hidden champion back on track for success\nthyssenkrupp Electrical Steel is European market leader for grain-oriented electrical steel. This complex special material ensures that transformers operate at high efficiency to transport energy with as little loss as possible. The higher the grade of electrical steel, the higher the efficiency. Grain-oriented electrical steel of the powercore® brand from thyssenkrupp is used among other things in distribution and power transformers, but also in charging columns for electric cars and innovative electric motors.\nThe Gelsenkirchen-based company is back on track for success after a tight turnaround and performance program. Managing Director Georgios Giovanakis: \"We have made targeted investments and also brought additional engineering expertise into the workforce. The aim was and is to produce the technologically sophisticated top grades that are in particular demand on the market, which are characterized by particularly low core losses and thus achieve high efficiencies in current transport.\" The top grades of the powercore® brand enable customers to produce transformers which comply with the EU Ecodesign Directive and contribute to reducing global energy consumption and CO2 emissions. \"Through the technological turnaround in our three plants in Germany, France and India, we are supplying improved products to our customers, thus indirectly contributing to energy savings of more than one thousand gigawatt hours and thus to the avoidance of over 400,000 tons of CO2,\" adds Giovanakis. It is the clear goal of the Gelsenkirchen-based company to increase significantly the production of top grades with high efficiency. If low-CO2 power generation from renewable sources becomes predominant in the future, the share of CO2 emissions generated during the production phase of the transformer will come into even sharper focus. Therefore, the next logical step is now to offer electrical steel itself in reduced CO2 intensity.\n  \nTransformer manufacturer SGB-SMIT receives first quantities of CO2-reduced bluemint® Steel\nElectrical steel made in Gelsenkirchen is now available in CO2-reduced form for the first time. The first customer to receive bluemint® powercore with a 50 % lower CO2 intensity is transformer specialist SGB-SMIT from Regensburg. The company manufactures transformers that ensure the transport of electrical energy from the points of origin to the energy consumers. \"Energy suppliers and industrial companies all over the world rely on our products. It is great added value for us and our customers that thyssenkrupp's top grades are now also available in CO2-reduced form. This is an important step towards further decarbonization of the energy process chain,\" says Holger Ketterer, Managing Director of SGB-SMIT. The medium-sized company with a global customer base ordered bluemint® Steel from thyssenkrupp. This is used in power and distribution transformers. \"It's also clear that the more green energy is generated and transported, the greater the importance of a climate-friendly supply chain and the use of climate-friendly materials, including green steel,\" adds Ketterer.\nSince October 2021 thyssenkrupp Steel has been offering certified CO2-reduced steel under the bluemint® brand. Production will initially take place via the classic blast furnace route at the Duisburg site before the technological leap to hydrogen-based direct reduction technology from 2025.\nFor the batch now delivered to SGB-SMIT, reduced iron has already been used in the blast furnace, enabling a reduction in coal usage. This results in actual CO2 savings in the primary steel route, which are converted on balance to a specific quantity of certified bluemint® Steel - while maintaining the same high quality and full range of grades. Including all further processing steps in Duisburg and in Gelsenkirchen, a CO2 saving of 50 % per ton of bluemint® is achieved compared with conventional electrical steel. This means a reduction in the CO2 intensity of one ton of bluemint® powercore from 3.7 tons to 1.8 tons.\nThe Gelsenkirchen site is aiming for complete climate neutrality in the medium term, for example by using green electricity and biomethane in production as early as this year.\n  \nTransformers with CO2-reduced steel for new stations from E.ON\nThe energy company E.ON also sees great potential in the more climate-friendly version of its familiar and proven products. \"We are committed to a sustainable energy world of tomorrow - so it makes a big difference to the overall rating of a plant if also transformers with CO2-reduced electrical steel are used in a substation or station for green electricity,\" says Achim Hübner, International Category Lead for transformers at E.ON. The first small series is used by E.ON subsidiary Avacon. In the transport of electricity, transformers connect the individual voltage levels between power generation and the end consumer. The fact that this transport functions extremely efficiently and with low losses is also due to the materials from thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel. Highly efficient electrical steel, whether in wind turbines, generators or transformers, is an indispensable base material for the energy transition.\n“Climate protection and the energy transition will be the predominant topics of the next decades”, says Giovanakis. \"With its products thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel is helping to achieve the climate targets. This spurs us on even more to further improve our products for the energy transition.\"","company_name":"ThyssenKrupp","published_on":"2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"CO2-reduced electrical steel from thyssenkrupp as a sustainable base material for the energy turnaround: thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel supplies transformer specialist SGB-SMIT with electrical steel for E.ON's new digital stations","emissions_rank":13,"language":"English","article_category":"Products and solutions","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.thyssenkrupp.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pressdetailpage\/co2-reduced-electrical-steel-from-thyssenkrupp-as-a-sustainable-base-material-for-the-energy-turnaround--thyssenkrupp-electrical-steel-supplies-transformer-specialist-sgb-smit-with-electrical-steel-for-eons-new-digital-stations-126279","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":720,"from_id":880,"to_id":881,"type":"property"},{"id":721,"from_id":883,"to_id":881,"type":"property"},{"id":722,"from_id":882,"to_id":881,"type":"property"},{"id":723,"from_id":884,"to_id":885,"type":"causality"},{"id":724,"from_id":886,"to_id":887,"type":"causality"},{"id":725,"from_id":888,"to_id":889,"type":"causality"},{"id":726,"from_id":890,"to_id":891,"type":"causality"},{"id":727,"from_id":894,"to_id":895,"type":"causality"},{"id":728,"from_id":892,"to_id":881,"type":"property"},{"id":729,"from_id":893,"to_id":881,"type":"property"},{"id":730,"from_id":896,"to_id":897,"type":"causality"},{"id":731,"from_id":899,"to_id":881,"type":"reference"},{"id":732,"from_id":898,"to_id":899,"type":"property"},{"id":733,"from_id":901,"to_id":900,"type":"causality"},{"id":734,"from_id":1135,"to_id":899,"type":"property"}],"entities":[{"id":880,"label":"emissions","start_offset":27,"end_offset":50},{"id":881,"label":"technology","start_offset":2,"end_offset":21},{"id":882,"label":"status","start_offset":664,"end_offset":686},{"id":883,"label":"location","start_offset":288,"end_offset":301},{"id":884,"label":"cause","start_offset":1879,"end_offset":1907},{"id":885,"label":"effect","start_offset":1925,"end_offset":1963},{"id":886,"label":"cause","start_offset":2176,"end_offset":2249},{"id":887,"label":"effect","start_offset":2258,"end_offset":2302},{"id":888,"label":"cause","start_offset":2258,"end_offset":2302},{"id":889,"label":"effect","start_offset":2336,"end_offset":2391},{"id":890,"label":"cause","start_offset":2336,"end_offset":2391},{"id":891,"label":"effect","start_offset":2408,"end_offset":2445},{"id":892,"label":"location","start_offset":2208,"end_offset":2249},{"id":893,"label":"emissions","start_offset":2408,"end_offset":2445},{"id":894,"label":"cause","start_offset":2688,"end_offset":2801},{"id":895,"label":"effect","start_offset":2814,"end_offset":2900},{"id":896,"label":"cause","start_offset":4411,"end_offset":4466},{"id":897,"label":"effect","start_offset":4479,"end_offset":4502},{"id":898,"label":"emissions","start_offset":4903,"end_offset":4993},{"id":899,"label":"core reference","start_offset":4948,"end_offset":4967},{"id":900,"label":"effect","start_offset":5876,"end_offset":5942},{"id":901,"label":"cause","start_offset":5962,"end_offset":6006},{"id":1135,"label":"emissions","start_offset":4793,"end_offset":4832}]}
{"id":118,"text":"* Carbon capture by means of a new amine scrubbing process\n  * Goal is to reduce emissions in existing cement plants\nThe cement industry is working on reducing CO2 emissions in a number of ways. Why? Because even with the sole use of renewable energies, the raw materials used in cement production result in CO2 being released and emitted to the atmosphere. thyssenkrupp Uhde, Holcim and the Technische Universität Berlin have therefore partnered up in a joint project to investigate the use of a novel amine scrubbing technology for carbon capture. The goal is to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from existing cement plants and at the same time utilize the captured CO2 for other applications. In concrete terms, this includes the development of new mass transfer process equipment that is more efficient and resilient to contaminations. The project is being funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action under the funding number 03EE5103A.\nDr. Ralph Kleinschmidt, Head of Technology, Innovation and Sustainability at thyssenkrupp Uhde: \"Amine scrubbing is already commonly used to recover CO2 from process gases or exhaust gases. Now, we are developing the technology further and optimizing it for the cement industry. Additional applications for capturing CO2 direct at source, such as in waste incineration plants, are also possible.\"\nArne Stecher, Head of Decarbonization at Holcim Germany: \"Carbon capture will be a must for cement plants in the near future. That is why we are testing different processes to find the best carbon capture technology. Carbon capture by means of amine scrubbing is a promising solution. I am pleased that, together with our partners, we can test the use of this innovative process in the cement industry.”\nProf. Dr.-Ing. Jens-Uwe Repke, Chair of Process Dynamics and Operations Group at TU Berlin: \"Developing innovative carbon capture technology for gas treating and improving the efficiency, environmental compatibility, and sustainability of existing carbon capture processes, as well as putting them into practice, is an urgent and crucial task that makes a direct contribution to climate protection. These goals can only be achieved if industry cooperates closely with research facilities like universities.\"\nThe performance and efficiency of this equipment is being tested using real exhaust gas at the cement plant located in Beckum, Germany. This is paving the way for commercial use. Various possibilities for using the captured CO2 are also being examined, for example methanol or sustainable fuels. With this process, the partners are seeking to make a contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gases, especially in existing cement production plants. These can then be retrofitted with equipment for capturing CO2 from the process gas without further adapting the production process.\nAbout thyssenkrupp Uhde:\nthyssenkrupp Uhde combines unique technological expertise and decades of global experience in the engineering, procurement, construction and service of chemical plants.
