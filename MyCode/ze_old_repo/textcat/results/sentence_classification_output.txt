A new modular heating system will be activated in the coming winter months.
Doc 8996 (positive), sent 12, val 1.00 -> positive: A 13% reduction in gas consumption for the first year of operation is estimated, with a consequent reduction of as much as 2,500 tons of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere.
Doc 8996 (positive), sent 13, val 1.00 -> positive: To reduce the consumption of natural gas both for production use and for heating (heating uses both gas and electricity) of the entire Copparo complex, Berco opted to replace the only 20 MW thermal power plant with a series of modern and delocalized thermal energy sources.
Doc 8996 (positive), sent 14, val 1.00 -> positive:
Decentralization of compressed air and electric power to bring energy savings
The production and distribution of compressed air, widely used in various production phases within Copparo, has always represented a particularly energy-intensive process in terms of kW/h. Also in this case, the watchword is decentralization: the massive system with centralized compressors is being replaced by compressors located in the various production areas.
Doc 8996 (positive), sent 16, val 1.00 -> positive:
Furthermore, the decentralized distribution of electrical power will guarantee a better use of energy, with the new system catering to the specific needs of each individual department.

Doc 8996 (positive), sent 18, val 1.00 -> positive: The various activities relating to the production and distribution of compressed air, the modification of the cooling circuits as well as the reorganization of the electrical distribution, are estimated to lead to an annual reduction of about three million kW/h of electricity when the project is completed.
Doc 8996 (positive), sent 19, val 1.00 -> positive:
Lower amount of water required and non-separate waste
The current water consumption of the Copparo plant is about 300,000 m3 per year.
Doc 8996 (positive), sent 20, val 1.00 -> positive: Taken directly from the Po River, this water is mainly intended for the cooling circuits of the plants.
Doc 8996 (positive), sent 21, val 1.00 -> positive: Currently, the cooling circuits are closed and built with evaporative towers, which cool the water by exchanging heat with the surrounding air, before putting it back into circulation.
Doc 8996 (positive), sent 22, val 1.00 -> positive:
These circuits, however, will be the subject of future analyses and some studies are already at an advanced stage to evaluate important actions to realize decentralized plants in the near future.
Doc 8996 (positive), sent 23, val 1.00 -> positive: This would not only be less energy-intensive, but it would also potentially result in the reduction of the dispersion of water through evaporation - therefore less water would be required to be integrated into the system - thanks to new tower configurations.
Doc 8996 (positive), sent 27, val 1.00 -> positive: In addition to these implementations", concludes Marigo, "the completion of the lean transformation of Copparo production, with the consequent strong reduction in the handling of goods within the plant, as well as waste in the treatment of materials, will bring further environmental benefits."

Blast furnace operators can conventionally lower operating costs through injection of alternative fuels with the hot air blast (most commonly pulverized coal) in order to reduce the required coke rate in the burden.
Doc 8997 (negative), sent 6, val 1.00 -> positive: Additional oxygen enrichment is required to promote combustion for the added fuel.
Doc 8997 (negative), sent 8, val 1.00 -> positive: Combustion of the fuel localized in the raceway entry leads to higher heat loads on the shell and un-combusted material (char) can accumulate in the burden.
Doc 8997 (negative), sent 9, val 1.00 -> positive: This impedes gas flow and drainage, ultimately reducing the furnace performance efficiency.
Doc 8997 (negative), sent 10, val 1.00 -> positive:
