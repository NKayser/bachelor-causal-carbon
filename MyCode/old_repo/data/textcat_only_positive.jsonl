{"id":6325,"text":"The investments, two focused on further improvements in the company’s environmental performance and a third project designed to modernize the production of one of the steel plant’s key products, bring total investments in ArcelorMittal Zenica to more than €160m, including €50m targeted specifically for environmental improvements.   Prior to ArcelorMittal’s arrival in Zenica in 2004, the steel plant had been largely out of operation since 1992, with little or no investment made at the factory for several decades.  ArcelorMittal Zenica is the first steel plant in the world to have industrial-scale hybrid filtration technology installed in its sinter plant. A total of €3m has been invested in the new technology, which has cut dust emissions significantly, to well below the EU limit of 20 mg\/Nm3. The company plans to install a second filter, so that both sinter plant stacks’ dust emissions are filtered.   The filter technology is the culmination of a major collaboration between Danish global engineering company FLSmidth and ArcelorMIttal’s R&D team, with a team of seven researchers and six technicians working on the design and testing stages of the project. It is to the credit of the teams involved that the project went from concept to industrialisation within two years.    ArcelorMittal signed a collaboration agreement with FLSmidth to build a pilot plant for the filter in Gijón, Spain, as well as to work together on adapting the technology – which was originally developed for cement plants – to work in sinter plants, which convert iron ore into sinter feed which is then used in the blast furnace.  In addition, ArcelorMittal is installing the technology in its operations in Dąbrowa Górnicza, Poland, while a third installation in Gent, Belgium, is also in progress.   Speaking about the filter innovation, Pinakin Chaubal, head of process R&D at ArcelorMittal, said:  “I’m extremely proud of the team involved in this project, which sets a new global standard for sinter plant emissions. The installation of the hybrid filter in ArcelorMittal Zenica is an important milestone in the project which has involved our R&D team, ArcelorMittal technical specialists, and ArcelorMittal sites in Bosnia & Herzegovina and Spain. I would also like to thank FLSmidth for their highly professional collaboration on this innovative development.”  New technology has also been introduced to achieve major reductions in smoke and gas emissions from ArcelorMittal Zenica’s coke battery. The smokeless charging car, a €4.2m investment, cuts charging times, delivering an almost smoke-free charging process and prevents CO2 emissions being released into the atmosphere. The technology was provided by the UK engineering firm John M. Henderson Machines.   A team of JMH Machines engineers supervised the testing of the mechanical, electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic systems on the ground level, before the 126-tonne car was lifted in one piece into position on the coke oven battery.  New product range  An investment of €5.2m has also been made, to make ArcelorMittal Zenica the first plant in ArcelorMittal Europe to produce rebar in coil.   This is one of ArcelorMittal Zenica’s most important products, which offers customers efficiencies in terms of cutting down on wastage and storage space, and annual production capacity will be raised from 300,000 to 320,000 tonnes, while introducing improvements in the product quality and range, ease of storage and delivery. Italy’s SMS Meer provided and installed the equipment for this production improvement.   “This will improve ArcelorMittal’s competitive edge in an important market sector,” said ArcelorMittal Zenica CEO Mr Biju Nair.   Speaking at the ceremony in Zenica, Mr Nair continued:  “The three important new investment programmes that we are announcing today represent another practical demonstration of our strong commitment to building a long term, sustainable future for steelmaking in this historic industrial city.   Mr Biju Nair addresses delegates at Friday's inauguration ceremony  “To be sustainable, we must pay attention to improving our environmental footprint, and the efficient production of high quality products that meet the expectations of our customers. The projects we’re announcing today are very important further steps towards both those objectives.”  Mr Nair re-affirmed ArcelorMittal Zenica’s strong commitment to continued improvements in its environmental performance, and emphasized the importance of the steel works to the economy of the city, the Canton and the whole region.       Mr Fadil Novolic, Prime Minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, sent a letter of support, as he was unable to attend the ceremony in person. “New investments in the corporate sector of Bosnia and Herzegovina bring prosperity to everyone, but you are the leader in this and you set an example for other investors in our country and the whole world”.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Zenica inaugurates world’s first hybrid filter, part of a €12.4m investment in environmental and steel production projects","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Zenica - one of the most important industrial companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the country’s top exporter – has officially inaugurated three new investment projects, with a combined value of more than €12.4m, at a ceremony on Friday 10 March attended by senior representatives from the Federal, Cantonal and City of Zenica authorities.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-mar-13-arcelormittal-zenica-inaugurates-world-s-first-hybrid-filter\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6353,"text":"The day’s activities, organised in partnership with the Museum of Metallurgy, included a tour of the plant’s facilities, exhibitions, presentations on several topics including electrical steels, industry trade, plant’s history, as well as an information stand set up by an engineering school to give insight into the applications of electrical steels.  The plant specialises in electrical steels for a number of industries, including energy (hydropower, wind, nuclear, etc.), industrial motors, consumer goods (household appliances and tools), and the automotive sector, supplying high-grade products for electric and hybrid vehicles. The plant supplies some 150 customers across the world, with 75% of the products exported, 25% out of Europe.  Investing in the future of the plant and the community  In 2013 the plant commissioned a new continuous annealing production line, an investment worth €90 million. Furthermore, in May this year, the company announced a new €5.6 million investment plan that should allow recovery and use of the heat generated in the production process. The project, done in collaboration with Kyotherm, Schneider Electric, and the town of Saint-Chély-d'Apcher, should enable the plant to save 4,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions per year, equivalent to taking 2,000 new vehicles off the road.   “We have been able to adopt a new course in recent years following the investment made in 2013. We are guided solely by our customers’ requirements and have become pioneers in Europe,\" said Gilles Hoffmann, ArcelorMittal Saint-Chély-d'Apcher plant director.   “This plant has a bright future ahead of it with the development of high-end steels for the automotive industry,” said Bernard Dehut, ArcelorMittal Méditerranée CEO.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Saint-Chély-d'Apcher celebrates a century of steelmaking excellence","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Saint-Chély-d'Apcher, France, celebrated 100 years of operations at an open day event held on 23 September and attended by more than 2,700 guests.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-sep-28-saint-chely-d-apcher-celebrates-a-century-of-steelmaking-excellence\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6361,"text":"By collaborating with internal experts, those from academia and its customers, ArcelorMittal is finding ways to make transformational changes to the way it does business, as it seeks to achieve its ambition of becoming a zero-waste company. Some of the ways it is doing this, acknowledged by the commendation, include:    * Partnering with technical and industry leaders to develop and scale up ground-breaking carbon capture and utilisation technology, resulting in products like Steelanol, a bio-fuel made from waste carbon monoxide, with the help of microbes. This high-grade ethanol will then be used for transportation and to make plastics. The company anticipates Steelanol could create 2000 direct and indirect jobs and generate an income of 300 million euro a year by 2025, while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions – 5 million tonnes worth a year by 2025.   * Manufacturing ECOCEM, a low carbon cement, from its slag and selling it directly to customers. In France alone, this practice has already reduced the cement industry’s CO2 emissions by nearly two million tonnes, and from 2018 onwards it is projected to further reduce those emissions by a further one million tonnes a year. Selling this by-product generates over 100 million euro in revenue each year.   * Paving more than 650 km of country roads across 20 Brazilian municipalities with over 1.5 million tonnes of Revsol and Revsol Plus. These products, made from slag, a by-product of the steelmaking process, replace natural non-renewable resources such as gravel.   * Allocating additional resources to detailed life cycle assessment of its products and developing a new sustainability assessment tool.   * Designing innovative processes and products to maximise efficiency and minimise waste in its own production and those of its customers.   * Stretching product lifecycles by leasing sheet piles for short term projects, rather than selling them – and then leasing them again. The company’s comparative studies show reusing sheet piles has 86% less global warming potential than permanent steel sheet piles and 90% less global warming potential than a concrete retaining wall.   Similarly, through the circular building, exhibited at the London Design Festival 2016, the company demonstrated the concept of steel reuse for entire steel structures, given they are designed, dismantled and reused with the circular economy in mind.   * Torrefing waste wood and using it to replace coal in its blast furnaces, harnessing and using energy that would otherwise have been lost. In doing so, the company expects to recycle two to four million tonnes of waste wood each year by 2025, saving it approximately 100 million euro a year.   * The Circulars 2018, an initiative of The World Economic Forum and The Forum of Young Global Leaders, run in collaboration with Accenture Strategy and given at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos. The award recognises individuals and organisations from around the world who are making notable contributions to the circular economy.    Alan Knight, General manager, head of corporate responsibility and sustainable development said, “Being highly commended by the Circulars 2018, is a fantastic achievement and highlights how far we have come as a steel company to change not only the way we do things, but also the way we are perceived as a corporate citizen. We have long talked about the value steel brings to people’s lives and its unparalleled recyclability, but now we are finding ways to take those ideas further and become a zero-waste company by integrating circular economy principles into everything we do.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2017-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal gets nod from World Economic Forum for integrating circular economy principles into its business model","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"The world’s most prestigious award programme for the circular economy, The Circulars, has highly commended ArcelorMittal for demonstrating leadership and innovation by applying circular economy principles to its business models.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2017-dec-7-arcelormittal-gets-nod-from-world-economic-forum\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The work will cost approximately CAD$6 million.     The investments were made possible in part by the Québec government’s electricity rebate programme for L-rate customers, announced by the Government of Quebec in the 2016-2017 Budget. This electricity rebate is intended for companies engaging in major investment projects in the manufacturing sector as well as in the transformation of natural resources. ArcelorMittal investment project rebate is currently estimated at CAD$25 million until 2020.   In addition to these announcements, ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada has also invested CAD$27 million in a new finishing line at its Longueuil mill, a project which was completed in June 2017. Past and future work requires support from many suppliers and subcontractors, mostly from local communities, which adds economic benefits.   François Perras, Chief Executive Officer, ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada, said:  “We are renewing ArcelorMittal’s commitment to Quebec. Our choice to invest in the acquisition of high-performance equipment will help us accelerate our move towards high-value-added steel production, particularly for the automotive and construction industries. ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada will also be in a better position to meet its customers’ needs and face international competition.

With this modernisation plan, we will continue to play a major role in our communities by supporting more than 1,700 direct jobs and converting our natural resources right here in Quebec.”   Dominique Anglade, Deputy Premier, Minister of Economy, Science and Innovation and Minister responsible for the digital strategy, said:  “The innovative manufacturing sector is one of the three economic pillars that our government is prioritising, along with entrepreneurship and exports. We are, therefore, proud to support the initiatives of large businesses established in Québec which, through major investments, are carrying out innovative projects and adopting new technologies in their manufacturing approaches and procedures. Innovation and modernisation are synonymous with growth for businesses and are key levers for Québec’s prosperity.”  Carlos J. Leitão, Minister of Finance, said:  “Québec’s stable business environment, recognised expertise in a number of leading-edge sectors and abundant natural resources make it the ideal place to invest. Today’s announcement clearly demonstrates ArcelorMittal’s interest in expanding its operations in Québec. The confirmation of these strategic investments will bolster and diversify our economy in several of Québec’s regions.”  Image: ArcelorMittal's wire rod mill in Contrecoeur, Quebec  Images for media use: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2DpiJh6  About ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada  ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada’s (http:\/\/long-canada.arcelormittal.com) mission is to safely manufacture sustainable steel in accordance with its values of health and safety, quality, leadership and sustainability.

{"id":6389,"text":"If proved successful, the new concept has the potential to revolutionise blast furnace carbon emissions capture and support the decarbonisation of the transport sector.  The technology in the gas conversion process was pioneered by Chicago-based company, LanzaTech, with whom ArcelorMittal has entered a long-term partnership. The technology licensed by LanzaTech uses microbes that feed on carbon monoxide to produce bioethanol. The bioethanol will be used as transport fuel or potentially in the production of plastics.  This is the first installation of its kind on an industrial scale in Europe and once complete, annual production of bioethanol at Ghent is expected to reach around 80 million litres, which will yield an annual CO2 saving equivalent to putting 100,000 electrical cars on the road. The new installation will create up to 500 construction jobs over the next two years and 20 to 30 new permanent direct jobs. Commissioning and first production is expected by mid-2020.  The application of this microbial gas conversion system significantly advances ArcelorMittal’s carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) capabilities and enhances steel’s role in the circular economy. ArcelorMittal’s long-term aspiration is to become a zero-waste business, with all materials used or generated during steel production recuperated, treated and reused in the production chain or becoming the raw materials for other industries.  \"This new Carbon Smart technology illustrates ArcelorMittal’s commitment to transforming steel production and it will also further strengthen steel’s standing in the circular economy, particularly compared to other higher carbon metals like aluminium.”  \"We are excited that after several years of research and engineering, we are now progressing with the largest project of its kind within the ArcelorMittal group. This is the first application of a viable new business case where re-use of carbon is possible at large scale.

{"id":6433,"text":"This year, the Group intends to launch a new project in the ArcelorMittal plant in Hamburg to use hydrogen on an industrial scale for the direct reduction of iron ore in the steel production process for the first time. A pilot plant is to be built in the coming years.  Already today, the Hamburg plant has one of the most efficient production processes of the ArcelorMittal Group due to the use of natural gas in a direct reduction plant (DRI). The aim of the new hydrogen-based process is to be able to produce steel with the lowest CO2 emissions. The project costs amount to around 65 million euros. In addition, a cooperation agreement with the University of Freiberg is planned to test the procedure in the coming years at the Hamburg plant premises.   \"Our Hamburg site offers optimum conditions for this innovative project: an electric arc furnace with DRI system and iron ore pellets stockyard as well as decades of know-how in this area. The use of hydrogen as a reducing agent shall now be tested in a new shaft furnace,\" comments Frank Schulz, CEO of ArcelorMittal Germany.  The hydrogen-based reduction of iron ore will initially take place on a demonstration scale with an annual production of 100,000 tonnes.  In the process, the separation of H2 with a purity of more than 95 percent from the top gas of the existing plant should be achieved by so-called pressure swing adsorption. The process is first tested with grey hydrogen (generated at gas separation) to allow for economical operation. In the future, the plant should also be able to run on green hydrogen (generated from renewable sources) when it is available in sufficient quantities.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"World first for steel: ArcelorMittal investigates the industrial use of pure hydrogen","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Cologne, March 28, 2019 - To permanently reduce CO2 emissions, ArcelorMittal has developed a low-emissions technology strategy, which targets not only the use of alternative feedstocks and the conversion of CO2 emissions, but also the direct avoidance of carbon (Carbon Direct Avoidance, or CDA).","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-mar-28-world-first-for-steel\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

Key highlights include:    * Transition opportunities – ArcelorMittal is ranked first for investing in a suite of radical and transformative technologies including Carbon2value, SIDERWIN, IGAR and Torero with significant decarbonisation potential.   * Data transparency – ArcelorMittal is ranked first for having the most comprehensive emissions and energy disclosures of its peer group, reporting emissions according to Worldsteel’s guidelines   * Low carbon innovations – ArcelorMittal is ranked first for pioneering a number of breakthrough technologies such as the SIDERWIN project to produce iron ore via electrolysis. The report also highlights our $65 million investment on an industrial scale DRI hydrogen-based plant in Hamburg.   * Renewable energy use – ArcelorMittal is ranked first with a number of renewable assets including 75MWe solar capacity, for multiple PPAs to acquire solar and wind power and for actively exploring the potential for further PPAs to supply its steel plants.   * Board and executive climate management – ArcelorMittal ranked first and recognised for having a sustainability committee at a board level overseeing the company’s sustainability issues and low-carbon transition strategies.   * Climate governance and strategy – ArcelorMittal is ranked second and is recognised for our ambition to be carbon neutral in its Europe operations by 2050 and for officially supporting the TCFD and other climate initiatives in the industry.    Alan Knight, Corporate Responsibility General Manager, at ArcelorMittal, says: “While steel has a lower carbon intensity that many other materials, the large volumes produced globally mean that the industry emits more than three gigatons of CO2 annually. With the demand for steel ever increasing, we know we have a role to play and a clear responsibility to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of steel.”  Knight says: “We’re very pleased that the CDP League Tables have recognised our efforts, with our ranking going up from fifth to second place. We are trialling new technologies in our steel plants, making significant investments in R&D and working with our customers to provide the most sustainable products.”  Knight continues “We know that there is more work to be done to achieve our ambition of being carbon neutral in Europe by 2050, and to significantly reduce our carbon emissions worldwide. Working with stakeholders to create supportive policies to ensure a global level playing field, access to renewable energy at affordable process and access to finance will be critical in achieving greater impact.”  ArcelorMittal recently published its first Climate Action report in which it announced its ambition to significantly reduce CO2emissions globally and be carbon neutral in Europe by 2050. To achieve this goal the company is building a strategic roadmap linked to the evolution of public policy and developments in low-emissions steelmaking technologies.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2019-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal ranked best steel company for low carbon innovations","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal has been ranked first in the world in five categories relating to steel companies’ readiness for a low carbon transition.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/2019-jul-31-arcelormittal-ranked-best-steel-company-for-low-carbon-innovations\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6464,"text":"Both companies have now signed a Framework Collaboration Agreement (FCA) to cooperate on several projects, ranging from research and development to the implementation of new technologies. The FCA will be governed by a number of Project Development Agreements, incorporating the expertise of Midrex and ArcelorMittal. The first Project Development Agreement is to demonstrate in Hamburg the large-scale production and use of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) made with 100% hydrogen as the reductant.   In the coming years, the demonstration plant will produce about 100,000 tons of direct reduced iron per year - initially with grey hydrogen sourced from natural gas. Conversion to green hydrogen from renewable energy sources will take place once available in sufficient quantities and at an economical cost. Energy for hydrogen production could come from wind farms off the coast of Northern Germany. The plant will be the world’s first direct reduction plant on an industrial scale, powered by hydrogen.  \"We are working with a world class provider, Midrex Technologies, to learn how you can produce virgin iron for steelmaking at a large scale by only using hydrogen. This project combined with our ongoing projects on the use of non-fossil carbon and on carbon capture and use is key to become carbon neutral in Europe in 2050. Large scale demonstrations are critical to show our ambition. However it will depend on the political conditions, how fast transformation will take place\", comments Carl de Maré, Vice President at ArcelorMittal and responsible for technology strategy.       ArcelorMittal Hamburg already produces steel using DRI technology. During the process, iron oxide pellets are reduced to metallic iron, the raw material for high quality steel, by extracting oxygen using natural gas. \"Our site is the most energy-efficient production plant at ArcelorMittal\", says Dr Uwe Braun, CEO at ArcelorMittal Hamburg, adding that the existing Midrex plant in Hamburg is also the plant with the lowest CO2-emissions for high quality steel production in Europe. \"With the new, hydrogen-based DRI plant we are now planning, we will raise steel production to a completely new level, as part of our Europe-wide ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050\", Dr Braun concludes.  \"This commercial scale project will show the path for hydrogen based iron and steel making\", commented Stephen C.

{"id":6465,"text":"Installed by Eneco, this is their largest project to date. The project will help ArcelorMittal Belgium in becoming more sustainable as the power generated will be used internally by ArcelorMittal in Ghent. More than 5,000 employees are also given the opportunity to co-invest in the solar panels and benefit from the revenues.  Eneco -the largest solar energy producer in Belgium- has installed a 7.5 million euros solar roof at ArcelorMittal in Ghent. The park consists of 27,104 solar panels for which 157.2 tons of steel was used. The total weight of the installation amounts to 1.5 million kilos. This means that ArcelorMittal now owns the fourth largest solar park in Belgium and the largest solar roof in Belgium.  Reinforce sustainability strategy  The new solar panels will produce 10.000MWh annually, equal to the energy consumption of 2,900 households. The solar panels, together with the site’s (current) 10 wind turbines and the 2 additionally planned wind turbines, will soon provide approximately 50MW of renewable power to the Ghent site. The sustainable energy that is generated is used entirely internally to feed the production of ArcelorMittal in Ghent.  Today, ArcelorMittal Belgium is a world-leader in energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. With this investment, the company reinforces the implementation of its sustainability strategy. ArcelorMittal Belgium follows the climate agreement of Paris. The site’s emissions are already 25% lower than in 1990, which is 20% better than what the Paris climate agreement demands. By 2027, ArcelorMittal Belgium aims to produce 43% fewer emissions, with the ambition of being carbon neutral by 2050.*  “The renewable energy generated by these 27,104 solar panels supports us in achieving our ambition to be climate-neutral by 2050. We’re fully committed to this ambition and excited to launch Belgium’s largest solar roof. Alongside our soon to be installed additional wind- turbines, we’re again taking steps in the right direction. In addition, the new solar panels are also a good example of the importance of steel in our daily lives. The panels are fixed on a framework made of steel coated with Magnelis®. The Magnelis® steel, produced at our production site in Liège among others, is a strong illustration of sustainability. It guarantees the long-term viability of each solar park, regardless of the environment in which it is located. Steel clearly is a sustainable product for a more sustainable future.” Manfred Van Vlierberghe, CEO ArcelorMittal Belgium.  More than 5,000 employees have the chance to co-invest in solar panels  The 5,800 employees of ArcelorMittal Belgium who work at the sites in Ghent, Genk, Geel and Liège have the opportunity to invest in the solar panels and to benefit from the revenues. They are offered this opportunity by means of crowdlending, a loan whereby the collaborators lend money to Eneco for a period of six years. They receive a guaranteed gross return of 4 percent for their investment. Each employee can invest between 250 euros and 1000 euros to ArcelorMittal Belgium for the solar roof.  “If you, for example, lend 500 euros, you will earn an extra 20 euros a year. In six years’ time, the employee earns 120 euros. After the term, (s)he will recover the original investment of 500 euros as well. Through crowdlending, we want to actively involve the employees in this sustainable project. By doing so, we hope to raise their awareness about the importance of sustainable energy and reward them for their efforts. We are therefore delighted that a major industrial player such as ArcelorMittal Belgium is reflecting on its energy consumption and is actively contributing to making a greener future possible for future generations”. Iwein Goigne, CEO Eneco Solar Belgium.  For Eneco, this is the second project, after Volvo Car Gent, in which employees can participate by means of crowdlending.  Fast growing energy vision within Ghent industry  The initiative of ArcelorMittal Belgium and Eneco is in line with the Flemish Government’s Energy Vision for 2021 – 2030. This Energy Vision states that energy consumption must be significantly reduced and that the industry must be 10% more energy efficient by 2030.  “Large renewable energy projects such as those at ArcelorMittal Belgium are necessary in order to put in place a real energy transition. It makes a big difference to a company’s energy bill, but also to the achievement of the renewable energy targets in Flanders. Many companies in the Ghent port area realize that this change of our mindsets is crucial and we are therefore pleased to see that the concrete implementation of the Energy Vision is being taken seriously.” Lydia Peeters, Flemish Deputy Prime Minister and Flemish Minister of Finance, Budget, Energy & Culture.  “I am pleased that ArcelorMittal continues to focus on the reduction of CO2 reduction and energy efficiency. The investment in this new solar park is one of their projects to achieve the ultimate goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050. In this way, our industry is working towards a sustainable and climate-neutral society.” Koen van den Heuvel, Flemish Minister of the Environment, Nature and Agriculture  “The city of Ghent and the North Sea Port are committed to renewable energy, CO2 reduction and reuse. By installing solar panels and solar parks in the cross-border port area, like at ArcelorMittal in Ghent, the port companies are generating renewable energy which is injected into the electricity grid, accounting for the equivalent of more than 31,000 households. In this way, our port is increasingly becoming a sustainable Energy Port, and together with all port companies, we are building a climate-neutral city by 2050.” Mathias De Clercq, mayor of the city of Ghent  ArcelorMittal Belgium continues to work on similar projects at its sites in Liège, Genk and Geel.

{"id":6508,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’), the world’s leading steel and mining company, has today published its 2019 integrated annual review, ‘Inventing smarter steels for a better world’. The review, which can be accessed at https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/corporate-library\/reporting-hub\/integrated-annual-review-2019, underpins the Company’s commitment to transparent reporting. It has been produced in-line with the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework and demonstrates the Company’s approach to ensuring it brings long-term, sustainable value to its broad stakeholder base.  The review provides an overview of the progress the Company made in 2019 and outlines how it is addressing its challenges. Specifically, the review details how ArcelorMittal performed last year across four distinct areas, namely: health and safety performance; delivering financial value; innovating smarter steels and solutions; and driving environmental and social sustainability.  Commenting, Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “I am fundamentally optimistic about the long-term outlook for steel because, as the world’s population further increases and living standards continue to improve for everyone, demand for materials will also increase. Our product is also an integral component in much of the infrastructure that will support a net zero carbon economy, including wind and solar farms, electric vehicles and low-carbon buildings. But we also need to work to significantly reduce our direct carbon footprint. Beyond the challenge of trialling and scaling up potential technologies, the biggest hurdle will be the significantly higher costs which cannot be supported by the profitability of the industry alone. This is why policy intervention is so critical, both to provide access to finance as well as to ensure a level playing field.  “As steelmaking develops, it is important to also develop the skills of our employees and to ensure we can retain and attract the people we need for continued success. We have already strengthened our digitalisation teams and are also boosting our research and development teams with 3D printing experts as we explore the potential for printing steel from steel powders. We believe the steel industry offers interesting and complex challenges, and ArcelorMittal an entrepreneurial, global environment in which to grow and prosper.  “Undoubtedly there will be significant COVID-19 repercussions for some time to come. But I do expect the fundamentals to reassert themselves, for the world to continue with its development, to continue to grow, to continue to want to give a better quality of life to more people, and to continue to prioritise sustainability. There will be challenges, as there are always challenges, but steel has a critical role to play in the world of the future as it has in the world of the past. And I am sure ArcelorMittal, as the world’s leading and only global steel company, will continue to be a material supplier of choice, inventing smarter steels for the better world we all hope to see.”  Key highlights of ArcelorMittal’s sustainable development approach and progress discussed in the review include:    * The steps the Company is taking to address its carbon challenge, encapsulated in our commitment to supporting the objectives of the Paris Agreement, and our ambition to significantly reduce emissions across the group, including a 30% reduction in carbon emissions in Europe by 2030, and carbon neutrality in Europe by 2050.         * An overview of the first full year of Steligence®, our radical new concept for the use of steel in construction. This facilitates the next generation of high-performance buildings and sustainable construction techniques. It is already proving highly successful, having delivered 16 million m2 of building and nearly 500,000 tonnes of steel so far.         * The importance the Company places on R&D, insight into how our $301 million R&D budget was allocated in 2019 and a spotlight on our work with Canoo to create a disruptive new vehicle for a world in which transportation is becoming increasingly electric, shared and autonomous.         * How, in 2019, we avoided the emission of more than 11 million tonnes CO2 in the cement industry through the sale of 15 million tonnes of blast furnace slag for use as cement – 19% more than in 2018. In 2019, our absolute CO2e footprint for our steel and mining operations saw a 4% decrease against 2018, and for our steel operations, a 4.5% decrease.         * We are reducing our direct emissions from energy consumption. In 2019, 44% of our electricity was generated from renewable sources and through onsite generation.     * A summary of value creation for stakeholders in 2019, in the Company’s value creation model.

{"id":6510,"text":"* Europe’s largest steelmaker, unveils breakthrough technologies that will take the company to 30% lower CO2 emissions by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 2050     * ArcelorMittal Europe is investing in two routes to carbon neutrality, Smart Carbon and an innovative DRI-based route, in recognition of the need to act now to reduce CO2 emissions, in line with the EU’s Green Deal and the Paris Agreement   * Calls for new policy framework, to support the industry in its transition to carbon neutrality, naming five market conditions that are needed for Europe’s steelmakers to compete globally     ArcelorMittal Europe has announced details of how it plans to become carbon neutral by 2050 in its first climate action report, published today. Building on the company’s work that has demonstrated that the steelmaking process can become carbon neutral, the report publishes details of the ground-breaking work underway to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030 before reaching net zero in 2050.  The company is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral routes for steelmaking: Smart Carbon, and an innovative DRI-based route.  Smart Carbon is a carbon-neutral steelmaking route that leverages all clean energies – circular carbon, clean electricity and carbon capture and storage (CCS) - within the high temperature-controlled reduction environment of ironmaking. In its first phase, Smart Carbon will primarily use circular carbon.  Reaching carbon-neutral steelmaking via DRI involves moving from using predominantly natural gas, to hydrogen as the key reductant in ironmaking. As this hydrogen becomes ‘green’, the steelmaking process comes close to carbon neutrality.  While both the Smart Carbon route and the DRI-based route have the potential to deliver carbon -neutral steel by 2050, the important difference between the two routes is that Smart Carbon can deliver results sooner, through its use of complementary technologies which enable incremental progress. Uniquely, Smart Carbon has the potential not only to provide carbon-neutral steel, but also carbon-neutral cement, and the building blocks to make recycled carbon materials to replace polyethylene-based plastics. Smart Carbon can also contribute to CO2 removal, through the increased use of circular carbon, using sustainable biomass and waste, combined with scaling up CCS.  By investing in both routes – and in recognition of the need to act now to combat climate change - this means ArcelorMittal Europe can significantly reduce scope 1 CO2 emissions* – which include all process emissions - by 2030 over a 2018 baseline, while waiting for the large-scale, affordable renewable energy needed for hydrogen-based steelmaking.  ArcelorMittal Europe’s 2030 target therefore combines Smart Carbon technologies and increased scrap usage, specifically by developing new ways to increase the use of low-quality scrap metal – which is hard to recycle - in the primary steel production process.  In the longer-term, both routes have the potential to leverage all three clean energies to achieve carbon neutrality, namely:    * clean electricity (generated by sources such as solar and wind),   * circular carbon (making use of biowaste materials, such as sustainable forestry and agriculture residues, to produce bioenergy)   * carbon capture and storage (capturing CO2 before it is emitted, transporting it and storing it safely underground).    Commenting on the report, Aditya Mittal, President and CFO, ArcelorMittal, and CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said:  “Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing us all. Understandably, much attention is currently focussed on navigating the unexpected and unprecedented outbreak of Covid-19. However, climate change remains a huge long-term challenge that will require diligent attention and progress for decades to come. And like Covid-19, it is not something that one country or one company can solve alone. Carbon emissions also know no border, so it will take a global effort, with all nations and companies playing their part.  “ArcelorMittal Europe is doing a lot of work to develop a path to net zero. The technologies we are working on have the potential to make a big impact. Indeed, steel should and can play a leading role in achieving the vision for Europe as outlined in the Green Deal. Our research and development team are one of the best in the industry and relish solving complex problems. But it needs a team effort. The support the EU and member states can give to ensure we have well-designed policy to make large-scale, competitive, carbon-neutral steelmaking a reality, is critical.”  ArcelorMittal Europe has industrial-scale demonstration projects under construction for every part of its carbon-neutral roadmap. The company is building industrial-scale demonstration plants at its operations in Belgium (Carbalyst® and Torero), France (3D and IGAR in Dunkirk). In Hamburg, Germany, we are in the design and funding phase prior to the investment decision, of an industrial-scale project to use hydrogen instead of natural gas in the direct reduction of iron ore (DRI). These demonstration plants will allow the company to scale-up technologies that will be used in the Smart Carbon and DRI-based routes. The progress made has also been possible thanks to financial support from EU member states and European Union funding. ArcelorMittal Europe is now in the process of applying for funding for a further six projects.   While some of the technologies that feature in ArcelorMittal Europe’s roadmap will be ready for commercial-scale use by 2025, and by 2030 many of the Smart Carbon technologies can be mature and partially deployed across our facilities in Europe, the report also highlights the need for the right policy framework to enable European steelmaking to contribute to the EU’s climate targets, particularly given the costs involved. In total, the estimated investment needed for ArcelorMittal Europe to fully implement Smart Carbon is €15-25bn and €30-40bn for the DRI-based route. An additional €15–200bn would be required for the associated clean energy infrastructure (see report for more detail).  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, explained:  “I am proud of the work that has brought us this far in our efforts to create Europe’s first and largest carbon-neutral steelmaker. Our progress would not have been possible without the many partners we have on our Smart Carbon and innovative DRI projects. Today, the biggest barrier to transitioning to carbon-neutral steel, beyond the necessary technologies reaching commercial maturity, is the absence of the right market conditions. The financial costs of realising carbon-neutral steelmaking are undeniably huge. However, with a shift in market conditions brought about by having the right policies in place, European steelmakers will be able to unlock the means to reduce emissions from steel globally, while also ensuring the European steel industry remains competitive.”  The medium-term market conditions needed include:    1. Creating an environment where carbon-neutral steel is more competitive than steel which is not carbon neutral         2. A fair competitive landscape that accounts for the global nature of the steel market, addressing domestic, import and export steel dynamics, as well as the distinction between primary and secondary sources to make steel.         3. Access to sustainable finance, to innovate and make long-term investments.         4. Access to abundant, affordable clean energy: the scale of the steel industry’s energy needs are such that concerted cross-sector and government efforts will be required to develop the necessary clean energy infrastructure.         5. Public instruments to accelerate innovative technology deployment to transition to carbon neutral steelmaking.    The report also reiterates the company’s position that a Carbon Border Adjustment should be introduced in the European Union, which would ensure that EU-produced steel and imported steel tonnes in direct competition would have an equal carbon cost, creating a fair market and, crucially, encouraging investment in lower-emissions steel production.  ArcelorMittal Europe announced its target to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, in December 2019, and its ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050, in June 2019.  The ArcelorMittal group will publish its 2030 target later this year.   *ArcelorMittal Europe 30% CO2 reduction target includes: ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products, and Industeel  To read the report and view a short film about our roadmap, visit https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/sustainability\/climate-action-in-europe  To view our Carbon Border Adjustment animation, ‘Creating a low-carbon world, the case for a Carbon Border Adjustment’ visit https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T-iJeVoa7w0","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe sets out path to net zero by 2050, with pioneering technologies at the forefront of the company’s roadmap for carbon-neutral steelmaking","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe sets out path to net zero by 2050, with pioneering technologies at the forefront of the company’s roadmap for carbon-neutral steelmaking","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-sets-out-path-to-net-zero-by-2050-with-pioneering-technologies-at-the-forefront-of-the-company-s-roadmap-for-carbon-neutral-steelmaking\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6521,"text":"Commenting on the 2050 net zero target, before speaking about the challenge of decarbonising the steel industry at the Financial Times Commodities Conference today, Aditya Mittal, President and CFO, said:   “If the world is to achieve net zero by 2050 it will require all parts of the economy in all regions of the world to contribute. As the world’s leading steel company, we believe we have a responsibility to lead the efforts to decarbonise the steel-making process, which today has a significant carbon footprint.   “Steel will remain a vital material for our world and indeed is the most circular of all materials. Our challenge is to be able to make steel using clean energy technologies* on a commercial scale, while remaining competitive in the global steel industry.  “We are working on various pilot technologies which have excellent potential. In Hamburg, where we own and operate Europe’s only DRI-EAF facility, we will test not only the ability of hydrogen to reduce the iron-ore and form DRI, but also then test that carbon-free DRI in the EAF in the actual steel-making process.  “Hydrogen has a lot of potential but given the significant transition cost, we also believe in working on solutions for the traditional integrated route. This essentially follows the bio-energy, carbon capture and utilisation and storage route, which as stressed by both the IPCC and the IEA will be critical to achieving net zero by 2050. What is also interesting about this route is that it has the potential not only to provide carbon neutral steel, but also other products that will help the chemical industry make plastics in a carbon neutral way.   “Critical to turning the target into reality will be policy to enable steel to remain competitive while decarbonizing – particularly given every region of the world is moving at a different pace. We intend to actively engage with governments to chart a way forward that enables the steel industry to make meaningful progress through carefully designed policy that protects against carbon leakage.”  ArcelorMittal has identified two low-emissions steelmaking routes, both of which have the potential to lead to carbon-neutral steelmaking:    * The Hydrogen-DRI route, which uses hydrogen as a reducing agent. A demonstration plant in Hamburg, where ArcelorMittal owns Europe’s only operational DRI-EAF plant, is currently planned with a targeted start-up in 2023.     * The Smart Carbon route is centred around modifying the blast furnace route to create carbon neutral steelmaking through the use of circular carbon - in the form of sustainable biomass or carbon containing waste streams - and carbon capture and use (CCU) and storage (CCS). ArcelorMittal is well advanced on constructing several commercial-scale projects to test and prove a range of Smart Carbon technologies. Start-up target for key projects is targeted in 2022.    While both routes have the potential to deliver carbon-neutral steel by 2050, we believe that Smart Carbon can deliver results sooner, and make a meaningful contribution to CO2 emissions reduction this decade, while industrial scale production from the Hydrogen-DRI route is unlikely to be significant before 2030 due to the current high costs.  The Company has also previously outlined the policy framework environment it believes is required for carbon-neutral steelmaking to become a reality, which includes:    1. A global level playing field which avoids the risk of carbon leakage through mechanisms such as green border adjustments   2. Access to abundant and affordable clean energy   3. Policies which support the development of the necessary clean energy infrastructure   4. Access to sustainable finance for low-emissions steelmaking, and   5. Policies which accelerate the transition to a circular economy.    ArcelorMittal will set out further detail in support of its 2050 net zero target in its second climate action report, which is anticipated to be published before the end of 2020.  ArcelorMittal is a member of the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) and is an active member of the ETC’s Net Zero Steel Initiative underway in partnership with the World Economic Forum. ArcelorMittal is also actively engaged with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) to define an achievable SBT for the steel industry taking into account the two distinct routes in operation today.  *In its Climate Action Report and Europe Climate Action Report, ArcelorMittal refers to three clean energy vectors: clean electricity, circular carbon, and CCS.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal sets 2050 group carbon emissions target of net zero ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces a group-wide commitment to being carbon neutral by 2050, building on the commitment made in 2019 for its European business to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030, and be carbon neutral by 2050.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-sets-2050-group-carbon-emissions-target-of-net-zero\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6523,"text":"ArcelorMittal Europe today announces details of the CO2 technology strategy that will enable it to offer its first green steel solutions to customers this year (30,000 tonnes), scale up this offering in coming years (to reach 120,000 tonnes in 2021 and 600,000 tonnes by 2022), deliver its 30% CO2 emissions target by 2030, and achieve net zero by 2050.  The strategy is centred around two main technology routes, as introduced in the first ArcelorMittal Europe climate action report published earlier this year:    * The use of hydrogen in DRI-EAF and, also, the blast furnace   * The expansion of its Smart Carbon route, also utilising hydrogen    HYDROGEN  Hydrogen plays a central role in the company’s decarbonisation strategy. ArcelorMittal Europe is developing a series of industrial-scale hydrogen projects for use in blast furnace-based steelmaking that will start to deliver substantial CO2 emissions savings even within the next five years, as well as progressing a project to test the ability of hydrogen to reduce iron ore and form DRI on an industrial scale.   Ultimately to reach zero, this hydrogen will need to be ‘green’ (produced via electrolysis which is powered by renewable electricity). ArcelorMittal is therefore developing new facilities to produce green hydrogen using electrolysers. Teams at ArcelorMittal Bremen in Germany are working on the first large-scale deployment of this technology which can then be deployed in both the blast furnace and the DRI-EAF route. Previously, this emerging technology has only been tested at small pilot plants in Europe.  1\\. Hydrogen and the blast furnace    * ArcelorMittal Bremen    By installing an electrolyser, hydrogen can be produced and injected in large volumes into the blast furnace tuyeres. The project will reduce the volumes of coal needed in the iron ore reduction process, thereby cutting CO2 emissions.    * IGAR in Dunkirk    At ArcelorMittal Dunkirk, the company is developing a hybrid blast furnace process, which involves using DRI gas injection technology in the blast furnace shaft as well as using gas injection in the blast furnace tuyeres, using plasma technology to create a reducing gas. This is the first large-scale implementation of what is essentially a hybrid BF\/DRI technology. In due course it will enable green hydrogen to be injected into the blast furnace as it becomes available.     * Blast furnace injection across Flat Products sites     ArcelorMittal Europe is also implementing projects in almost all its Flat Products sites to use gases from different sources for blast furnace injection. Injecting hydrogen-rich coke oven gas is an efficient, cost effective method that allows steelmakers to reduce CO2 emissions now. ArcelorMittal Asturias has the most advanced coke oven gas project, with injection of grey hydrogen (hydrogen that has been recovered from gases including natural gas and coke oven gas) due to start in early 2021.  2\\. Hydrogen and DRI-EAF    * Testing hydrogen to reduce iron ore and form DRI, at ArcelorMittal Hamburg    ArcelorMittal Europe owns Europe’s only DRI-EAF facility in Hamburg, where a project is planned to test the ability of hydrogen to reduce iron ore and form DRI on an industrial scale, as well as testing carbon-free DRI in the EAF steelmaking process.    * Large-scale DRI plant being studied for Dunkirk    At ArcelorMittal Dunkirk a study has been launched to build a large-scale DRI plant, combined with an electric arc furnace. Initially, the DRI installation would use natural gas but ArcelorMittal’s unique experience in DRI production, together with the results of the DRI-hydrogen project in Hamburg mean the DRI installation will be fully ‘hydrogen-ready’.  SMART CARBON WITH HYDROGEN    * Second Carbalyst plant planned, in Fos-sur-Mer; further CO2 cuts with large electrolyser for hydrogen injection    ArcelorMittal is also planning to expand its use of the Smart Carbon technology route. At ArcelorMittal Fos-sur-Mer, France, a study is underway in collaboration with partner Lanzatech, to build a second Carbalyst plant in addition to the one under construction at ArcelorMittal Ghent in Belgium. This involves carbon capture from the blast furnace waste gas, and biologically converting it into ethanol for use as a biofuel or recycled carbon feedstock for the chemical industry. In parallel with the company’s electrolyser project in Bremen, the Carbalyst plant in Fos-sur-Mer will boost CO2 savings through hydrogen injection, supplied by a large-scale electrolyser that will produce the hydrogen locally from renewable electricity.  First verified green steel for customers  The first impact of these decarbonisation efforts means ArcelorMittal Europe will be offering customers green steel products this year, when the first 30,000 tonnes will be ready.  A system that quantifies the CO2 emissions savings made thanks to the decarbonisation projects being rolled out by ArcelorMittal Europe has been developed. Customers will be able to buy green steel, based on verified emissions compared with a 2018 baseline.   Innovation Fund submissions  To fund the capital investment needed for the projects announced today, ArcelorMittal Europe is preparing funding applications to the EU’s Innovation Fund which is designed to support low-carbon investments in the European Union.   Aditya Mittal, President and CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said:   \"Today we are providing an important update on our progress in achieving our target of reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, including the vital role that hydrogen has in our strategy. Our talented teams across ArcelorMittal Europe are working hard to ensure our CO2 emissions reduction projects deliver results as fast as possible, on an industrial scale. We are focussed on being ready for the hydrogen economy and the exciting opportunities this presents for us as European steelmakers.   “In parallel we continue to roll out our Smart Carbon technology which we are convinced also offers huge potential given the world will need so-called BECCS technologies (bio-energy, carbon capture and storage) to reach net zero by 2050.   “Our plans to offer greener and more circular steel will support our customers in their circular economy objectives. We are pleased to be able to offer our first green tonnes this year and look forward to being able to provide customers with larger volumes of this steel as our decarbonisation projects are ramped up and rolled out across Europe.  “We are in the process of applying for funding for various projects from the ETS Innovation Fund which we hope will be successful, giving us the vital access to finance that we need for these important projects. The success of these projects will also be secured through partnerships, and we would like to thank our partners for their hard work and willingness to co-develop the new technologies we need to make carbon-neutral steel.”  ArcelorMittal Europe climate action report  In June 2020, ArcelorMittal Europe published its first climate action report which outlined the company’s strategy for reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.  In the report the company identified two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology routes, Smart Carbon and innovative DRI based on hydrogen, that will help the company reach its CO2 reduction targets.

ArcelorMittal Rodange specializes in the production of grooved rails, supplying major rail projects around the world.  The two companies will cooperate on engineering, business models and financing, and aim to have the Rodange biogas plant operational in 2023. The biogas will be made using Vow’s patented ‘Biogreen’ pyrolysis technology, which involves heating sustainable biomass at high temperatures. The gases emitted during this process are then captured and processed into biogas, which will directly replace the use of natural gas in the Rodange plant’s rolling mill reheating furnace. By-products such as bio-coal will also be created during the process, and re-used within ArcelorMittal, directly replacing the use of coal.  The Rodange biogas plant will be ETIA’s first industrial-scale pilot project for this specific application, and the intention is for similar plants to be built in Europe, thereby increasing the CO2 emissions saved from replacing the use of natural gas.  “We are very pleased to be working with VOW ASA, combining our expertise as steelmakers with Vow and ETIA technology, to create this biogas plant for ArcelorMittal Rodange.

{"id":6543,"text":"ArcelorMittal Asturias has completed its coke-oven gas injection project for Blast Furnace B in its Gijón plant, a strategic step to reduce CO2 emissions and operational costs, thanks to lower coke consumption.  ArcelorMittal Europe has a target to reduce its CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, and an ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050. To achieve this target, ArcelorMittal Europe has two main technological pathways, innovative DRI and Smart Carbon, which were presented in the company’s first Climate Action Report, published in June 2020. Innovative DRI involves the use of hydrogen for the direct reduction of iron ore (to produce direct reduced iron, DRI), for use in both electric arc furnaces and blast furnaces. Smart Carbon is a carbon-neutral steel production path that makes use of all clean energies (circular carbon, clean electricity and carbon capture and storage (CCS)) in a controlled high-temperature reduction environment for the production of hot metal. In the first stage, the Smart Carbon path will basically use circular carbon, expanding to become hydrogen Smart Carbon when green hydrogen is widely available and affordable.  The Smart Carbon approach, as applied in the projects that the Company is working on at its European Flat Products sites, allows gases from various sources to be injected into the blast furnace. The injection of coke-oven gas, with high hydrogen content, is an effective and cost-efficient method that enables steel producers to reduce CO2 emissions immediately.

Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal have signed an MoU that aims to contribute significantly to the decarbonization of the Dunkirk industrial basin. In the context of the Paris Agreement and the European Commission’s Green Deal, and in line with Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal’s commitments to energy transition, the project will reduce yearly CO2 emissions from ArcelorMittal’s steel-making facilities in Dunkirk by 2.85 Mt by 2030. Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal have jointly applied for large projects funding under the Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) scheme for hydrogen. Funding from European and\/or French schemes supporting decarbonization is key to the implementation of the project.  ArcelorMittal is ready to implement an innovative production unit on its Dunkirk site, combining two steel production technologies – DRI: direct reduced iron unit, and submerged arc furnace – in dimensions never seen before. As a low-carbon technology, the DRI and submerged arc furnace unit will enable the production of steel with lower CO2 emissions. This initiative was the subject of a preliminary study announced by ArcelorMittal last October. It comes in addition to the initiatives already implemented by ArcelorMittal on its Dunkirk site to lower its CO2 emissions.  Air Liquide will support this strategic initiative through the massive supply of low-carbon hydrogen and the implementation of CO2 capture technologies in Dunkirk, one of Air Liquide's historical industrial basins in France.

At ArcelorMittal, we have an important role to play in helping society deliver the objectives of the Paris Agreement and are determined to lead our industry’s transition to carbon neutral steel.  “We have the scale, resources and technological prowess to make a significant impact, and have already identified the routes to carbon neutral steelmaking through our Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI pathways.  “Our launch of XCarb™ today brings the full breadth of our decarbonisation activity together under a single umbrella brand. It aims to demonstrate to stakeholders the diverse range of initiatives we are undertaking in pursuit of our 2050 net zero goal while also providing our customers with solutions which help them address their own carbon reduction targets, demonstrating the important role steel has to play in a future, circular economy.”   The first XCarb™ initiatives to be launched are as follows:  ‘XCarb™ green steel certificates’  Across our ArcelorMittal Europe - Flat Products operations, we are investing in a broad range of initiatives to reduce carbon emissions from the blast furnace. These initiatives range from our flagship Smart Carbon projects, such as Torero (transforming biomass into bio-coal to replace the use of coal in the blast furnace) and Carbalyst (capturing carbon-rich blast furnace waste gas and converting it into bio-ethanol, which can then be used to make low-carbon chemical products) to capturing hydrogen-rich waste gases from the steelmaking process and injecting them into the blast furnace to reduce coal use.  These effort-intensive investments result in considerable CO2 savings, which can be passed onto customers in the form of the steel industry’s first-ever certification scheme. CO2 savings are aggregated, independently assured, and then converted into XCarb™ green steel certificates using a conversion factor that represents the average CO2 intensity of integrated steelmaking in Europe. The scheme therefore provides customers with the opportunity to buy certificates attached to their physical orders of steel, enabling them to report a reduction in their Scope 3 carbon emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The company anticipates it will have 600,000 tonnes of equivalent green steel tonnes available by the end of 2022.  ‘XCarb™ recycled and renewably produced’  ‘XCarb™ recycled and renewably produced’ has been designed for products made via the Electric Arc Furnace (‘EAF’) route using scrap steel. Recycled and renewably produced means that the physical steel was made with recycled material (scrap) using renewable electricity, giving it an extremely low CO2 footprint that can be as low as approximately 300kg of CO2 per tonne of finished steel when the metallics are 100% scrap. This customer offer is for both flat and long products. The electricity used in the steelmaking process is independently verified, with a ‘Guarantee of Origin’ given that it is from renewable sources.  ‘XCarb™ innovation fund’  ArcelorMittal has launched an innovation fund which will invest up to $100 million annually in groundbreaking companies developing pioneering or breakthrough technologies that will accelerate the steel industry’s transition to carbon neutral steelmaking. To be eligible for funding, companies will have to be developing technologies which support ArcelorMittal on its journey to decarbonise. The technology also needs to be commercially scalable.

{"id":6551,"text":"Using green hydrogen, up to 3.5 million tonnes of steel could be produced by the Bremen and Eisenhuttenstadt sites by 2030, with significantly lower CO2 emissions. Depending on the amount of hydrogen available, CO2 savings of more than 5 million tonnes could be possible. The technology conversion requires investments in the range of €1-1.5 billion.  \"With our concept for the transformation of the plants in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, we are accelerating the implementation of carbon-neutral steel production. These projects have the potential to have a significant impact in reducing CO2 emissions, in line with the European Union’s climate commitments. We are now asking for the necessary support and access to funding, to make the implementation of our plans happen \" said Reiner Blaschek, CEO of ArcelorMittal Flachstahl Deutschland.  In Germany, the group already operates Europe’s only DRI-EAF plant in Hamburg, where the switch to using hydrogen instead of natural gas in the iron ore reduction process is being prepared. The objective is to reach industrial commercial maturity of the technology by 2025, initially producing 100,000 tonnes of sponge iron a year.  Background  To implement the projects, ArcelorMittal is planning to gradually adapt production in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt in order to be able to competitively manufacture carbon-neutral, high-quality steel using hydrogen in the iron ore reduction process.  This year, two blast furnaces – one in Bremen and one in Eisenhuttenstadt - will be converted to inject natural gas, reducing the use of coal in the iron ore reduction process and thereby further reducing CO2 emissions.  As a next step, innovative DRI-EAF plants are to be set up at both locations. In Bremen, ArcelorMittal initially plans to use natural gas for the DRI, and later hydrogen from electrolysis; the hydrogen is to be made available as part of the regional North German Clean Hydrogen Coastline network. The sponge iron produced in the Bremen DRI unit will initially supply the steelworks in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, until the regional hydrogen cluster in East Brandenburg can also supply the Eisenhüttenstadt site with sufficient hydrogen. In the transition phase, the additional hydrogen required in Eisenhüttenstadt will be generated from natural gas with the help of a pyrolysis plant that will be built on the steel plant’s premises. To secure the future supply of hydrogen, both sites are to be integrated into the European hydrogen network in the long term via the regional hydrogen networks.  ArcelorMittal has set itself the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 30 percent by 2030 in Europe and producing carbon-neutral steel by 2050. To this end, ArcelorMittal is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology routes, Smart Carbon and an innovative DRI-based route.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal plans major investment in German sites, to accelerate CO2 emissions reduction strategy and leverage the hydrogen grid  ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal is planning to build a large-scale industrial plant for the direct reduction of iron ore (DRI) and electric arc furnace (EAF)-based steelmaking at its site in Bremen, as well as an innovative DRI pilot plant in addition to an electric arc furnace (EAF) in Eisenhüttenstadt, following the announcement of the planned expansion of Germany’s hydrogen infrastructure.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-plans-major-investment-in-german-sites-to-accelerate-co2-emissions-reduction-strategy-and-leverage-the-hydrogen-grid\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6558,"text":"The review, which can be accessed here, underpins the Company’s commitment to transparent reporting. It has been produced in-line with the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework, the Global Reporting Index Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016, the United Nations Global Compact, the European Union’s Directive 2014\/95\/EU on non-financial reporting and the Sustainability Accounting Standards.  The review provides an overview of the Company’s performance in 2020, outlines the progress it made against its strategic priorities and details its short- and long-term plans. Specifically, the review outlines ArcelorMittal’s performance and ambitions across the following areas: health and safety; delivering financial value; innovating smarter steels and solutions; and driving environmental and social sustainability. It also demonstrates the Company’s approach to ensuring it brings long-term, sustainable value to its broad stakeholder base.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “2020 was, by any measure, an extraordinary year. The Covid-19 global pandemic caused unprecedented disruption to societies, businesses and individuals across the globe, forcing us all to re-think the way we live and work. Our clear priority throughout the pandemic was to keep our employees safe and well. We are proud of the care they showed each other and their commitment to keeping the business running.  “Yet for all the challenges of 2020, it was also a year of progress for ArcelorMittal. We achieved our net debt target and improved the quality and earnings capability of our asset portfolio. The upshot is a higher growth portfolio as we are able to focus investment behind higher growth opportunities in markets like Brazil, Mexico, India and Liberia.  “I have therefore stepped into the CEO role at a time when the company is in many ways stronger, allowing me to focus on the four strategic pillars which underpin our vision to remain the world’s leading steel company in the coming decades. The first three – having a strong balance sheet, growth portfolio and competitive cost position – put the Company in a strong position to grow and develop.  “The fourth pillar of our strategy is our ambition to be a sector leader in sustainability. Global concern for sustainability and responsible business continued to grow in 2020, perhaps even accentuated by the challenge of the pandemic. We track performance according to five sustainable development themes but three issues in particular stand out – safety, decarbonisation and diversity. Despite considerable effort, we know our safety performance is not good enough. The Executive Office, the sustainability committee and the full board has discussed this in depth as a result of which changes have been introduced which we hope will support a step change in our safety performance.  “Although the transition to a low carbon society is a significant challenge, it also presents ArcelorMittal with tremendous opportunity. A significant milestone in our decarbonisation ambitions was the launch in March of XCarb™, a brand that brings together all of ArcelorMittal’s reduced, low- and zero-carbon steelmaking activities into a single effort, focused on achieving demonstrable progress towards carbon-neutral steel.   “It is widely recognised that diverse teams bring many benefits to organisations, including an increased wealth of perspectives and the capacity to make better-informed decisions. While our workforce is internationally diverse, our key issue has been gender diversity. We have worked on the plans to address it and are targeting doubling the number of female managers – or higher – by 2030.   “I hope we will be able to report progress on our key metrics in 2021. When it comes to sustainability, steel is an ideal material in the circular economy since it is easily recoverable and infinitely recyclable. I remain very confident in the future of steel, and in the ability of ArcelorMittal to succeed in this environment and continue to invent the smarter steels we need for a better world.”   Lakshmi Mittal, Executive Chairman, ArcelorMittal, added:  “Our vision is to remain the world’s leading steel company for many decades to come. We are aware that our ability to do so will be shaped not only by our financial performance but also our social and environmental performance, and particularly our ability to decarbonise. I have seen many fascinating and transformational developments in my decades in business. None, I believe, have quite the same implications as the challenge to decarbonise the global economy.  “It is a mammoth task for everyone and particularly for those of us operating in the so-called ‘hard to abate sectors’ which includes steel. We are acutely aware of the carbon footprint associated with steelmaking. Nevertheless, we remain confident that steel can and will remain the material of choice for building the world’s infrastructure. While we in no way underestimate the challenge of the transition, we are energised by the opportunities it will provide. Much of the infrastructure required for the transition to a low-carbon economy for example, including renewable energy systems and electric vehicles, depend on steel.  “The potential of the opportunity is what keeps us focused and energised. Our teams of engineers are working hard to ensure ArcelorMittal plays a leading role in the decarbonisation of our industry. Our financial strength, our innovative nature and the ingenuity and capability of our people to find solutions to the toughest challenges stands us in good stead to fulfil our purpose of inventing smarter steels for a better world.”  Key highlights discussed in the review include:    * Actions taken to protect the safety and wellbeing of our employees and support local communities during the pandemic. These included accessing essential medical supplies and personal protective equipment, using our global networks to facilitate the transfer of equipment to regions which are most in need, and financial donations to healthcare facilities, including laboratories to carry out Covid tests.   * The steps the Company is taking to improve its health and safety performance. Initiatives include enhanced governance, the re-vamping of the Company’s global Health and Safety Council and efforts aimed at instilling an interdependent safety culture group-wide.   * The Company’s strategy to address its carbon challenge and become a sector leader in sustainability, including the launch of XCarb™ in March and updates on the various decarbonisation projects being developed and deployed. In line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, in 2020 the Company announced a group-wide commitment to being carbon-neutral by 2050, and will shortly be announcing a group-wide CO2 emissions target for 2030.   * Progress the Company has made in reducing the carbon intensity of the steel it produces; CO2 per tonne of steel was 2.08 tonnes in 2020, a 1.4% improvement over 2019 and a 7.9% improvement since 2007, meeting the Company’s 2020 target.   * Insight into how the Company is managing its broader environmental impact, including detail on the $248 million allocated to 20 projects with energy and\/or carbon benefits, and the $396 million allocated to 32 projects which will deliver a broad range of environmental benefits.   * Progress towards meeting steel and mining certification and accreditation standards; following Covid-19 related delays, the Company has re-started the process of certifying its European flat products sites against ResponsibleSteel™ certification standards and committed to achieving Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) accreditation for its mines in Brazil, Canada, Liberia and Mexico by 2025.   * The importance the Company places on R&D, as evidenced by its $245 million R&D investment in 2020, which supported the launch of 29 new products and solutions to accelerate sustainable lifestyles and 27 to support sustainable construction, infrastructure and energy generation.   * Our plans to continue to improve on diversity and inclusion, including our target to double the representation of women in management positions to 25% by 2030.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes 2020 integrated annual review","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) has today published its 2020 integrated annual review, ‘Inventing smarter steels for a better world’.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-publishes-2020-integrated-annual-review\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6559,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces the completion of its first XCarb™ innovation fund investment since launching the initiative in March 2021. The Company has invested an initial $10 million in Heliogen, a renewable energy technology company which focuses on ‘unlocking the power of sunlight to replace fossil fuels’.  Heliogen’s technology will harness solar energy by using a field of mirrors which will act as a multi-acre magnifying glass to concentrate and capture sunlight. The sunlight will then be subsequently converted into heat (HelioHeat™), electricity (HelioPower™) or clean fuels (HelioFuel™).  All three Heliogen products have the potential to be applicable to the steelmaking process and support the steel industry’s transition to carbon-neutrality. HelioHeat™, for example, could be used to increase the temperature of air blown into a blast furnace, offsetting the use of fossil fuel. The Heliogen technology will also be capable of creating 100 per cent green hydrogen, which Heliogen is working to develop as its first HelioFuel™. Hydrogen sits at the heart of ArcelorMittal’s Innovative-DRI technology pathway, which involves using hydrogen instead of natural gas as the reductant in the production of direct reduced iron.  In addition to the $10 million investment, ArcelorMittal and Heliogen have signed a Memorandum of Understanding which aims to evaluate the potential of Heliogen’s products in several of ArcelorMittal’s steel plants.  Commenting, Pinakin Chaubal, Chief Technology Officer, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Developing and deploying breakthrough technologies is at the heart of our climate action strategy. While our own efforts are progressing well, the objective of our XCarb™ Innovation fund is to extend our reach and support companies developing technologies which could assist us on our decarbonisation journey. The technology Heliogen is developing has the potential to do exactly that.  “Moreover, the partnership we have established with Heliogen goes beyond investment. The MoU we have signed means we are actively exploring working with them to deploy their technologies in our steel plants, enhancing our ongoing programme of decarbonisation initiatives. Establishing partnerships of this kind has an important role to play in ensuring we succeed in our ambition to lead our industry’s efforts to decarbonise, and reach carbon-neutrality by 2050.”  Bill Gross, CEO and Founder, Heliogen, added:  “The future of our planet and civilization hinges on the global economy’s ability to shift from its reliance on fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. We founded Heliogen to eliminate the need for fossil fuels in all sectors of the economy and to empower a sustainable future. We’re thrilled to welcome ArcelorMittal as an investor in the company.”  “We’re also excited to begin working with ArcelorMittal to explore how our technology can support its significant decarbonization efforts. Heliogen’s Sunlight Refinery™, which will cost-effectively deliver 24\/7 carbon-free energy in the form of heat, electricity, or hydrogen fuels at scale for the first time in history, was designed for use by a spectrum of industries, including steel. Together, ArcelorMittal and Heliogen can meaningfully help the world achieve carbon neutrality.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal makes first investment through its XCarb™ innovation fund ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Initial $10 million investment part of broader partnership established with Heliogen","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-makes-first-investment-through-its-xcarb-innovation-fund\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6570,"text":"ArcelorMittal today announces that its Sestao plant in Spain will become the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant.  The development is the result of a memorandum of understanding signed today with the Government of Spain that will see an investment of €1 billion in the construction of a green hydrogen direct reduced iron (DRI) plant at its plant in Gijón, as well as a new hybrid electric arc furnace (EAF).  By 2025, the Sestao plant – which manufactures a range of flat steel products for the automotive and construction sectors, and general industry - will produce 1.6 million tonnes of zero carbon-emissions steel by:    1. Changing the metallic input by increasing the proportion of circular, recycled scrap, and using green hydrogen-produced DRI from Gijón in its two existing EAFs.   2. Powering all steelmaking assets (EAFs, rolling mill, finishing lines) with renewable electricity.   3. Introducing several key emerging technologies that will replace the small, remaining use of fossil fuel in the steelmaking process with carbon-neutral energy inputs, such as sustainable biomass or green hydrogen.    Central to this development will be the construction of a 2.3 million-tonne green hydrogen DRI unit in Gijón. Around 1 million tonnes of DRI will be transported to Sestao to be used a feedstock for its two EAFs.  The national and the Basque government’s support in this project is crucial, firstly from a funding perspective, given the significant cost associated with the transition to carbon-neutral steelmaking. Secondly, because it will enable ArcelorMittal to have access to green hydrogen supplied through a consortium of companies that will cooperate in the construction of the infrastructure required in order to produce hydrogen in the Iberian Peninsula using solar‑powered electrolysis and to transport it directly through a network of pipelines. The initiative involves the construction of multiple large-scale solar farms, with hydrogen produced in situ and with the corresponding impact in terms of employment.  In addition to the investments in the DRI and EAF installations in Gijón, ArcelorMittal will invest €50 million in Sestao. This will fund the introduction of key emerging technologies required to bring the plant to zero carbon-emissions, supporting 1.6 million tonnes of production.  Looking further ahead, the company has also committed to achieving net zero[2] at the Sestao plant as soon as possible.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:  “It is widely understood that for the world to achieve net-zero by 2050, faster progress over the next decade is essential. Having announced a net-zero target for 2050, we therefore set ourselves the challenge to identify how we could take an existing steel plant to zero carbon-emissions within the next five years. Our teams have been working incredibly hard to turn this ambition into the plan that we have announced today. This is a hugely significant development and demonstrates the strength of innovation embedded in our people, our unparalleled technology leadership, and what can be achieved through investment in existing steelmaking infrastructure. It means ArcelorMittal will be the first company in the world to be in a position to offer its customers meaningful volumes of zero carbon-emissions steel.  “The ability of the Sestao plant to become the world’s first zero carbon-emissions steel plant would not be possible without the support and partnership of the Spanish government. This is a project that will require the support of many different partners to succeed; the plan hinges on the supply of affordable, mass-scale hydrogen, access to sustainable finance and a supportive legal framework that allows us to be competitive globally. The Spanish government has embraced the opportunity and developed clearly defined plans to transition the country to having the energy infrastructure that the green economy will require. ArcelorMittal plans to switch Sestao to renewable electricity. This, together with the green DRI and hydrogen feeding the burners, will result in the Sestao plant achieving zero carbon-emissions. We are also working to reduce Scope 3 emissions to zero.  “As a large emitter, the steel industry can make a vital contribution to achieving net zero by 2050. This project demonstrates what is achievable.”  [1] On a Scope 1 and 2 basis.  [2] Net zero meaning across Scopes 1, 2 and 3.

{"id":6571,"text":"ArcelorMittal has today signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Spanish Government that will see a €1 billion investment in decarbonisation technologies at ArcelorMittal Asturias’ plant in Gijón. The investments will reduce CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal’s Spanish operations by up to 4.8 million tonnes, which represents approximately 50% of emissions, within the next five years[2].  The MoU states the commitment of ArcelorMittal and the Government of Spain to transition towards a decarbonised steel industry. ArcelorMittal will introduce new manufacturing processes that contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions. It will also further intensify its R&D capabilities in Spain to support the new project and innovation requirements. The Government of Spain will promote reforms and investments to support the development and growth of a strong, more competitive and sustainable industrial sector, as well as endeavouring to provide maximum financial support for the project, in line with Spanish legislation and European Union regulations.  Given the significant cost associated with the transition, in terms of both capex and opex, it is ArcelorMittal’s expectation this support will cover at least half of the additional cost to enable its operations to remain competitive as it accelerates its decarbonisation program.  The MoU was signed at an event in ArcelorMittal Asturias’ plant in Gijón, which was attended by ArcelorMittal Executive Chairman, Lakshmi Mittal, CEO Aditya Mittal and the President of Spain, Pedro Sánchez as well as Raül Blanco, the Secretary General for Industry, and Adrián Barbón, President of the Asturias regional government.  At the heart of the plan is a 2.3 million-tonne green hydrogen direct reduced iron (DRI) unit, complemented by a 1.1 million-tonne hybrid electric arc furnace (EAF). This starts the transition of the Gijón plant away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the DRI-EAF production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint. The new DRI - which will be the first of its kind in Spain - and EAF will be in production before the end of 2025.   To maximize the emissions reduction potential, ultimately green hydrogen will be used to reduce the iron ore in the DRI, with the EAF powered by renewable electricity. The support of the national and regional governments in this project is crucial as it will enable ArcelorMittal to have access to green hydrogen supplied through a consortium of companies that will cooperate in the construction of the infrastructure required in order to produce hydrogen in the Iberian Peninsula using solar‑powered electrolysis and to transport it directly through a network of pipelines. The initiative involves the construction of multiple large-scale solar farms, with hydrogen produced in situ and with the corresponding impact in terms of employment.  The Gijón DRI will also feed the company’s Sestao plant, situated approximately 250km from Gijón, where production is already entirely from the electric arc furnace route. This means that by 2025 ArcelorMittal Sestao will produce 1.6 million tonnes of steel and be the world’s first full-scale steel plant to achieve zero carbon-emissions.   Speaking at the signing of the MoU in Gijón, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:   “It is widely understood that for the world to achieve net-zero by 2050, faster progress over the next decade is essential. The MoU we have signed today will play an important role in doing exactly that. The construction of the new green hydrogen DRI plant in Gijón will not only enable us to reduce emissions from our Spanish operations by half but will also result in the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant in Sestao.  “Clearly, this is a project that will require the support of many different partners to succeed; our plan hinges on the supply of affordable, mass-scale hydrogen, access to sustainable finance and a supportive legal framework that allows us to be competitive globally. The Spanish government has clearly defined plans to transition the country to a decarbonised economy and I have been impressed by the progress made in creating the energy infrastructure that this green economy will require.  “As a large emitter, the steel industry can make a vital contribution to achieving net zero by 2050. This project demonstrates what is achievable.”  Expressing their support for the plan, Spain’s Minister of Industry María Reyes Maroto said:   “The Government of Spain and the ArcelorMittal Group fully agree that the transition towards a decarbonised economy is an essential objective for Spain, and they both recognise the industrial, technological and regulatory challenges that this transition poses for Spanish industry, as well as the opportunities it offers, in terms of innovation and improved competitiveness. The Government of Spain, through the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, will strongly support a new framework of institutional relations between the Government and the ArcelorMittal Group, because the Government of Spain recognises the importance of the steel industry for the development of the Spanish economy, while also recognising that the industry needs a stable and predictable legal framework as the best tool to enable it to be competitive and attain the targets set in terms of energy transition and digitalisation, both at national and at European Union level. In this regard, the Government of Spain is exploring regulatory instruments to support the industry in the transition process, such as the compensation programmes for electricity-intensive industries, tools to promote improved energy efficiency, public financing for digitalisation, instruments to promote industrial investments, training programmes and strategies to promote the use of clean fuels.”  ArcelorMittal Europe has a target to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, and an ambition to be net-zero by 2050. The company is pursuing two pathways to achieve this: Innovative DRI and Smart Carbon.  ArcelorMittal Spain’s operations are already contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions from the company’s steelmaking operations. Earlier this year, ArcelorMittal Asturias completed its project to capture hydrogen-rich coke oven gas and re-inject it into the blast furnace, replacing some of the coke used in the blast furnace. Deploying this innovative technology will result in a reduction in CO2 emissions of 125,000 tonnes a year, equivalent to the emissions generated by the annual consumption of 84,000 Spanish households with individual natural gas-based heating systems. These CO2 savings have already generated XCarb™ green steel certificates, which were launched by the company in March 2021, allowing ArcelorMittal customers to report a reduction in their Scope 3 CO2 emissions.

{"id":6573,"text":"In the project CO2, which would otherwise have been emitted, will be separated and recovered from carbon-rich waste gas from the steelmaking process. An innovative chemical process, developed by SEKISUI CHEMICAL in Japan, then converts the waste CO2 into carbon monoxide rich Synthesis Gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen). The Synthesis Gas is then returned to the steelmaking process as an alternative reduction agent for iron ore, thereby lowering the volume of fossil resources required in the steelmaking process.  Key to this work is SEKISUI CHEMICAL’s innovative technology that converts CO2 to carbon monoxide at high yield. To date, producing carbon monoxide in large volumes from CO2 has been very challenging. SEKISUI CHEMICAL aims to demonstrate the ability to scale up its new technology through this partnership with ArcelorMittal.  The technology will initially be trialled over a three-year period at one of ArcelorMittal’s research and development laboratories located in Asturias, Spain, commencing in the third quarter of 2021. The investment cost of the project is USD1.9 million.  Pinakin Chaubal, Chief Technology Officer at ArcelorMittal, said:  “This is an exciting albeit early stage technology which complements our existing carbon capture and re-use or storage technology (CCUS) initiatives. Successfully decarbonising steelmaking will involve multiple technologies and we expect CCUS technologies to have an important role to play. This view is shared by the International Energy Agency which said in its recent ‘Net Zero by 2050’ report that CCUS technologies will be attached to over 50% of steel production by 2050.”  Katsunori Mukai, Director of Corporate R&D at SEKISUI CHEMICAL said:  “SEKISUI CHEMICAL has been developing basic technologies for sustainable societies. One of them is focussed on giving ‘LIFE to CO2’ by enabling carbon recycling in manufacturing industries. In this inter-industry partnership with ArcelorMittal, we are aiming to help reduce the carbon emissions of the steel industry.”  ArcelorMittal has a target of reducing CO2 emissions in Europe by 30 per cent by 2030 and producing carbon-neutral steel group-wide by 2050. To this end, ArcelorMittal is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology pathways, Smart Carbon and Innovative-DRI. Within its Smart Carbon pathway, ArcelorMittal is already developing and deploying other carbon capture and re-use technologies including Carbalyst, a €165 million project in Ghent, Belgium, which converts carbon-rich steelmaking waste gases into bio-ethanol, and IGAR, an industrial-scale pilot project in Dunkirk, France, to capture waste CO2 and waste hydrogen from the steelmaking process and convert it into synthetic gas to replace the use of fossil fuel in steelmaking.

{"id":6575,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces it has completed its second investment in the Company’s recently launched XCarb™ innovation fund, serving as lead investor in Form Energy’s $200 million Series D financing round, with a $25 million equity injection.  Form Energy, which was founded in 2017 is working to accelerate the development of its breakthrough low-cost energy storage technology to enable a reliable, secure, and fully-renewable electric grid year-round. It has recently unveiled a new iron-air battery which is: low-cost (approximately one-tenth the cost of lithium-ion battery technology); has multi-day reliability (100-hour duration hence overcomes the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation); scalable; and can be sited anywhere.  Alongside the $25 million investment, ArcelorMittal and Form Energy have signed a joint development agreement to explore the potential for ArcelorMittal to provide iron, tailored to specific requirements, to Form Energy as the iron input into their battery technology.  Commenting, Greg Ludkovsky, global head of research and development, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Form Energy is at the leading edge of developments in the long-duration, grid-scale battery storage space. The multi-day energy storage technology they have developed holds exciting potential to overcome the issue of intermittent supply of renewable energy. They are exactly the kind of ambitious and innovative company we are seeking to invest in through our XCarb™ innovation fund.  “In addition to our investment, there are obvious synergies we are exploring with them. These include from ArcelorMittal supplying iron for their battery solutions, through to the potential their batteries hold to deliver us a permanent, reliable supply of renewably generated energy for our steel plants, therefore helping us in our journey to transition to carbon-neutral steelmaking.”  Mateo Jaramillo, CEO and co-founder of Form Energy, added:  “This is an extremely exciting time at Form Energy and we are pleased to welcome ArcelorMittal as a business partner and investor. ArcelorMittal is a world’s leading steel and mining company and this investment demonstrates their commitment to innovation and deep decarbonization. We appreciate their confidence in our team and in our technology as we work to reshape the global electric system to enable a clean energy future.”  The investment is the second ArcelorMittal has made in its XCarb™ innovation fund since its launch in March 2021. It follows an initial $10 million investment in Heliogen, a renewable energy technology company which focuses on ‘unlocking the power of sunlight to replace fossil fuels’, on 8 June.  The XCarb™ innovation fund – in which ArcelorMittal anticipates investing up to $100 million a year - is designed to invest in companies which are developing technologies which have the potential to support and accelerate the transition to carbon-neutral steelmaking. It was launched as part of ArcelorMittal’s wider XCarb™ initiative, which will ultimately encompass all the Company’s efforts to progress to carbon-neutrality.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal invests $25 million in Form Energy ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Agreement concludes second investment in ArcelorMittal’s XCarb™ innovation fund","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-invests-25-million-in-form-energy\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6577,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) has today published its second group climate action report, following the first group report published in May 2019 and the European climate action report published in May 2020.  In the new report, ArcelorMittal has for the first time announced a 2030 global carbon emissions intensity reduction target of 25%. It has also increased its European 2030 carbon emissions intensity reduction target to 35% from 30% previously announced. All targets are on a scope 1 and 2 basis. The Company had previously announced a net zero by 2050 ambition in September 2020.  The Company’s targets are underpinned by a set of assumptions:    * The cost of green hydrogen will become increasingly competitive over the next decade but will still require government support.   * Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) infrastructure will take time to be built at scale. While Europe is expected to take the lead, CCUS infrastructure has the potential to expand quickly in the US and Canada – providing some potential upside to our assumptions.   * Different regions of the world will continue to move at very different paces and the level of climate ambition will differ between jurisdictions at any given time.   * The introduction of climate-friendly policies in other regions will be 5–10 years behind Europe.    Reflecting these assumptions, each region in which the Company operates is designated as either ‘Accelerate’ (supported by the introduction of more ambitious climate change policy) or ‘Move’ (reflecting a policy environment not yet providing any meaningful support to accelerate steel industry decarbonization and where accelerating without supportive policy will render the asset uncompetitive versus national\/regional competition).  2030 target breakdown and capex  The new climate action report provides a roadmap that illustrates the Company’s current thinking on the journey to net zero steelmaking. Five key levers are identified as the stepping-stones to achieve net zero by 2050. These are:  A – Steelmaking transformation: In the course of the coming decades the steel industry will undergo a transformation of the assets used to make steel on a scale not seen for over 100 years. This includes in a first phase the transition from coal (in the blast furnace) to natural gas (in a DRI plant) as a precursor to green hydrogen DRI.  B – Energy transformation: The energy used to make steel in future years will undergo a further and more radical transition, from high-emitting fossil fuel-based energy to low and zero-carbon emissions forms of energy. This includes green hydrogen, circular forms of carbon and CCUS technologies.  C – Increased use of scrap: As well as using scrap in the EAF, we will increase the use of scrap in blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) steelmaking.  D – Sourcing clean electricity: We will focus on increasing the amount of low and zero-carbon emissions electricity we consume. We plan to do this by purchasing renewable energy certificates and by direct power purchase agreements (PPA) with suppliers from renewable projects.  E – Offsetting residual emissions: There are likely to remain residual emissions for which either there is no feasible technological solution or the solution involves excessively high economic or social costs. For these emissions ArcelorMittal will buy high-quality offsets or launch projects to generate high-quality carbon credits.   Further specific detail for the 2030 target is provided aligning with these five levers, as follows:  1-  |   Announced projects Innovative DRI-EAF  |   -7.5%  |   A, C      ---|---|---|---      2-  |   Announced projects Smart Carbon and gas injection  |   -1.6%   |   B      3-  |   Further projects in development in Europe   |   -5.1%   |   A, B, C      4-  |   Project in NAFTA to be announced  |   -1.5%   |   A, B, C      4-  |   Further projects in development ex-Europe  |   -7.4%   |   A, B, C      5-  |   Sourcing clean electricity  |   -2.1%  |   D      To achieve this reduction the Company has estimated it will require a gross investment of c. $10 billion of capital expenditure. The Company expects to deploy approximately 35% of this c. $10 billion investment by 2025 with the remainder in the second part of this decade.  Over time, and with the deployment of appropriate technologies, it is expected that low-carbon steel-making technologies will become more competitive than higher-carbon steel-making technologies. However, this is not the case today and therefore companies will need support through well-designed policy to help moderate the initial capital costs, which will not yield a reasonable EBITDA return in the short-to-medium term, as well as the higher opex costs in the transition period that could otherwise render them uncompetitive. ArcelorMittal believes support of approximately 50% of total costs will be needed to enable companies to remain competitive regionally and globally through the transition period.   In terms of our investment decision-making, each major capex project proposal is required to demonstrate its CO2 impact to our Investment Allocation Committee (IAC). The IAC considers both the potential future carbon cost as well as the capital cost of decarbonization, to maximize our chances of achieving our targets while ensuring each project is economically justifiable and earns its cost of capital.  The announced Innovative DRI-EAF projects include:    * Reducing emissions in Spain by 50% by constructing a 2.3 million tonne hydrogen-powered DRI unit at Gijon, as well as a new hybrid EAF. The construction of these units will transition the Gijon plant away from BF-BOF steelmaking to DRI-EAF production.   * Transforming ArcelorMittal Sestao to be the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant by 2025. 1 million tonnes of DRI will be transported by rail from Gijon to Sestao to be used as feedstock for its two EAFs. Sestao will also change its metallic input; power all steelmaking assets with renewable electricity; introduce new emerging technologies that will replace the remaining use of fossil fuels in the steelmaking process with carbon-neutral energy inputs.   * Plans to build a large-scale industrial plant for DRI and EAF-based steelmaking in Bremen, as well as an innovative DRI plant and EAF in Eisenhuttenstadt. CO2 savings of up to more than 5 million tonnes could be possible depending on the availability of green hydrogen.   * The construction of a DRI plant in Dunkirk to produce 2 million tonnes per year of hot metal, reducing CO2 emissions by 2.85 million tonnes by 2030.   * Testing of hydrogen injection at our DRI facility in Quebec. The test will start with a limited injection of 5% within the energy mix and further phases are planned in the future. Renewable sources – specifically hydroelectric – provide 99% of Quebec’s energy.    The announced Smart Carbon projects include:    * Torero and Carbalyst – two technologies to enable the use of circular carbon, which does not add carbon to the biosphere. Torero is a torrefaction process to make steel-specific bioenergy from waste wood and waste plastic. Carbalyst allows us to use steelmaking waste gases to produce basic chemicals such as bio-ethanol, which are the key building blocks of plastics.   * In Gent, we are constructing an industrial-scale demonstration plant that converts waste wood into bio-coal through torrefaction. Two reactors will each produce 40,000 tonnes of bio-coal annually that can be used in the blast furnace as a substitute for coal. Reactor 1 is expected to start production in 2022 and reactor 2 in 2024.   * In Gent we are also constructing an industrial scale Steelanol demonstration plant to capture carbon off-gases from the blast furnace and convert them into bioethanol using microbes. The plant is expected to be completed in 2022 and will produce 80 million litres of bioethanol annually.    ArcelorMittal continues to believe that both technology pathways (Innovative DRI and Smart Carbon) have an important role to play in helping the steel industry, and the global economy, achieve net zero by 2050. Furthermore, the Company continues to develop a third route, direct electrolysis, which is still in the research and development phase. Which specific routes will ultimately be adopted is likely to differ from region to region and depend on policy choices and the availability of government funding. The Company has been able to accelerate plans for the world’s first zero carbon-emission steel plant in Spain for example because of government policy to accelerate the availability of green hydrogen.  Policy   The Company has also outlined in the report the combination of policy instruments it believes will be required to address not just the significant capital expenditure to transition to the new zero carbon-emissions technologies, but also the considerably higher operating costs associated with these technologies at least in the short-medium term until low and zero carbon-emission technologies become competitive. Policy instruments such as contracts for difference, used so effectively in enabling the renewable energy industry to become competitive, will play an important role in ensuring a level playing field during the transition period.  ArcelorMittal intends to actively and directly engage with policymakers and organisations that advocate for the policies and conditions that will enable steel to accelerate and achieve its net-zero transition globally while remaining competitive.  Science based targets  The Company has also announced a new collaboration with the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) and a commitment to publish a science-based target within the next two years. The collaboration will support the SBTi to develop a new science-based methodology for the steel sector.   As part of the Net Zero Steel Pathway Methodology Project (NZSPMP), ArcelorMittal has, with other steelmakers, been working on a set of principles by which it believes the steel industry’s alignment with a net zero by 2050 outcome should be measured. These principles were published on 27 July.   Just transition  ArcelorMittal is aware of key stakeholder concerns around a just transition. We are seeking to employ best practice principles to understand the social impact of our decarbonization strategy and support engagement with our key stakeholders and collaborate with policy makers in addressing this issue.  TCFD and Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Benchmark Alignment   The Company has followed the TCFD guidelines and the Climate Action 100 Net Zero benchmark. While we have not yet achieved full disclosure according to either the TCFD or CA100 Net Zero benchmark, we believe this report marks a meaningful step forward, thereby demonstrating to stakeholders our commitment to adopting a leadership position in the decarbonization of the steel industry in terms of target-setting, performance and disclosure.  Executive remuneration  The Company now intends to link these targets to executive remuneration. Details will be published in due course.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal said:  “As the world’s most prolific material, steel can make a huge contribution to the decarbonization of the global economy. Steel is already the material of choice due to its lower carbon footprint and high recyclability. But we can and must go further as zero carbon-emissions steel has the potential to be the backbone of the buildings, infrastructure, industry and machinery, and transport systems that will enable governments, customers and investors to meet their net-zero commitments.  “ArcelorMittal has been working hard to be at the forefront of our sector in the net-zero transition, as we believe not only will this help decarbonize the global economy but will also generate opportunities in multiple aspects of our business.   “This is reflected in the new targets we have announced today. We have for the first time published a group target for 2030, alongside a more ambitious target for our European business. These targets we believe are aligned with our net zero 2050 ambition and we have also announced today a new collaboration with the Science Based Target initiative.  “These targets reflect the uneven pace of change that is the reality of the world’s decarbonization journey. In regions of the world like Europe, where we are observing an ‘Accelerate’ policy scenario, we can be more ambitious – with plans to reduce emissions by 35% within the next decade. In other markets we face a situation where being a first mover will result in us being uncompetitive in that market. For our target setting today we assume progress in other regions of the world will be at least five years behind Europe.   “With COP26 focused on addressing the acceleration that is critical in the next decade if the world is to reach its 2050 target, it may be that we will see a swifter evolution of this policy environment than is currently envisaged. Policymaking has a catalytic role to play. ArcelorMittal intends to step up our advocacy for policies that support the acceleration of this transition, addressing the fact that both capex and opex costs will be significantly higher, at least in the short to medium term.   “Ultimately the goal is to ensure that the technologies that will decarbonize the steel-making process are competitive. The good news is that we already have two technology routes - Innovative DRI and Smart Carbon - which can enable the decarbonization of the industry with a third, direct electrolysis, looking encouraging. Given our global profile we believe it is sensible to continue to develop both these technology routes which essentially encompass the clean energy routes of both green hydrogen and also bio-energy with carbon capture utilization and storage.  “In Europe our strategy is largely focused on the Innovative DRI pathway. This reflects the commitment in Europe to prioritize the availability of green hydrogen at competitive prices. Spain’s plan to accelerate the availability of renewable energy and green hydrogen underpins our recent announcement that ArcelorMittal Sestao will become the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant.   “In many respects the challenges confronting steelmaking today resemble those faced by renewable energy over a decade ago. The importance of solar and wind was widely acknowledged yet the technology remained economically prohibitive. Targeted, reliable and thoughtful policies supported innovation and investment that enabled both companies and their financing partners to make long-term planning decisions.  “We are optimistic that the same will happen in steel. It is too critical a material on so many levels for that not to be the case. And as developing economies continue to grow, the world will need more steel, not less, to give a better quality of life to billions of people.  “Over this past year, we have engaged with our stakeholders on climate more than ever before. I hope this report demonstrates how seriously we take your input, how closely we have listened to your questions, and how committed we are to providing solutions.”","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal publishes second group climate action report","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"- Targeting 25% global carbon-emissions reduction by 2030  - Estimated cost of c. $10 billion  - Europe 2030 target increased to 35%  - ArcelorMittal Sestao to become world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions plant - New collaboration announced with Science Based Targets initiative - Targets to be linked to executive remuneration","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-publishes-second-group-climate-action-report\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6579,"text":"ArcelorMittal (the ‘Company’) has today announced with the Government of Canada its intention for a CAD$1.765 billion investment in decarbonization technologies at ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton. The intended investments will reduce annual CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal’s Hamilton, Ontario operations by approximately 3 million tonnes, which represents approximately 60% of emissions, within the next seven years. This means the Hamilton plant will transition away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) – Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint.  ArcelorMittal will introduce new manufacturing processes that contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions and deliver other positive environmental impacts including the elimination of emissions and flaring from coke making and ironmaking operations.  The investment is contingent on support from the governments of Canada and Ontario. Today the Government of Canada announced it will invest CAD$400 million in the project. The Company is in discussions with the Government of Ontario regarding its support.  The announcement was made at an event in ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton, which was attended by ArcelorMittal CEO Aditya Mittal, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard, Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne and Minister of Labour Filomena Tassi.  At the heart of the plan is a 2 million tonne capacity DRI facility and an EAF facility capable of producing 2.4 million tonnes of high-quality steel through its existing secondary metallurgy and secondary casting facilities. Modification of the existing EAF facility and continuous casters will also be undertaken to align productivity, quality and energy capabilities between all assets in the new footprint.  The new DRI and EAF will be in production before the end of 2028.  This project contributes to the sustainability of well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing and is also expected to support as many as 2,500 jobs during the engineering and construction phases. It will also support ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s customers decarbonization ambitions while further enhancing ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s capability to support the most demanding product segments including automotive exposed, advanced high strength steels, and consumer packing.  This new production route for ArcelorMittal Dofasco will provide a technically advanced manufacturing environment for operations, maintenance, and technology staff to work in, with improved health and safety. New positions, training, and development will be provided for employees moving from existing business units to new assets, with approximately 160,000 training hours required to transition our workforce to the new footprint.  Expressing Canada’s support for the plan, Deputy and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland said:  “Our government has been steadfast in defending and championing our steel workers. Today’s announcement, through the Net Zero Accelerator, is about investing in the low-carbon transformation of Canadian industry, taking serious action in the global fight against climate change, and supporting good middle-class jobs in Hamilton. We will continue to be there to support growth and a strong economic future for our steel workers and the broader Hamilton community.”  François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, said:  “We are supporting our steel workers and companies like ArcelorMittal Dofasco as they seize today’s opportunities in the low-carbon economy and they do their part in the fight against climate change. This investment will ensure that Canada’s largest producer of flat-rolled steel adopts innovative technologies, continues to provide economic opportunities for Canadian workers, and contributes meaningfully toward our climate targets. This investment will create good jobs in communities like Hamilton and clean Canadian-made products for the world for decades to come.”  Filomena Tassi, Minister of Labour, added:  “This $400 million investment by our government in reducing greenhouse gas emissions at ArcelorMittal Dofasco will transform Hamilton. It will position ArcelorMittal Dofasco to become a world leader in the development of advanced steels and make a significant contribution to achieving Canada’s carbon pollution reduction targets. We are proud to work with organizations like ArcelorMittal Dofasco that are committed to building a stronger, more competitive economy by innovating to fight climate change and creating 2,500 new jobs.”  Speaking at the announcement in Hamilton, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:  “The plans we have announced today represent a historic moment for ArcelorMittal in Canada and North America, marking the beginning of a new era of steelmaking in Hamilton, that will result in a 60% drop in CO2 emissions within the next seven years. We are very pleased to be in partnership with the Government of Canada - as partners, we all recognize that it is vital to accelerate our carbon emissions reduction and strengthen our climate action. Indeed progress in the next decade is vital if the world is to reach net zero by 2050.  “This project is part of ArcelorMittal’s new global 25% CO2 2030 emissions reduction target which was announced yesterday in our second climate action report. DRI-EAF technology, such as that being introduced in Dofasco, is at the heart of our new target although we do also continue to develop our smart carbon technology route. Transitioning from the blast furnace route to the DRI-route, offers an immediate significant reduction in emissions in the first phase through natural gas and then in a second phase, which we call innovative DRI, harnessing green hydrogen or other Smart Carbon technologies.  “This is the first significant decarbonization project we have announced outside Europe and again reflects ArcelorMittal’s determination to lead the decarbonization of the steel industry. Across the company our people are highly motivated to demonstrate that steel can reach net zero and will be the core material for a carbon-neutral world. This project in Dofasco is a very significant and important milestone in this journey.”  Highlighting the transformative impact of the announcement, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard said:  “The Government of Canada’s investment accelerates the realization of low carbon steelmaking in Canada. This significant total investment in Hamilton will transform our organization and deliver exceptional benefits to all our stakeholders including our customers, our employees and the community.  “The new steelmaking footprint will improve our capability to support the most demanding product segments with advanced high strength steels, including those used for the emerging electric vehicles in the automotive sector. The new steelmaking stream also sustains well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing in Ontario, with the opportunity for our highly skilled employees to work in the most technically advanced Steelmaking assets in North America. The company’s bayfront property has been re-imagined and we are well on the way to a significant and broad reduction in environmental impacts, contributing to the health and sustainability of our community, the environment and the economy.”  ArcelorMittal has an ambition to be net zero by 2050. Yesterday the Company published its second group Climate Action Report in which it set a new 2030 global carbon emissions intensity reduction target of 25%. It has also increased its European 2030 carbon emissions intensity target to 35%, from 30%. ArcelorMittal estimates the cost of achieving its global 2030 carbon reduction target is c. US$10 billion and believes government funding support of approximately 50% is required to enable the Company to remain competitive regionally and globally through the transition period given the capital investment required and higher operating costs of low-carbon steelmaking technologies. The Company has developed two technology pathways, Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI, both of which it believes will have an important role to play in helping the Company achieve net zero by 2050.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal and the Government of Canada announce investment of CAD$1.765 billion in decarbonisation technologies in Canada","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"New DRI and EAF installations at ArcelorMittal Dofasco in Hamilton, Ontario will reduce carbon emissions by approximately 60%","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-and-the-government-of-canada-announce-investment-of-cad-1-765-billion-in-decarbonization-technologies-in-canada\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6583,"text":"This demonstrator plant, which will use hydrogen exclusively as the chemical agent to reduce iron ore into DRI, is intended to lay the foundation for a steelmaking process that means steel can be produced with zero carbon-emissions[1], using electric arc furnaces fed with hydrogen reduced DRI and scrap metal, powered by renewable electricity.   The Federal Government has expressed its intention to provide €55 million of funding support towards the construction of the plant, which is half of the €110 million total capital expenditure required. The next step is for the European Commission to approve the Federal Government's intention to provide funding before the installation of the new plant can begin. Production is scheduled to start in 2025.  DRI is currently produced using natural gas to reduce iron ore. In a transition phase, the process of reducing iron ore with hydrogen will first be demonstrated using hydrogen generated by the separation of waste gas from the Hamburg plant. Once available in sufficient volumes and at an affordable price, green hydrogen - made from the electrolysis of water using renewable energy - will be used. By 2030, ArcelorMittal plans to produce more than one million tonnes of zero carbon-emissions steel a year in the Hamburg plant alone, thereby saving around 800,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.  The plant is an important component of ArcelorMittal Germany’s Steel4Future strategy, which involves the conversion of its four German plants - in Hamburg, Bremen, Duisburg and Eisenhüttenstadt - to zero carbon-emissions steel production in the coming years.  Commenting, Dr. Uwe Braun, CEO ArcelorMittal Hamburg, said:  “With the intended plant, for the first time we will be able to produce 100,000 tonnes of DRI for steel production using hydrogen - as early as 2025. Our project thus contributes to the goal of greenhouse gas reduction and a low-carbon economy. The technology is also directly transferrable and shows how other steelworks in our group – like Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt - can convert to zero carbon-emissions steel production processes. But one thing is clear - the production of low or zero carbon-emissions steel is significantly more expensive than traditional steelmaking methods. When it comes to these challenges, we continue to rely on political support to create the appropriate framework conditions. The German Government's intention to provide funding helps our project and we are very grateful for this. Now we need approval from the European Commission so that words can be followed up with action.”  Svenja Schulze, German Federal Environment Minister, said:  “Ever since mankind started producing steel, it has needed coal to do so. We are helping to ensure that this will be possible in the future with hydrogen from wind and solar power. The restructuring of the steel industry is a huge challenge. The German Government will not leave the steel industry alone in the transformation. My ministry is offering concrete support for investment in climate protection through the decarbonisation funding program. For industry, our ambitious climate targets are both a challenge and an opportunity. If companies invest now in greenhouse gas-neutral processes and products such as green steel, they will be able to survive on the market in the future, and jobs will be secure. The prerequisite for all this is the expansion of renewable energies. Anyone who says yes to steel production with a future must also say yes to the spirited expansion of wind and solar energy.”  Jens Kerstan, Senator for the Environment, Climate, Energy and Agriculture in Hamburg, said:  “Those who pursue climate protection invest in the future, invest in the location and secure jobs. By switching to low-CO2 and, in the long term, climate-neutral steel production, ArcelorMittal is seizing the opportunity to become a pioneer of an innovative climate protection technology. The production of green steel is a particular challenge, and as an environmental authority we have closely supported the H2H project from the outset. I am pleased that with this project Hamburg is further expanding its pioneering role in the decarbonisation of industry. We need such innovative strategies to achieve our climate targets.\"  Michael Westhagemann, Senator for Economics and Innovation in Hamburg, said:  “Decarbonising industry, especially the steel industry, is a socio-political task of the century. The aim is to achieve our climate protection targets within the set deadlines without jeopardizing Germany as an industrial and technology location. Thanks to the commitment of the German Environment Ministry, here in Hamburg we are a good step closer to achieving this goal. Our heartfelt thanks therefore goes to the Federal Environment Minister and her office for their far-sighted support.”   Press contact: Arne Langner, [email protected], +49 30 75445-556  [1] On a Scope 1 and 2 basis.

{"id":6585,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces it has become an anchor partner in Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst program, committing to an equity investment of $100 million over the next five years.  Founded by Bill Gates, Breakthrough Energy is committed to scaling the technologies the world needs to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Breakthrough Energy’s efforts include investment vehicles, philanthropic programs, policy advocacy, and other initiatives, including Catalyst.  Catalyst, launched earlier this year, is a new model for how companies, governments, and private philanthropy can finance, produce, and ensure widespread adoption of next-generation clean technologies. The program will initially focus on four decarbonisation technologies: direct air capture (DAC); green hydrogen; long-duration energy storage (LDS); and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).  ArcelorMittal’s investment will be made through its XCarb™ innovation fund which was launched earlier this year. The Company anticipates investing up to $100 million annually through the fund in companies developing technologies with the potential to support and accelerate the transition to zero-carbon emissions steelmaking. To date, ArcelorMittal has invested $10 million in Heliogen, a renewable energy company which focuses on unlocking the power of sunlight to replace fossil fuels, and $25 million in Form Energy, which is working on the development of its breakthrough energy storage technology.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal said:  “The Catalyst program is innovative and necessary. It brings together public and private finance with the objective of fast-tracking the deployment of projects which can deliver significant carbon reduction. For ArcelorMittal and the steel industry this kind of initiative is critically important. The steel industry knows how to decarbonise – essentially what is missing is the availability of clean energy at competitive prices that provides the foundation for us to really accelerate. That’s why, after discussing the purpose of Catalyst with Bill, we were very happy to join as an anchor partner. Achieving net zero by 2050 needs a coordinated global drive the likes of which the world has never seen before. ArcelorMittal has its own comprehensive plan to decarbonise – with the first step being to achieve our group target of reducing emissions intensity by 25% by 2030 – but partnerships to scale up and accelerate progress are vital. There are so many interesting new companies and technologies that will help the world decarbonise – through both our XCarb™ fund and now Breakthrough Energy Catalyst we look forward to helping these companies accelerate their contribution.”  Bill Gates, Founder, Breakthrough Energy added:  “Avoiding a climate disaster will require a new industrial revolution. We need to make the technologies and products that don’t cause emissions as cheap as those that do, so the whole world can afford them and reach our climate goals. Through Catalyst, leaders from across the private and public sectors are coming together to focus on supporting technologies that are vital to the world reaching net-zero emissions but are currently too expensive to be adopted at scale. By coordinating investments and directing them toward these critical technologies, we can reduce their Green Premiums and help them get to market faster, so we can all reach our climate goals.”  ArcelorMittal recently published its second group climate action report in which it announced a 2030 global CO2e intensity reduction target of 25% and increased its European 2030 CO2e intensity reduction target to 35%. The Company had previously, in September 2020, announced its ambition to reach net zero by 2050. The report outlined the five key levers – steelmaking transformation, energy transformation, increased use of scrap, sourcing clean electricity and offsetting residual emissions – identified as the stepping stones to achieving net zero by 2050. It also detailed several of the projects the Company is undertaking to reach its 2030 reduction target. These include plans to create the world’s first zero carbon emissions steel plant in Sestao, Spain and convert its Canadian flat steel operations to DRI-EAF steelmaking through a CAD$1.8 billion investment which will reduce CO2 emissions by 60%.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal joins Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst program as anchor partner","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"$100 million equity investment to be made over five years through XCarb™ innovation fund","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-joins-breakthrough-energy-s-catalyst-program-as-anchor-partner\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6588,"text":"ArcelorMittal announces that it has signed a letter of intent with the Governments of Belgium and Flanders, supporting a €1.1 billion project to build a 2.5 million-tonne direct reduced iron (DRI) plant at its site in Gent, as well as two new electric furnaces.  A DRI plant uses natural gas, and potentially hydrogen, instead of coal to reduce iron ore, resulting in a large reduction in CO2 emissions compared with blast furnace ironmaking. The two electric furnaces will melt the DRI and scrap steel, which will then be transformed in the steel shop into steel slabs and then further processed into finished products.  Once the DRI and electric furnaces are built, there will be a transition period during which production will move gradually from blast furnace A, to the DRI and electric furnaces, after which blast furnace A will be closed as it reaches the end of its life. By 2030, this will result in a reduction of around three million tonnes of CO2 emissions each year.  The support of both the national and the Flanders governments in this project is crucial given the significant cost associated with the transition to carbon-neutral steelmaking.  Approval from the European Commission for the funding support will also be required.  Smart Carbon and DRI synergies   The DRI plant will operate alongside Gent’s blast furnace B, which restarted production in March 2021 following a significant investment of €195 million.  Various decarbonisation initiatives, including the commissioning in 2022 of Gent’s Steelanol\/Carbalyst and Torero projects will see annual CO2 emissions reduction of 0.9 million tonnes by 2030.  The combination of the new DRI plant alongside a sustainable, state-of-the-art blast furnace enables the creation of unique synergies in ArcelorMittal Belgium’s roadmap to climate-neutral steelmaking.  Combined, the various initiatives will enable ArcelorMittal Belgium to reduce its CO2 emissions by 3.9 million tonnes per year by 2030 (on a scope 1 and 2 basis, compared with 2018), which is equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 848,172 cars being driven for a year[1]. As a result, ArcelorMittal Belgium will make a significant contribution to ArcelorMittal Europe’s ambition to reduce CO2e emissions intensity by 35% by 2030 and to become carbon neutral by 2050.  Roadmap to 2050  The hybrid model approach of Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI steelmaking in Gent fits into ArcelorMittal Belgium’s CO2 roadmap which consists of three axes:    * Further improvement of material and energy efficiency as well as increased scrap usage   * The implementation of Smart Carbon technologies:     1. Replacing fossil carbon with circular and waste carbon: 'Fresh' raw materials will increasingly be replaced with waste products, in an environmentally and economically feasible way. The Torero project will pre-treat waste wood from container parks to produce bio-coal suitable for the blast furnace process. ArcelorMittal Belgium also has demonstration projects running with plastic waste that could be injected into the blast furnaces in the form of powder or gas.   2. Reforming waste gas into useful chemical compounds: In 2022, ArcelorMittal Belgium will commission a plant (Steelanol\/Carbalyst) to biologically convert gas from the steelmaking process into bioethanol.   3. Separating CO2 for reuse or storage.     * Hydrogen: replacing carbon as a reductant, with hydrogen (ultimately green hydrogen, when it is available commercially).    Alexander De Croo, Prime Minister of Belgium, said:  “To tackle the climate crisis, we need ambitious action. European countries are leading the way, with clear targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. It is good to see that sectors with a large footprint are also joining the race by investing in innovation that reduces emissions and, in the long term, achieves carbon neutrality. This major investment in new technology by ArcelorMittal is important for the wider Ghent region, for reducing our country's footprint, and shows that decarbonising our economy is a joint effort.”  Jan Jambon, Flemish Minister-President, said:  “We believe that technological breakthroughs are key in delivering on the climate agenda. The ambitious roadmap brought forward by ArcelorMittal for its site in Ghent is in that sense an opportunity.”  Vincent Van Peteghem, Deputy Prime Minister of the Belgian Government and Belgian Minister of Finance, said:  “In order for us to enable climate transition for a better, healthier tomorrow it is crucial for government and industry to come together in this crucial pivoting point in time. ArcelorMittal is proving to be a leading example for this transition in our region. This joint effort is not only securing the presence of ArcelorMittal in our region but is also quintessential in lending the Ghent region healthy & clean air for all.”  Hilde Crevits, Deputy Prime Minister of the Flemish Government and Flemish Minister for Economy, Innovation, Work, Social Economy and Agriculture, said:  “ArcelorMittal has chosen a ground-breaking and innovative technology that will significantly reduce emissions from one of their blast furnaces, resulting in a 4% reduction of emissions in Flanders. This unique project will serve as an example to the rest of Europe on how to realise the goal of climate neutrality. Simultaneously, it ensures the sustainable creation of jobs and strengthens ArcelorMittal's competitiveness, to the benefit of Flanders’ welfare and prosperity.”  Tinne Van der Straeten, Belgian Minster of Energy, said:  “This ambitious project shows that industry is a crucial partner to achieve a climate neutral society by 2050. It will be one of the largest climate investments in Belgium that will anchor ArcelorMittal in the Ghent region, that guarantees employment and that will provide low carbon and ultimately carbon neutral steel. Green steels is needed in the switch to 100% renewable energy. What is good for the climate is good for the economy and for everyone.”  Matthias Diependaele, Flemish Minister of Finance and Budget, Housing and Immovable Heritage, said:  “This investment for ArcelorMittal's infrastructure is a sign of responsible Flemish policy. We are investing in a sustainable future for the country, both in terms of emissions and in securing employment in the port of Ghent.”  Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Today’s announcement is the third major decarbonisation project we have announced in the past two months, demonstrating how we are taking firm steps to decarbonise our operations and crucially, to accelerate progress in the decade ahead. None of these projects would be possible without government backing, so we are very grateful to the governments of Belgium and Flanders for their ongoing support as we transition to net-zero steelmaking. Today’s announcement of our project to build a 2.5 million-tonne DRI plant that will co-exist with and complement the Smart Carbon pathway in which we are already investing in Gent, is an example of the kind of transformational change we want and need to implement in order to accelerate ArcelorMittal’s journey to net-zero steelmaking.”  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO, ArcelorMittal Europe, said:   “ArcelorMittal Europe recently announced a more ambitious target for reducing CO2 emissions, from a 30% to a 35% decrease by 2030. We are able to reduce our environmental impact faster, thanks to projects such as this, which embody the cooperation and innovation that we need in order to succeed. ArcelorMittal Belgium has played a vital role in the European business’ decarbonisation strategy from the outset, and as a result of today’s announcement, we will continue to see it at the forefront as we move closer to net-zero steelmaking.”   Manfred Van Vlierberghe, CEO, ArcelorMittal Belgium, said:  “ArcelorMittal Belgium has a passion for sustainability and circularity. We continue to invest and launch new projects in order to remain at the forefront of energy and climate transition. This €1.1 billion project is a major milestone in our decarbonisation journey. The DRI plant and two electric furnaces will result in a sharp decrease of CO2 emissions while the relined blast furnace will contribute to recycling waste wood and end-of-life plastics. This approach contributes to strengthening our global leadership in terms of CO2 and energy efficiency in the steel sector.”  [1] Calculated using the US EPA greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator - https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/energy\/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal signs letter of intent with the governments of Belgium and Flanders, supporting €1.1 billion investment in decarbonisation technologies at its flagship Gent plant","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Belgium will reduce CO2 emissions by 3.9 million tonnes per year by 2030, by building a 2.5 million-tonne direct reduced iron (DRI) plant and two electric furnaces at its Gent site, to operate alongside its state-of-the-art blast furnace that is ready to take waste wood and plastics as a substitute for fossil carbon.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-signs-letter-of-intent-with-the-governments-of-belgium-and-flanders-supporting-1-1-billion-investment-in-decarbonisation-technologies-at-its-flagship-gent-plant\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6593,"text":"The investment, in which the Quebec government will contribute through an electricity rebate of up to CAD$80 million, will enable the Port-Cartier plant to become one of the world’s largest producers of DRI pellets, the raw material feedstock for ironmaking in a DRI furnace. The project includes the implementation of a flotation system that will enable a significant reduction of silica in the iron ore pellets, facilitating the production of a very high-quality pellet.  The project will deliver a direct annual CO2e reduction of approximately 200,000 tonnes at AMMC’s Port-Cartier pellet plant, equivalent to over 20% of the pellet plant’s total annual CO2e emissions. This reduction in CO2e emissions will be achieved through a reduction in the energy required during the pelletising process.  A DRI plant uses natural gas to reduce iron ore, resulting in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions compared with coal-based blast furnace ironmaking. In Hamburg, Germany, ArcelorMittal is trialing replacing natural gas with hydrogen to make DRI, with its industrial scale pilot project anticipated to be commissioned before the end of 2025. The DRI installations the Company has announced it is developing in Belgium, Canada and Spain are all being constructed to be hydrogen-ready, so as and when green hydrogen is available in sufficient quantities at affordable prices the Company can produce DRI with near zero-carbon emissions.  Approximately 250 jobs are expected to be created during the construction phase of the project in Port-Cartier, which is scheduled to be begin mid-2023 and complete before the end of 2025.  Expressing the Quebec government’s support for the project, Premier François Legault said:  “With this project, the Port-Cartier plant will become one of the world's largest producers of direct reduction pellets. The market is increasingly evolving towards this technology. We are therefore ensuring that ArcelorMittal will continue to create wealth in Quebec for many years. We are positioning our regions at the heart of the green economy of tomorrow. My message to companies looking for a place to reduce their GHG emissions is come and see us. We'll help you carry out your projects promptly. Quebec is the best place in the world to invest in the green economy. To build together a greener, more prosperous and prouder Quebec.’’  Aditya Mittal, ArcelorMittal CEO, said:  “This project has an important role to play in our efforts to reduce our group’s CO2e emissions intensity by 25% by 2030, and our longer-term ambition to reach net zero by 2050. Not only does it deliver a significant reduction in our emissions at AMMC, but it also expands our ability to produce high-quality direct reduced iron pellets, which we will need in significant volumes as we transition to DRI-EAF steelmaking at our steel plants in Canada and Europe.  “I am grateful to Premier Legault and his government for the support it is providing in realising this project. It is the first significant decarbonisation project we have announced for our mining business and fitting that we are able to make this announcement at COP26 as it exemplifies the transformational change we need to deliver this decade as we move towards becoming a carbon-neutral business.”   Mapi Mobwano, CEO, ArcelorMittal Mining Canada, added:  “This investment will see us become one of the biggest direct reduction pellet producers in the world, thereby propelling ArcelorMittal Mining Canada into the forefront of mining and steel decarbonisation. From 2025 onwards we will have the capacity to produce ten million tonnes of very high-quality iron oxide pellets, with low silica content and high iron density, which will be highly strategic in the years ahead. This transformation will enable us to reduce our own current emissions by 200,000 tonnes of CO2e per year – equivalent to removing 57,600 cars from the road each year. Moreover, it will support a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of primary steelmaking. These pellets are the feedstock for DRI-EAF steelmaking, which given its significantly lower carbon footprint is expected to replace a significant amount of blast furnace capacity in the coming decades.

{"id":6597,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces it has made a US$30 million investment in carbon recycling company, LanzaTech through its XCarb™ innovation fund, the fourth investment the Company has made through the fund since its launch in March 2021.  The investment further expands ArcelorMittal’s relationship with LanzaTech, which commenced in 2015 when the Company first announced plans to utilise LanzaTech’s carbon capture and re-use technology at its plant in Ghent, Belgium. The €180 million Carbalyst® plant – ArcelorMittal’s flagship carbon capture and re-use technology project - is currently under construction, with commissioning expected before the end of 2022. Also known as the Steelanol project, funding has been obtained from various sources, including from the European Union's Horizon 2020 program, the European Investment Bank and the Belgian and Flemish governments.  Using LanzaTech’s gas fermentation technology, which captures carbon-rich waste gases from the steelmaking process and converts them into sustainable fuels and chemicals, the plant will reduce ArcelorMittal Ghent’s CO2e emissions by 125,000 tonnes a year. It will also produce 80 million litres of bio-ethanol annually, which can be blended with traditional gasoline and used as a low-carbon alternative fuel for the transport sector.  LanzaTech is also developing technology to convert captured emissions into a range of other chemical building blocks to make useful materials, such as textiles, rubber, and packaging.  Commenting, Pinakin Chaubal, chief technology officer, ArcelorMittal said:  “We have worked with LanzaTech for several years, know their leadership team well and understand the potential of their technology and the role it can play in not only helping us to decarbonise, but also in producing valuable products from our carbon bearing gases which can help the decarbonisation of other sectors. Extending our relationship through this investment was therefore a natural next step and we are very pleased to now have an excellent CCU technology company within our XCarb™ innovation fund portfolio.”   Jennifer Holmgren, CEO, LanzaTech added:  “No longer can we simply extract more resources to make the things we need. ArcelorMittal has long been a champion of the circular economy and through their XCarb™ innovation fund they are helping create a new circular carbon economy. We are delighted to deepen our relationship with ArcelorMittal and look forward to this next chapter as we create a future where everything can be made from recycled carbon.”  Previous investments the Company has made through its XCarb™ innovation fund include: US$10 million in Heliogen, a renewable energy technology company that focuses on ‘unlocking the power of sunlight to replace fossil fuels’; US$25 million in Form Energy, which is developing a breakthrough low-cost iron-air battery storage technology; and a commitment of US$100 million over five years in Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst program, an initiative Bill Gates founded to scale the technologies the world needs to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal expands partnership with carbon capture and re-use specialist LanzaTech through US$30 million investment","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Investment is ArcelorMittal’s fourth via its XCarb™ innovation fund","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-expands-partnership-with-carbon-capture-and-re-use-specialist-lanzatech-through-us-30-million-investment\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":6605,"text":"The Prime Minister announced support from the French Government for ArcelorMittal’s decarbonisation programme in France, which involves a €1.7 billion investment in its Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk sites in France. This investment will enable a profound transformation of steelmaking in France and a total reduction of close to 40% or 7.8 million tonnes per year in ArcelorMittal’s CO2 emissions in France by 2030. This transformation will represent a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing industry in France and put France’s steelmaking industry on the path of the Paris Agreement.  The transformation of steelmaking operations will generate positive and sustainable dynamics for employment and industrial activity in France, especially in the Dunkirk and Fos-sur-Mer areas.  ArcelorMittal will implement €1.7 billion of investments by 2030 to accelerate the decarbonisation of its steelmaking sites in Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk while maintaining equivalent production capacities:    * In Fos-sur-Mer, ArcelorMittal will build an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). This new unit will complement the ladle furnace announced last March and supported by France’s recovery plan, ‘France Relance’. Together these investments will turn Fos-sur-Mer into a reference site for the production of low carbon, circular steel, made from recycled steel;   * In Dunkirk, ArcelorMittal will build a 2.5 million tonne Direct Reduction of Iron (DRI) unit to transform iron ore using hydrogen instead of coal. This DRI will be coupled with an innovative technology electric furnace and completed by an additional Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). Other investments are already under way to continue to increase the proportion of scrap steel used.    The new industrial facilities will be operational starting in 2027 and will gradually replace 3 out of 5 of ArcelorMittal’s blast furnaces in France by 2030 (2 out of 3 in Dunkirk, 1 out of 2 in Fos).  Decarbonising the Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk sites will contribute to maintaining and developing the French steelmaking industry. It will also support the strengthening and development of local ecosystems, generating positive and sustainable dynamics for employment and industrial activity in France, especially in the Dunkirk and Fos-sur-Mer areas.  Commenting, Eric Niedziela, Chairman of ArcelorMittal France and Vice President Climate Action ArcelorMittal Europe, said:  “ArcelorMittal is honored that the French State supports our projects. We are proud to have this unique opportunity to contribute to the objectives of the France 2030 plan and to maintaining a strong manufacturing industry in France, serving European markets. ArcelorMittal’s management team and its 15,500 employees in France are mobilised to succeed in this new industrial revolution and we will be happy to welcome new talents willing to participate in this extraordinary adventure.”  Yves Koeberlé, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, added:  “As a leader in steelmaking, ArcelorMittal is committed to decarbonising its plants in Europe to serve our industrial customers – automotive, packaging, construction, transport but also solar and wind energy and future networks for hydrogen and CO2 capture. We are grateful for this support from the French State which will enable the major transformation of our sites in Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk which together account for over one-third of ArcelorMittal’s flat steel production in Europe.”  Matthieu Jehl, CEO of ArcelorMittal France, said:  “This support makes possible the extremely high investments we need to make to decarbonise steelmaking on our Dunkirk site, Europe’s largest steel producing site. We will therefore continue transforming our sites in France to deliver our customers with low carbon steel.”   Bruno Ribo, CEO of ArcelorMittal Méditerranée, said:  “Our Fos-sur-Mer site will undergo a first-of-a-kind transformation to decarbonize. Our teams are already implementing a first investment – our ladle furnace – which will increase our production of low carbon steel. We are ready to continue.”  ArcelorMittal’s French operations have already started working on a second step in their decarbonisation programme, which will use the technologies implemented during the first step, along with carbon capture and storage or utilisation (CCU\/S) technologies, assuming the technology sufficiently matures and regulation ensures it economic viability. This second step will enable ArcelorMittal’s French operations to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.  The partnership between ArcelorMittal and the French government for the projects is subject to EU approval, which is anticipated by the second quarter of this year, as well as the availability of economically viable energy infrastructure and supply.  Decarbonising ArcelorMittal’s operations in France: three ways to carbon neutrality  ArcelorMittal plays its part in the fight against climate change and has set ambitious objectives: a 35% reduction in CO2 emissions in Europe and a -25% reduction globally by 2030; and carbon neutrality by 2050.  To do this, ArcelorMittal will change completely the way it produces steel, by:  ✅ Increasing the recycling of steel: one kilo of steel produced by ArcelorMittal in France will soon contain up to 25% recycled steel  ✅ Developing innovative DRI, to make steel without coal, with hydrogen  ✅ Capturing residual CO2 for storage or usage (CCU\/S).","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2022-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal accelerates its decarbonisation with a €1.7 billion investment programme in France, supported by the French Government","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Visiting the ArcelorMittal site in Dunkirk, France, today, French Prime Minister Jean Castex, Minister of Ecological Transition Barbara Pompili, and Minister of Industry Agnès Pannier-Runacher were welcomed by Eric Niedziela, Chairman of ArcelorMittal France and Vice President Climate Action ArcelorMittal Europe, Matthieu Jehl, CEO of ArcelorMittal France, Bruno Ribo, CEO of ArcelorMittal Méditerranée, and Yves Koeberlé, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-accelerates-its-decarbonisation-with-a-1-7-billion-investment-programme-in-france-supported-by-the-french-government\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":6608,"text":"ArcelorMittal (the ‘Company’) has today confirmed with the Government of Ontario its plan for a c. CAD$1.8 billion investment in decarbonisation technologies at ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton. As announced in July, 2021, the investment will reduce annual CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal’s Hamilton, Ontario operations by approximately 3 million tonnes, which represents approximately 60% of emissions. This means the Hamilton plant will transition away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) – Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint.  The project is scheduled to be complete by 2028, although the Company is looking for opportunities to accelerate the project timelines.  The new manufacturing processes contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions and deliver other positive environmental impacts including the elimination of emissions and flaring from coke making and ironmaking operations.  The investment was contingent on support from the governments of Canada and Ontario. In July 2021 the Government of Canada announced it will invest CAD$400 million in the project and today, the Government of Ontario announced it will invest CAD$500 million in the project. This secures project funding and firms up the investment.  Today’s announcement was made at an event in ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton, which was attended by ArcelorMittal North America CEO John Brett, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, Minister of Economic Development Job Creation and Trade Vic Fedeli, Minister of Energy Todd Smith and MPP Donna Skelly.  At the heart of the plan is a 2.5 million tonne capacity DRI facility and an EAF facility capable of producing 2.4 million tonnes of high-quality steel through its existing secondary metallurgy and secondary casting facilities. Modification of the existing EAF facility and continuous casters will also be undertaken to align productivity, quality and energy capabilities between all assets in the new footprint.  This project contributes to the sustainability of well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing and is also expected to support as many as 2,500 jobs during the engineering and construction phases. It will also support ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s customers decarbonisation ambitions while further enhancing ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s capability to support the most demanding product segments including automotive exposed, advanced high strength steels, and consumer packing.  This new production route for ArcelorMittal Dofasco will provide a technically advanced manufacturing environment for operations, maintenance, and technology staff to work in, with improved health and safety. New positions, training, and development will be provided for employees moving from existing business units to new assets, with approximately 160,000 training hours required to transition our workforce to the new footprint.  Announcing the investment, Vic Fedeli, Minster of Economic Development Job Creation and Trade said:  “From day one, our government’s plan has been to unleash Ontario’s economic potential by reducing the cost of doing business in Ontario by nearly $7 billion a year. This once-in-a-generation investment to transform the province into a world-leading producer of green steel is a major step forward as we strive for a full economic recovery and transform our auto supply chains to build the car of the future – right here in Ontario.”  Speaking at the announcement in Hamilton, John Brett, ArcelorMittal North America CEO, said:  “Reducing our CO2 emissions intensity worldwide by 25% by 2030 is an ambitious target for a steel and mining company; but we believe it is achievable and that it is our responsibility to invent or innovate the processes and technologies that will enable us to reach that goal. As part of that, we understand that in the coming years, the assets used to make steel will undergo a transformation on a scale not seen for many decades.”  Highlighting the impact of the announcement, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard said:  “This is the most significant construction project ever undertaken at Dofasco. And the most important achievement in the project timeline will be that everyone working on site is working safely and returning home to their family unharmed.  “All options for the newest, most advanced technology that achieves maximum carbon reduction for steelmaking, enhanced product capability and quality, and advanced manufacturing employment opportunities were explored. Extensive benchmarking and modelling were also completed in preparing the ultimate plan for the sustainability of the environment, the company, employees, customers, and the community.”  In addition to Canada, the Company has also announced investments in decarbonisation technologies in Belgium, France and Spain. Combined investment for the four projects totals US$5.6 billion, with anticipated carbon emissions reduction totalling 19.5 million tonnes, which is equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 4,240,858 cars being driven for a year[1]. These projects sit at the heart of the Company’s target to reduce its CO2e emissions intensity by 25% by 2030 group-wide, and in Europe by 35% by 2030.

{"id":6616,"text":"ArcelorMittal (the ‘Company’) today announces it has established a strategic partnership with Greenko Group, India’s leading energy transition company, to develop a ‘round the clock’ renewable energy project with 975 MW of nominal capacity.   The c. $0.6 billion project will combine solar and wind power and be supported by Greenko’s hydro pumped storage project, which helps to overcome the intermittent nature of wind and solar power generation.  The project will be owned and funded by ArcelorMittal. Greenko will design, construct and operate the renewable energy facilities in Andhra Pradesh, Southern India. Project commissioning is expected by mid-2024.  ArcelorMittal’s joint venture company in India, ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM\/NS India), will enter into a 25 year off-take agreement with ArcelorMittal to purchase 250 MW of renewable electricity annually from the project. This will result in over 20% of the electricity requirement at AM\/NS India’s Hazira plant coming from renewable sources, reducing carbon emissions by approximately 1.5 million tonnes per year.  The project offers AM\/NS India the dual benefits of lower electricity costs and lower CO2 emissions, and it also provides an attractive return on investment for ArcelorMittal.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “This is an attractive opportunity for ArcelorMittal. We will be partnering with a highly experienced energy transition company in a project that will enable our joint venture company AM\/NS India to reduce both its electricity costs and carbon emissions, as well as providing consistent, guaranteed returns for ArcelorMittal.  “Large amounts of green energy are one of the key foundations for both a net zero economy and a decarbonised steel industry.

{"id":6620,"text":"The state-of-the-art plant, which was opened in October 2016, is one of the largest of its kind in the world. It has an annual capacity of two million tonnes of HBI, a high-quality feedstock made through the direct reduction of iron ore which is used to produce high-quality steel grades in an electric arc furnace (‘EAF’), but which can also be used in blast furnaces, resulting in lower coke consumption. HBI is a premium, compacted form of Direct Reduced Iron (‘DRI’) developed to overcome issues associated with shipping and handling DRI.  In parallel with the transaction, ArcelorMittal has signed a long-term offtake agreement with voestalpine to supply an annual volume of HBI commensurate to voestalpine’s equity stake to its steel mills in Donawitz and Linz, Austria. The remaining balance of production will be delivered to third parties under existing supply contracts, and to ArcelorMittal facilities, including to AM\/NS Calvert in Alabama, upon the commissioning of its 1.5 million tonne EAF, expected in the second half of 2023.  Commenting, ArcelorMittal CEO, Aditya Mittal, said:  “This is a compelling strategic acquisition for our company. It accelerates both our progression into producing high-quality metallic feedstock for EAFs and our global decarbonisation journey. The facility is world-class and is ideally located, with its own deep-water port. There is also unused land on the site which provides interesting options for further development.  “ArcelorMittal is already one of the world’s largest producers of DRI. This acquisition will further strengthen our position and guarantee security of supply to AM\/NS Calvert, while our experience will bring significant value to the asset. DRI is a feedstock which has a very important role to play in our decarbonisation ambitions, as we have announced plans to construct DRI facilities at several sites across Europe and in Canada. Today’s transaction therefore represents an important further step in our climate action journey. Finally, I would like to thank the executive management team at voestalpine and look forward to developing a strong partnership with them.”  The Corpus Christi facility, which covers an area of two square kilometers and employs over 270 people, is located in an optimal coastal position with direct access to a broad and deep shipping channel which enables cost effective transportation to the Americas and Europe. It incorporates best-in-class technology and equipment supplied by MIDREX Technologies Inc., a leading supplier of DRI solutions. It currently uses natural gas to directly reduce iron ore pellets into HBI with an Fe content which exceeds 91%. However, the plant does have the potential to transition to 100% hydrogen, with the Texas coast presenting advantageous weather conditions to produce renewable energy powered green hydrogen. The use of natural gas rather than coal as the current energy input and reductant means that DRI-EAF steelmaking carries a significantly lower carbon footprint than blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking. DRI\/HBI is therefore expected to play a prominent role in the decarbonisation of the steel industry, a process ArcelorMittal intends to lead.  ArcelorMittal is a world leader in DRI production, with c. nine million tonnes of annual production capacity (c. 15 million tonnes including AM\/NS India). DRI – ultimately produced using green hydrogen – sits at the heart of the Company’s Innovative-DRI steelmaking pathway, one of two pathways ArcelorMittal has developed which hold the potential to deliver carbon-neutral steelmaking.  Over the past year, the Company has accelerated its Innovative-DRI strategy, announcing projects to construct additional DRI and EAF capacity at its operations in Belgium, Canada, France and Spain. The combined investment for the four projects totals US$5.6 billion, with anticipated carbon emissions reduction totalling 19.5 million tonnes, which is [1]equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 4,240,858 cars being driven for a year. These projects sit at the heart of the company’s target to reduce its CO2e emissions intensity by 25% by 2030 group-wide, and in Europe by 35% by 2030.

The deal involves 10 scrap yards located in the south of Germany, across three different companies, ALBA Electronics Recycling, ALBA Metall Süd Rhein-Main and ALBA Metall Süd. Together, these companies process approximately 400,000 tonnes of material annually, the majority of which is steel scrap. The companies source material from a broad range of suppliers, contracts with municipalities and via contracts with industrial clients from a range of manufacturing sectors. The companies ship processed metal scrap and other materials to metal producers and other participants in the circular economy.  Commenting, Geert Van Poelvoorde, ArcelorMittal Europe CEO, said:  “Increasing the use of scrap in our steelmaking operations and securing access to the metallics required for low-carbon steelmaking is one component of our plans to reduce our CO2e emissions intensity by 35 per cent by 2030. I am therefore very pleased to welcome the management teams and employees of all three companies to ArcelorMittal. The management teams will stay in place and we look forward to working closely with our new colleagues to utilise their market knowledge and expertise to enable Alba to capture the strong growth potential which resides in their business, and support our ambition to lead our industry’s efforts to decarbonise.”   This is the second steel scrap acquisition ArcelorMittal has made recently. It follows the acquisition of John Lawrie Metals Ltd., a leading consolidator of ferrous scrap metal based in Scotland, in March 2022.  In its second Climate Action report, published in July last year, ArcelorMittal outlined five levers which will enable the Company to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050, one of which was increased use of scrap steel. As well as using scrap in an electric arc furnace, we can increase the use of low-quality scrap in the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking process by improving steel scrap sorting and classification, installing scrap pre-melting technology and adjusting the steelmaking process to accommodate scrap.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal acquires German steel scrap recycling businesses from Alba International Recycling","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal today announces it has acquired several steel scrap recycling facilities from environmental services and recycling company ALBA International Recycling.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-acquires-german-steel-scrap-recycling-businesses-from-alba-international-recycling\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

ExxonMobil plans to invest $3 billion on lower emission energy solutions through 2025. The business will be led by Joe Blommaert, who has more than 30 years of experience in the industry with leadership roles in technology advancement, product marketing, and operations. The board of directors has elected him as a vice president of Exxon Mobil Corporation.  \n  \nCCS is the process of capturing CO2 that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere from industrial activity, and injecting it into deep geologic formations for safe, secure and permanent storage. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency agree that CCS is one of the most important low-carbon technologies required to achieve societal climate goals at the lowest cost. CCS is also one of the only technologies that could enable some industry sectors to decarbonize, including the refining, chemicals, cement and steel sectors.  \n  \nExxonMobil has more than 30 years of experience in CCS technology and was the first company to capture more than 120 million tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to the emissions of more than 25 million cars for one year. The company has an equity share in about one-fifth of global CO2 capture capacity and has captured approximately 40 percent of all the captured anthropogenic CO2 in the world.  \n  \nExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions will also leverage ExxonMobil’s significant experience in the production of hydrogen which, when coupled with CCS, is likely to play a critical role in a lower-carbon energy system.

Analysis indicates the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a liquid fuel. The fuel will be tested in race conditions with Porsche’s high-performance motorsports engines during the 2021 Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup race series.   \n  \nPorsche and ExxonMobil’s collaboration will also focus on eFuels, which are synthetic fuels made from hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide. As early as 2022, the companies plan to test the second iteration of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel, which will contain eFuel components. The eFuel is anticipated to achieve a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of up to 85 percent, when blended to current market fuel standards for today’s passenger vehicles.i  \n  \n“The electrification of our vehicles is of highest priority to us,” said Michael Steiner, Member of the Executive Board, Research and Development of Porsche. “eFuels are a good complement to our powertrain strategy. They allow our customers to drive cars with conventional combustion engines as well as plug-in hybrids with significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions. The collaboration with ExxonMobil enables us to test the eFuels under demanding conditions on the racing track. This is a further step towards making eFuels an affordable and lower greenhouse gas emission substitute to conventional fuels.”  \n  \nThe eFuel will be sourced from the Haru Oni pilot plant based in Chile that generates hydrogen, which is then combined with captured carbon dioxide drawn from the atmosphere to produce methanol. ExxonMobil is providing a license and support for the proprietary technology to convert the methanol to gasoline, which will result in a lower-carbon fuel.   \n  \nIn the pilot phase, around 35,000 gallons of eFuels will be produced in 2022. As the fuel’s primary user, Porsche will use the eFuels from Chile among others in the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup starting in the season of 2022.  \n  \n“Over the past quarter century, we have worked together with Porsche to develop high-performance products that support Porsche’s vehicle performance on the racetrack and on the road,” said Andy Madden, vice president of strategy and planning for ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants. “Our continued collaboration on renewable and eFuels is a critical step in assessing the technical capability and commercial viability of fuels that can significantly reduce emissions.”  \n  \nThe first on-track testing of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel is scheduled for March 30, 2021 in Zandvoort, Netherlands, and will continue throughout the 2021 and 2022 Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup race series.   \n  \nThe collaboration with Porsche builds on ExxonMobil’s continuing efforts to develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions, including high-efficiency fuels and lubricants, advanced plastics and other products that can enable cars and trucks to use less fuel. For example, the two companies have collaborated on a line of specially formulated lubricants for the electric vehicles market, Mobil EVTM range.  \n  \nIn January, ExxonMobil announced the creation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, to commercialize its extensive low-carbon technology portfolio and plans to invest $3 billion on lower emission energy solutions through 2025. Last year, ExxonMobil announced plans to distribute renewable diesel within California and potentially other domestic and international markets as soon as 2022.   \n  \nOver the past two decades, ExxonMobil has invested more than $10 billion to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions, resulting in highly efficient operations that have eliminated or avoided approximately 480 million tonnes of CO2 emissions - the equivalent of taking more than 100 million passenger vehicles off the road for a year.ii  \n  \nPorsche is committed to invest $17.9 billion in electromobility and digitalization by 2025. In 2030 the sports car manufacturer will offer more than 80 percent of its vehicles with electric engines.

A further project is underway to install an enclosed ground flare. On schedule to be operational by the end of 2022, the unit is designed to significantly reduce noise, light and vibration, and it is estimated the investment will reduce the use of the plant’s elevated flare by at least 98 percent.\nThese investments, together with ExxonMobil’s participation in the Acorn project, demonstrate a commitment to reducing emissions and to Fife’s future as a competitive asset.\nExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions is evaluating several other carbon capture and storage projects around the world, including in Rotterdam, Netherlands; Normandy, France; LaBarge, Wyoming; and a world-scale carbon capture and storage hub concept in Houston, Texas. The company has an equity share in approximately one-fifth of global CO2 capture capacity and has captured approximately 40 percent of all the captured anthropogenic CO2 in the world. \nExxonMobil established its Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize low-emission technologies. It is initially focusing its carbon capture efforts on point source emissions, the process of capturing CO2 from industrial activity that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, and injecting it into deep underground geologic formations for safe, secure and permanent storage. The business is also pursuing strategic investments in biofuels and hydrogen to bring those lower-emissions energy technologies to scale for hard-to-decarbonize sectors of the global economy.\nThe International Energy Agency projects that carbon capture and storage could mitigate up to 15% of global emissions by 2040, and the U.N.

First-quarter results included an unfavorable identified item of $3.4 billion associated with our planned exit from Russia Sakhalin-1, or $0.79 per share assuming dilution. First-quarter capital and exploration expenditures were $4.9 billion. \n  * Earned $5.5 billion in first quarter 2022; generated $14.8 billion of cash flow from operating activities, more than covering capital investment and shareholder distributions \n  * Earnings excluding identified items were $8.8 billion, an increase of more than $6 billion versus the first quarter of 2021, after adjusting for a $3.4 billion after-tax charge related to the company's Russia Sakhalin-1 operation\n  * Announced increase in share repurchase program up to a total of $30 billion through 2023\n  * Achieved first oil at the Liza Phase 2 development in Guyana; Payara FPSO construction approximately five months ahead of schedule with start-up likely before year-end 2023; announced five new discoveries, increasing the estimated recoverable resource base for the Stabroek block to nearly 11 billion oil-equivalent barrels\n  * Progressed significant lower-emission opportunities, including plans for a world-scale blue hydrogen plant supported by one of the world's largest carbon capture and storage projects in Baytown, Texas, and received top certification for methane emission management at Poker Lake in the Permian Basin\n  * Effective April 1, to further capture benefits of technology, scale, and integration, the corporation formed ExxonMobil Product Solutions, combining world-scale Downstream and Chemical businesses, and centralized Technology & Engineering and Operations & Sustainability groups\nOil-equivalent production was 3.7 million barrels per day, down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2021 due to weather-related unscheduled downtime, planned maintenance, lower entitlements associated with higher prices, and divestments. Excluding entitlement effects, government mandates, and divestments, oil-equivalent production was down 2%.  \n  \n“The quarter illustrated the strength of our underlying business and significant progress in further developing our competitively advantaged production portfolio,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “Earnings increased modestly, as strong margin improvement and underlying growth was offset by weather and timing impacts. The absence of these temporary impacts in March provides strong, positive momentum for the second quarter.”\n Financial Highlights\n  * First-quarter earnings of $5.5 billion compared with $8.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding identified items, earnings of $8.8 billion were slightly higher than the prior quarter, as higher industry prices and margins and reduced expenses were largely offset by a temporary reduction in volumes, unfavorable mark-to-market derivative effects, and price timing impacts. \n  * First-quarter cash increased by $4.3 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, as strong cash flow from operations more than funded capital investment, additional debt reduction, and shareholder distributions in the quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $11 billion.\n  * With the balance sheet well within the targeted debt-to-capital range of 20-25%, the company initiated its previously announced $10 billion buyback program, repurchasing shares totaling $2.1 billion during the quarter. The company has increased this program and now expects to repurchase up to a total of $30 billion through 2023.\n  * Effective April 1, to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to better serve our customers, the corporation formed ExxonMobil Product Solutions, combining world-scale Downstream and Chemical businesses, and centralized Technology & Engineering and Operations & Sustainability groups.

The new centralized organizations will fully leverage functional expertise and quickly deploy best practices across the globe.\n Leading the Drive to Net Zero\n  * In January, ExxonMobil announced its ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from operated assets by 2050. This ambition applies to Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions and builds on the company’s 2030 emission-reduction plans. \n  * The company reached a final investment decision to expand carbon capture capacity at its facility in LaBarge, Wyoming, adding up to 1.2 million metric tons to the nearly 7 million metric tons already captured at LaBarge each year. \n  * ExxonMobil announced plans for its first world-scale blue hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas. The proposed plant would produce up to 1 billion cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen and include one of the world’s largest carbon capture and storage projects, doubling the company’s industry-leading carbon capture capacity and providing a potential anchor for the ambitious Houston Industrial Hub emissions reduction project.\n  * The company advanced several renewable fuel initiatives, including planned renewable diesel production through an equity investment in Global Clean Energy Holdings. In partnership with Neste, the company also agreed to deliver sustainable aviation fuel to Virgin Atlantic and Singapore Airlines. \n  * Earlier this month, ExxonMobil began selling commercial volumes of certified natural gas after MiQ, an independent validator, certified the company’s assets in the Permian Basin with an \"A\" grade – the highest recognition possible – for its methane and emissions-reduction processes and technology applications. The company plans to expand the certification process to other operations in the United States.\n  * The company recently announced that Dan Ammann has been appointed president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, effective May 1. Ammann previously served as president and CEO of General Motors’ Cruise autonomous vehicle company\n Earnings and volume summary by segment\n  * First-quarter 2022 Upstream earnings of $4.5 billion compared with $6.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding identified items, earnings were $7.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from the previous quarter, primarily due to higher liquids prices and lower expenses, partly offset by lower volumes driven by weather-related impacts, fewer days in the quarter, price entitlement effects, and divestments. Average realizations for crude oil increased 28%. \n  * Oil-equivalent production in the first quarter was 3.7 million barrels per day. Excluding entitlement effects, divestments, and government mandates, oil-equivalent production decreased 2% versus the fourth quarter 2021. Liquids volumes were down 119,000 barrels per day, while natural gas volumes were down 132 million cubic feet per day. By the end of the quarter, production had fully recovered from weather-related impacts.\n  * Relative to the first quarter of 2021, earnings excluding identified items increased $5.2 billion, primarily due to higher industry prices, which were partly offset by lower volumes. Average realizations for crude oil increased 68%, while natural gas realizations increased 137%. Excluding entitlement effects, divestments, and government mandates, oil-equivalent production decreased 2%. Liquids volumes were up slightly, while natural gas volumes were down 721 million cubic feet per day.\n  * The company is discontinuing operations at the Sakhalin-1 venture (“Sakhalin”). As operator of Sakhalin, the company remains focused on the safety of people, protection of the environment, and integrity of operations. In the first quarter the company recorded a charge of $3.4 billion related to its investment in the project, which is reflected as an identified item and mainly impacts the Upstream segment.\n  * The Permian Basin continued to improve efficiency and grow production, reaching production of 560,000 barrels per day at the end of the quarter. The company remains on track to deliver a production increase of 25% this year versus full-year 2021, and to eliminate routine flaring by year end.\n  * In February, the company started production at its second major development offshore Guyana. The successful start-up of the Liza Phase 2 development brought total production capacity to more than 340,000 barrels per day. In early April, ExxonMobil announced it made a final investment decision for the Yellowtail development. Yellowtail will be the company’s fourth and largest development to date in Guyana with production capacity of 250,000 barrels of oil per day. It is expected to begin production in 2025. Additionally, Payara FPSO construction is running approximately five months ahead of schedule with start-up likely before year-end 2023.\n  * ExxonMobil continued to progress its global LNG growth strategy to meet growing worldwide demand for reliable gas supply. Commissioning of the Area 4 Coral South Floating LNG project in Mozambique is underway, with first production expected this year, and the company signed the P’nyang Gas Agreement in Papua New Guinea. Additionally, construction of the Golden Pass liquefaction facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast remains on schedule.\n  * First-quarter 2022 Downstream earnings of $0.3 billion compared with $1.5 billion in fourth quarter 2021. Improved industry fuels refining margins and lower expenses were partially offset by lower basestock margins and lower volumes, driven by higher turnaround activity. Results were also impacted by unfavorable mark-to-market impacts and price timing effects that are expected to reverse or unwind over time.\n  * Global refining margins improved from the fourth quarter despite softening seasonal demand, higher natural gas prices in Europe, and lagging jet demand recovery. By the end of the first quarter, industry margins improved to levels above the 10-year range, with the tight supply \/ demand balance expected to persist. While average basestock margins declined from the prior quarter, pricing in April is catching up to rising feedstock costs.\n  * Refining throughput was lower than in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased planned maintenance activity.\n  * Compared to the first quarter of 2021, earnings excluding identified items increased $0.7 billion, primarily due to higher industry refining margins, the absence of unfavorable one-time impacts, and improved reliability.\n  * The Permian Crude Venture remains on track for phased expansion in 2023 and 2024. The project will significantly expand pipeline capacity to transport Permian crude to both the Baytown and Beaumont, Texas refineries, and includes a 250,000 barrel per day light crude processing expansion at Beaumont. Transport fuels production is expected to increase by nearly 125,000 barrels per day in 2023.\n  * First-quarter 2022 Chemical earnings of $1.4 billion compared with $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter 2021. Excluding identified items, earnings of $1.4 billion in the first quarter 2022 compared with $1.3 billion in the previous quarter. The increase was driven by lower expenses and higher volumes on improved production mix, partly offset by lower margins. \n  * Compared to the first quarter of 2021, earnings excluding identified items were down slightly as increased project and planned maintenance spend offset higher volumes.\n  * While first-quarter global industry chemical margins declined, with bottom-of-cycle conditions in Asia Pacific, ExxonMobil’s advantaged portfolio continued to capture value from its ethane feed advantage to deliver strong results.\n  * The recently completed Corpus Christi Chemical Complex is already delivering positive cash and earnings results, despite still ramping up to full production capacity.\n  * The company is progressing plans to increase its global offer of certified circular polymer with capacity to process up to 500,000 metric tons of plastic waste per year by 2026. ExxonMobil is leveraging existing assets and proprietary advanced recycling technology to increase its capacity to process a wide range of plastic waste. Operations in Baytown will be among North America’s largest advanced plastic waste recycling facilities when its expansion is complete later this year, and will have an initial planned capacity to recycle 30,000 metric tons of plastic waste per year. The company is also evaluating and progressing other opportunities in France, the Netherlands, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada, and Singapore. In the first quarter of 2022, the company announced its first commercial sale of certified circular polymer using its Exxtend™ technology for advanced recycling of plastic waste.\n  * ExxonMobil is growing high-value, performance product capacity with competitively advantaged projects. The company's new polypropylene manufacturing unit in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is expected to start up by year-end 2022. Construction of the new Vistamaxx™ performance polymer and linear alpha olefins (LAO) manufacturing units in Baytown are progressing toward a mid-2023 start-up. ExxonMobil will manufacture 10 high-purity LAO products and market this new offering under the Elevexx™ brand name. LAOs are used in a broad range of applications, including plastic packaging, high-performing engine and industrial oils, surfactants and other specialty chemicals.\n  * Corporate and Financing reported net charges of $0.7 billion in the first quarter 2022, compared with $0.6 billion in the fourth quarter 2021. Excluding an identified items charge of $0.1 billion related to Russia, net charges were essentially flat. \n  * Net charges of $0.7 billion in the first quarter 2022 compared with $0.8 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding identified items, costs declined $0.2 billion, driven by lower pension-related corporate costs. \nExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters during a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on April 29, 2022.

{"id":7319,"text":"Today, HeidelbergCement’s subsidiary Ciments Calcia presented the draft terms of its large-scale investment and reorganisation programme for several of its sites in France. The programme is in line with HeidelbergCement’s strategy to create a sustainable low-carbon and high performance business throughout the Group.  “As part of our global business excellence initiative, we intend to further optimise effectiveness, processes and structures of our French sites,” says Dr Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “We want to considerably speed up the modernisation of our plants in order to enhance our performance in France, while ensuring alignment with the goals of the Paris agreement. This is why we focus our initiatives on the main CO2-emitting plants in France.”   The programme comprises investments of around €400 million at the Ciments Calcia plants, of which nearly €300 million are earmarked for the Airvault site alone. The company intends to adapt the organisation at its French headquarters and at two of its production sites in France in the following way:    * Conversion of the plant in Gargenville (Yvelines) into a modern grinding center and shut down of the kiln system and quarry operations. This adjustment would in particular enhance the sustainability of this strategically important site, which supplies the Parisian basin via inland waterways.   * Shut down of white cement production at the Cruas (Ardèche) site. The site would be converted into an automated cement terminal for the distribution of white cement.   * Review of the organisation of headquarters in Guerville (Yvelines) and adaptation to the company’s transformation.    The reorganisation would result in the reduction of 162 jobs and creation of 20 new jobs.   HeidelbergCement is significantly pushing its ambitious climate goals.

{"id":7323,"text":"Yesterday the Norwegian parliament approved the investment in a full-scale carbon capture facility at the HeidelbergCement Norcem plant in Brevik, Norway. The Brevik carbon capture and storage (CCS) project will enable the capture of 400,000 tonnes of CO2 per year and the transportation for permanent storage, making it the first industrial-scale CCS project at a cement production plant in the world. Work on the new facility in Brevik is expected to begin immediately, with the goal of starting CO2 separation from the cement production process by 2024. The end result will be a 50% cut of emissions from the cement produced at the plant.  “We are delighted about the final approval of the Norwegian parliament for our breakthrough CCS project in Norway,” says Dr Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. ”To meet national and international climate targets, CO2 separation is an important cornerstone. Our CCS project in Brevik will pave the way for our industry and other sectors.”  Giv Brantenberg, General Manager HeidelbergCement Northern Europe and Chairman of the Board of Norcem says: “HeidelbergCement highly appreciates the successful cooperation with the Norwegian authorities. The Brevik CCS project clearly shows the importance of industry and public sector to find common solutions in the fight against climate change.”   The Norwegian government had shortlisted Brevik for an industrial-scale CO2 capture trial at the beginning of 2018. In September 2019, a memorandum of understanding on the capture and storage of CO2 was signed by HeidelbergCement and the state-owned Norwegian energy Group Equinor. The project funding is largely supported by the Norwegian government as part of the Norwegian full-scale ‘Longship’ climate investment project that comprises capture, transport and storage of CO₂.       HeidelbergCement has committed itself to reduce its specific net CO2 emissions per tonne of cementitious material by 30% compared to 1990 by 2025.

{"id":7326,"text":"After very good results from the first project phase, HeidelbergCement is starting the further development and scaling-up of the LEILAC technology (Low Emissions Intensity Lime And Cement) together with the Australian technology company Calix and a European consortium. After examining different locations, it has been decided to build the LEILAC 2 demonstration installation for carbon capture at the HeidelbergCement cement plant in Hanover, Germany.  As part of LEILAC 1, a CO2 capture pilot installation with a capture capacity of 25,000 tonnes of CO2 per year was constructed at HeidelbergCement's Lixhe plant in Belgium in 2017. With LEILAC 2, an installation around four times as large will be operated in Hanover, which will capture 20% of the cement plant’s capacity, corresponding to around 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The first project design phase is to be completed by the end of June 2021, and the demonstration installation is expected to be ready by the end of 2023. Including design, construction, commissioning and extensive testing, the overall project is expected to be completed by 2025.  \"The LEILAC technology has the potential to enable the cement and lime industries to efficiently capture their process emissions on an industrial scale,\" says HeidelbergCement's Chairman of the Managing Board Dr. Dominik von Achten. \"The pilot project in Hanover is one of several promising CO2 capture technologies that we are currently testing at full speed within the HeidelbergCement Group.\"  With the patented LEILAC technology, the CO2 released during cement production can be captured in a highly pure form via a separate waste gas stream and used in another process. Like its predecessor project LEILAC 1, LEILAC 2 is based on Calix's innovative calciner technology. The project costs amount to €25 million, of with €16 million are coming from the EU research funding programme Horizon 2020 and €9 million are being provided by the partners of the project consortium. HeidelbergCement's share of this amounts to €3 million. The project in Hannover will also include preliminary investigations into the use of the captured CO2.  \"In cement production, two thirds of the CO2 emissions consist of process-related emissions that are released when heating the limestone and are therefore unavoidable. The LEILAC 1 project has already successfully demonstrated that this unavoidable process CO2 can be successfully captured and that the technology also works in practice on a larger scale,\" says Jan Theulen, Director Alternative Ressources at HeidelbergCement. Main aspects of the LEILAC 2 project are now the further scaling-up of the technology to large industrial scale, the complete integration of the process into an existing cement plant and the heat supply for the installation from renewable energies for climate-neutral CO2 capture.   HeidelbergCement has set itself the goal of reducing its CO2 emissions by 30% by 2025 compared with the reference year 1990. In order to achieve this, the Group has intensified its research in the area of CO2 emissions and is investing in several different pilot projects and technologies for the capture, utilisation and storage (CCU\/S) of CO2 emissions. HeidelbergCement is a global leader in the building materials industry in the development and application of innovative technologies for CO2 capture and utilisation. In addition to LEILAC, the company is involved in a number of other development and scaling projects – for example, in Norway in the CCS project \"Northern Lights\" or in Germany with partners from the cement industry in the CCU project \"Catch4Climate\".

{"id":7329,"text":"HeidelbergCement’s US subsidiary Lehigh Hanson and Silicon Valley-based materials technology company Fortera have announced a collaboration to implement a new type of carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technology in a pilot installation at Lehigh’s Redding California cement facility, with an expected 60% reduction in CO2 emissions per tonne of product. Both partners will construct and operate a small commercial plant where CO2 will be captured from the kiln exhaust and converted into a cementitious material. The final product will be suitable for use as a new low carbon SCM (Supplementary Cementitious Material) in the production of high-quality concrete with a lower CO2 footprint.  “We are delighted to add yet another technology to our existing portfolio of carbon capture initiatives, contributing to the circular economy”, says Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. “Carbon capture and utilisation or storage (CCU\/S) is one key lever to significantly reduce otherwise unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions in the cement industry. This is why building new partnerships towards CCU\/S and investing in breakthrough technologies are a core part of HeidelbergCement’s climate strategy.”  The product generated within the new carbon capture process at the Redding plant will be the first cementitious material produced commercially from CO2 captured directly from a cement kiln. Fortera’s proprietary recarbonation (ReCarbTM) process works by tapping into the existing feedstock and equipment at the plant, while production carries on as usual from the quarry to the kiln. Instead of then releasing CO2, the kiln exhaust is captured and mineralized into a cementitious material. The material can be co-blended with portland cement and used by ready mixed concrete producers as a Supplementary Cementitious Material (SCM) or as a cementitious binder for preformed concrete materials like bricks, blocks or precast structures.   The collaboration with Fortera aims to prove the commercial scalability, the quality of the final product, and the competitive economics of the technology.

{"id":7364,"text":"* ###### The facility is expected to go into operation in 2025 and aims to show that 20% of the CO2 process emissions of the cement plant can be captured.     * ###### The potential capture capacity is designed for 20% of the total CO2 emissions, which would correspond to around 100,000 tonnes of CO2 annually.    * ###### To minimise the use of fossil energy for carbon capture, the project will also test the use of alternative fuels and electrical energy.     The LEILAC 2 (Low Emissions Intensity Lime And Cement) carbon capture project has successfully passed its Financial Investment Decision milestone, confirming that the project can now enter the implementation phase. Together with the Australian technology company Calix and a European consortium, HeidelbergCement will proceed to build a demonstration facility integrated into HeidelbergCement’s plant in Hanover, Germany. The installation will be designed to reduce 20 % of the CO2 emissions of the cement plant’s CO2 emissions, corresponding to around 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year .   With the patented LEILAC technology, the CO2 released during cement production can be captured in a highly pure form via a separate waste gas stream and used in other processes. As minimal additional energy is needed and no chemicals are required, this happens in an especially cost-efficient way. The technology can also be retrofitted in a modular form at any scale and use any fuel or energy source, including biomass, hydrogen, or electricity – providing a ‘future proof’ solution.   “LEILAC 2 is one of several carbon capture projects we are currently pursuing at HeidelbergCement,” says Dr. Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board. “We are very pleased to advance this key technology at industrial scale at our plant in Hanover, Germany.    Once the technology has been successfully tested, we will be able to plan and install the technology for the actual permanent capture of CO2 in a second step, taking into account the site conditions in Hanover and the quality requirements for the CO2 for further use. The site is also optimally located to enable transport of the captured CO2 for further use or offshore storage.\"   HeidelbergCement aims to achieve CO2 reductions of up to 10 million tonnes by 2030 with several CCUS projects.  As part of the prior LEILAC 1 project, a CO2 capture pilot installation with a capture capacity of 25,000 tonnes of CO2 per year had been developed at HeidelbergCement's Lixhe plant in Belgium. With LEILAC 2, an installation around four times as large will be operated in Hanover. The project now enters the detailed design phase through 2022, followed by procurement and construction of the plant itself. Construction is expected in 2023, dependent on flag points over the coming months. The project scope for LEILAC 2 also includes a thorough analysis of the potential destination of the captured CO2, either for utilisation purposes or for safe geological offshore storage.  Phil Hodgson, Calix MD and CEO and Chairman of the LEILAC Executive Board: “The start of the implementation phase marks a significant milestone and further demonstrates the momentum which is building around the LEILAC project. It is testament to the strong level of collaboration which has been cultivated between the consortium partners, who have all worked together to make significant progress on this breakthrough project.”   About LEILAC  The LEILAC consortium is led by the LEILAC Group (technology provider Calix), and comprises HeidelbergCement, CEMEX, Cimpor, IKN, Lhoist, Port of Rotterdam, BGR, RBINS-GSB, CERTH, POLIMI, LEAP, and Engie. It is supported by GCCA, GCCSI, CEMBUREAU, ECRA, University of Clausthal and EuLA. The project aims to apply and demonstrate a breakthrough technology that will enable Europe’s cement and lime industries to reduce their carbon footprint significantly.

{"id":7376,"text":"* ###### HeidelbergCement and its Swedish subsidiary Cementa present positive results of a pre-feasibility study for the Slite CCS (carbon capture and storage) project    * ###### The installation at the Slite cement plant on the Swedish island of Gotland will be scaled to capture up to 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 annually, equalling 3% of the country’s total emissions     * ###### Slite CCS is the largest CCUS project yet for HeidelbergCement, and in the cement industry     HeidelbergCement and its Swedish subsidiary Cementa are stepping up their activities with one of Sweden's largest climate transition initiatives: At a press conference today, the promising results of the pre-feasibility study for a carbon capture and storage (CCS) facility at Cementa’s plant in Slite were presented. A new grant from the Swedish Energy Agency will support the next steps towards carbon-neutral cement production in Sweden by 2030.  “Just a few days ago, we published new sustainability targets, underlining the importance of CCUS as one key lever to almost halve our CO2 footprint by 2030 compared to 1990, and achieve Net Zero by 2050 at the latest,“ said Dr Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement: “Slite CCS is the largest CCUS project yet in our Group and the cement industry, and a model for what will be achievable with CCUS also beyond 2030. As this initiative contributes considerably to the climate ambitions of Sweden, and is a unique project for us in terms of scale, we are keen to make it happen.”   The Slite plant has a favorable location directly at a sea-harbor, and there are several storage solutions under development in the North Sea where Northern Lights is the most advanced today.  The installation at the Slite cement plant on the Swedish island of Gotland will be scaled to capture up to 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 annually, which corresponds to the plant’s total emissions and is equivalent to 3% of the country’s total emissions. Additionally, the use of biobased fuels in the cement production at Slite will be increased in line with HeidelbergCement’s commitment to significantly raise the share of biomass in the fuel mix. The full-scale capturing of the plant’s CO2 emissions is targeted by 2030.   In the pre-feasibility study, amine capture was found to be the most suitable technology. The implementation of the capture facility requires significant rebuilding and extension measures to the plant – a process that is starting now to meet the schedule. The power demand will also increase significantly.  “As we capture and store CO2 from the cement production, including emissions from bioenergy, we will be able to manufacture carbon-free cement for the Swedish construction industry. Regarding the project planning and execution, we will benefit greatly from our experience gained with the Brevik CCS project in Norway, which is under construction to be operational in 2024.

{"id":7770,"text":"LafargeHolcim allocates CHF 160 million to reduce carbon footprint in Europe LafargeHolcim is increasing its efforts to further improve the carbon-efficiency of its products and solutions. The objective is to reduce annual CO2 emissions in Europe by a further 15 percent like-for-like, representing 3 million tons1, by 2022. This will be achieved with an investment of CHF 160 million into advanced equipment as well as technologies to increase the use of low-carbon fuels and recycled materials in the company’s processes and products. Further funds are earmarked for the introduction of new carbon-efficient materials and services. Over the next three years, LafargeHolcim will work on more than 80 projects across 19 European countries. Marcel Cobuz, Region Head Europe: \"We are cognizant of our impact on the environment and will remain at the forefront of efforts to mitigate climate change. With this investment in Europe, we are taking a further step to become more carbon-efficient. We are not only investing to reduce CO2 in our own operations, but are also seeking the collaboration with our customers across the value-chain to improve the carbon efficiency of buildings and infrastructure throughout their lifecycle.\" One of the key levers to improve carbon-efficiency is to integrate the principle of circular economy into the cement production process by using waste materials instead of fossil fuels and primary raw materials. In 2018, LafargeHolcim repurposed 11 million tons of waste materials including 2 million tons of non-recyclable plastics that would otherwise end up in e.g. landfills creating further CO2 emissions. By stepping up its efforts in Europe the company aims at repurposing an additional 1.5 million tons of waste which would lead to avoiding 1 million tons of CO2 per year. As part of the roadmap, LafargeHolcim will also increase the use of mineral alternatives and waste materials. On average, LafargeHolcim already uses 4.5 million tons to replace clinker with by-products from other industries. It is during the production of clinker, the main component of cement, when most CO2 emissions associated with cement occur. Additional efforts to replace clinker will allow the company to increase the CO2 efficiency of its cements produced in Europe by 1 million tons. Portfolio of low-carbon solutions to be expanded across Europe. In all countries, LafargeHolcim is working on products and services to help its customers improve the carbon efficiency of buildings and infrastructure across their lifecycle. In France, for example, the company has recently launched Lafarge360, a new integrated offer that includes scoring and carbon footprint modelling enabling customers to make informed decisions around the environmental impact of their project. Furthermore, low-carbon products are designed in France, Poland and Romania for soil stabilizations ensuring a better life cycle assessment of the road structure. The company is also working on masonry cements in France and Romania with a carbon footprint that is 50 percent lower than pure cement while ensuring enhanced properties like workability or wall adhesion. With Airium LafargeHolcim has developed an innovative, safe, green, durable and affordable insulation alternative to traditional insulation. Priority countries for this solution include France, Austria, Switzerland and Poland. LafargeHolcim is a preferred building materials partner for low-carbon construction solutions. Its innovative concrete and cement products allow for CO2 savings of up to 70 percent compared to standard Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) products. The company is committed to continuous carbon intensity reduction of its portfolio, as demonstrated by its leadership position on carbon efficiency (576kg CO2 \/ ton of cementitious material in 2018) as well as an ambitious 2030 target (520kg CO2 per ton of cementitious material) aligned with the 2°C scenario of the Paris COP21 climate agreement.

LafargeHolcim’s portfolio of carbon capture projects was recently reinforced as the United States Department of Energy’s National Energy Laboratory Technology (DOE-NETL) announced that it will support the LH CO2MENT Colorado Project. This follows funding by the German government of the Westküste 100 project, which was announced in August. LafargeHolcim and consortium partners Svante Inc, Oxy Low Carbon Ventures LLC (OLCV) and Total have completed a study to assess the viability and design of a commercial-scale carbon-capture facility. With the confirmation of DOE-NETL funding, the partnership has committed to the next project phase to evaluate the feasibility of the facility designed to capture up to two million tons of CO2 per year directly from the Holcim cement plant and the natural gas-fired steam generator, which would be sequestered underground permanently by Occidental. The Westküste 100 project in Germany also received the go-ahead and funding approval from the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy in August. In this project, CO2 from the LafargeHolcim Lägerdorf plant will be transformed with green hydrogen into a synthetic fuel. The potential carbon capture capacity for the cement plant is approximately one million tons of CO2 per year. Westküste 100 (www.westkueste 100.de) is a ten-company consortium focused on the creation of low-carbon solutions and end-to-end sustainable business practices across industries. LafargeHolcim recently added to its portfolio of CCUS pilots with the ECCO2-LH project in Spain, in collaboration with Carbon Clean and Sistemas de Calor, which will capture CO2 from flue gas at its Carboneras plant and turn it to agricultural use for accelerated crop production. This will increase farm efficiency by reducing water and soil consumption ratio per kg of vegetable production. Starting with 10 of CO2 emissions from 2022, the commercial applicability of this viable CO2 circular economy business model can potentially leverage 700,000 tons of CO2 and achieve 100 decarbonization at the plant. Chief Sustainability Officer, Magali Anderson: \"Carbon capture, usage and storage will most likely play a key role in many industries' decarbonization journey. That’s why we are multiplying our pilots to test various scenarios with the ambition of reaching effective, affordable and scalable solutions. It is very encouraging to receive the support of funders such as the US and German governments, as partnering with like-minded organizations is key to scale up our impact.\" LafargeHolcim is expanding its CCUS portfolio with more than twenty projects across the US, Canada and Europe. Overall these ongoing CCUS projects could save approximately four million tons of CO2 per year. This expanding range of projects is designed to give the company maximum flexibility in applying CCUS technologies. The best solutions in terms of technology and cost efficiency could be replicated in other plants in selected regions, advancing the company’s CO2 reduction journey and adding value in the form of CO2-related materials, thereby creating new growth opportunities for the company. Working with other multinationals as well as start-ups, CCUS pilots are evaluated in terms of cost, technical feasibility, compatibility with CO2 usage opportunities and other aspects of viability and scalability. With the coordination of the LafargeHolcim Innovation Center in Lyon, the company also participates in a three-year project funded by the European Union to support the development of low-carbon energy and industry in Southern and Eastern Europe1. The company’s objective is to work from a long menu of carbon capture, usage and storage solutions, combining them in different ways and environments to assess their potential.

{"id":8429,"text":"​   \nPKN ORLEN has launched the construction of a CCGT unit at the Płock production plant. The new heat and power generation unit, with a capacity close to 600 MWe, is to be brought on stream in late 2017 or early 2018. The project’s budget is planned at PLN 1.65bn. The foundation act was signed by Piotr Chełmiński, member of the PKN ORLEN Management Board responsible for Business Development and Power and Heat Generation, and Peter Baudrexl, President of the Management Board of Siemens Sp. z o.o.  \n  \nThe CHP plant, with a state-of-the-art combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), will supply steam and electricity to the Płock Production Plant, while any surplus of electricity is to be supplied to the National Power Grid. The new unit will cogenerate heat and electricity. The advanced cogeneration technology based on natural gas, which is environmentally friendly and beneficial in terms of CO2 emissions, will be similar to the process used in the CCGT unit at Włocławek. Both units will offer high efficiency, low environmental impacts, and high utilisation rates throughout a year. 3 TWh of electricity produced at Płock will be sold to external customers in Poland, while steam will be used entirely by ORLEN Group’s production facilities and by local customers.  \n  \n”Our industrial heat and power generation projects based on natural gas will, first and foremost, markedly enhance the operational excellence of our downstream segment, which comprises refinery and petrochemical production, sale of fuels and petrochemical products, as well as sale of energy and heat. Gas-fired cogeneration brings climate-related benefits and is, to a large extent, environmentally neutral, which remains one of our top priorities. I do believe that our projects are not only an optimum solution in every respect for the ORLEN Group, but also boost Poland’s energy security and support the development of the regions in which we operate. A maximum of 700-1,000 people, mainly subcontractors, will be working on each construction site in the peak period”, said Piotr Chełmiński, member of the PKN ORLEN Management Board responsible for Business Development and Power and Heat Generation.  \n  \nPKN ORLEN signed a contract for the turn-key delivery of a CCGT unit with the Siemens consortium, in Płock in late 2014. The parties also entered into a comprehensive O&M contract for the unit’s key equipment, covering a period of approximately twelve years from the launch of the CHP plant.   \n  \nTo date, PKN ORLEN has secured most of the permits required for the Płock project, including a network connection agreement with Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne and Gaz-System. At the end of July, the final rotor alignment test was successfully completed for the gas turbine at the Siemens factory in Berlin. The heart of the Płock CHP plant, a nearly 400-tonne gas turbine, will be shipped to Płock by sea and then up the Vistula river. In 2016, it will be connected to the steam turbine and the generator to form a powertrain. The turbine, offering generation efficiency of more than 60%, will burn gas at the temperature exceeding 1,500°C, with very low environmental emissions. The Płock CCGT unit will use H-technology, which is the most efficient power generation technology currently available worldwide, and will be the first unit of its kind in Central Europe excluding Germany. The staffing process will be completed in early 2017, and training and preparation programmes are planned for 2018. The personnel will work on the project from the commissioning of the unit.   \n  \nPKN ORLEN’s refinery and petrochemical complex at Płock currently includes a CHP plant which generates heat and power in high-efficiency cogeneration, using heavy fuel oil and gas to generate steam in boilers. The Płock unit is the largest industrial facility of its kind in Poland and one of the largest in Europe. It supplies power to PKN ORLEN’s key production plant and heat to the town of Płock, offering total electric power generation capacity of 345 MWe and thermal capacity of 2,149 MWt. A comprehensive programme designed to ensure that the existing CHP plant complies with environmental standards which will come into effect as of 2016 is nearing completion. After the new CCGT unit is brought on stream, both units will run in parallel to substantially increase operational flexibility and security of steam and electricity supplies to the Płock plant and to external customers.  \n  \nThe investment projects at PKN ORLEN are designed to enhance the Company’s power and heat generation potential. The current total installed capacity at PKN ORLEN’s generating assets in Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania is more than 760 MW for electrical power and nearly 5,000 MW for heat. With the two new projects in operation, installed capacity will increase by 1,060 MW and 630 MW, respectively.   \n\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2015-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ORLEN to build Poland’s largest gas-fired CHP plant","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"​ PKN ORLEN has launched the construction of a CCGT unit at the Płock production plant.

They are integrated with existing infrastructure, which allows us to maximise synergies while optimising capital expenditure,” said Wojciech Jasiński, President of the Management Board of PKN ORLEN.\n\nClose proximity to the GAZ-SYSTEM network and the PSE power grid make for an advantageous location of the new CCGT unit in Włocławek. The first gas power plant was built for PKN ORLEN by a consortium of General Electric and SNC-LAVALIN POLSKA. To keep its power train fully operational, PKN ORLEN has entered into a long-term servicing contract with General Electric. Upon completion of the investment phase, PKN ORLEN and the general contractor will enter into negotiations regarding financial settlements of the project.\n\nThe CCGT unit in Włocławek is one of PKN ORLEN’s two key cogeneration projects, the other one still being developed in Płock. Electricity produced by the two CCGT units in the high-efficiency cogeneration process will be used for the ORLEN Group’s in-house needs and sold in the domestic market. The Włocławek and Płock plants are industrial power projects tailored to the ORLEN Group’s needs, greatly enhancing the operational excellence of its Downstream business.\n\nThrough these projects, PKN ORLEN is gradually building up its power and heat generation potential. The Włocławek project having been completed, the total installed capacities of PKN ORLEN’s generation assets in Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania have come to 800 MWe for electrical power and nearly 4.6 GWt for heat. With the completion of the Płock project, the electrical power and heat generation capacities will increase by another 600 MWe and 530 MWt, respectively.\n\nThe Company’s energy projects are not focused solely on improving the efficiency of its Downstream business. PKN ORLEN is also working to increase the energy self-sufficiency of its service stations. It is now analysing the results of pilot photovoltaic solar energy projects implemented at PKN ORLEN facilities. A project is also under way, although still in its preliminary stages, to deploy wind turbines and energy storage banks at service stations, expected to take ORLEN’s innovative technology solutions to the next level.  \n\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2017-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ORLEN completes the Włocławek CCGT project","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"It took over 18,000 m3 of concrete, close to 4,000 tonnes of steel, and a total of 200 km of power cables to complete PKN ORLEN’s CCGT cogeneration project in Włocławek.

{"id":8541,"text":"​PKN ORLEN is investing in the expansion of the Olefins Complex at the Płock Production Plant. It is the key project in the strategic Petrochemical Development Programme and the largest petrochemical investment project in Europe in the last 20 years. The Olefins III Complex will be built using state-of-the-art technologies to ensure, among others, greater energy efficiency, including a 30% reduction of CO2 emissions per tonne of the product. In view of the rising CO2 prices, this will directly improve the competitiveness of the Production Plant. The project is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2024 and production launch is planned for early 2025. The Olefins Complex will cover an area of almost 100 ha, or over 140 football fields. The project will add about PLN 1bn to the company’s annual EBITDA.   \n  \nThe petrochemical products manufactured in the Olefins Complex will be the basis for producing all kinds of everyday items, such as cleaning, hygiene and medical products, as well as synthetic fibres for the production of protective clothing and masks. They will also be used to produce car parts, components of household appliances and electronic devices, etc.  \n  \n“This is an important moment for PKN ORLEN and the Polish petrochemical industry. We are taking a major step towards significantly expanding the petrochemical segment at the Płock Production Plant, which – once the Olefins III Complex is completed – will be one of the most modern facilities of this type in Europe. With this project on-stream, PKN ORLEN will join the top petrochemical producers in the European market. It will also secure its competitiveness in the long run and increase its resistance to unfavourable mega-trends in the fuel market. Importantly, the project fits with the merger of Orlen and Lotos, which will supply significant volumes of kerosene to the Olefins. Petrochemicals have a huge potential. We want to harness it to deliver maximum value, in response to the steadily growing demand for high-margin petrochemical products. This will benefit the Group companies, our shareholders and the Polish economy, which will become even more competitive,\" said Daniel Obajtek, CEO and President of the PKN ORLEN Management Board.  \n  \nThe expansion of the Olefins Complex at the Płock Production Plant is part of the ORLEN2030 strategy, which assumes that PKN ORLEN will achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In furtherance of this goal, the company aims to reduce carbon emissions from its existing refinery and petrochemical assets by 20% and cut down carbon emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity by 33% by 2030.  \n  \n“For the last three years, PKN ORLEN has been in the largest investment process in its history. The process covers all areas of its operations: refining, petrochemicals, power generation, including from renewable energy sources, and the retail business. In this way PKN ORLEN strengthens its position in Europe and globally, and guarantees dynamic growth of the Polish economy and national energy security. The expansion of the Olefins Complex creates a development opportunity for the Polish chemical industry and a reliable source of supply, especially for local buyers of petrochemical products,” said Jacek Sasin, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State Assets, at the press conference.  \n  \nPKN ORLEN‘s investment project will also benefit the LOTOS Group, which will supply petroleum products for the production of petrochemicals. The city of Płock and neighbouring municipalities will also profit as new jobs will be created at the expanded Olefins Complex. The project will ultimately increase PKN ORLEN’s workforce by approximately 380 FTEs. The entire petrochemical project will generate PLN 160m in taxes for the state budget. The project will also increase the availability of base petrochemicals, which will serve as a platform for the development of Poland’s chemical industry and bring more positive effects for the entire economy.  \n  \nThe implementation of this strategic project has been greenlighted by the PKN ORLEN Supervisory Board which, in granting the consent, took into account the submission of an application for public aid to the Ministry of Development, Labour and Technology. The project’s value is estimated at PLN 13.5bn, based on a lump-sum bid for the Steam Cracker and the related units, as well as detailed estimates of expenditure on the necessary infrastructure. The plan for the project has been prepared in line with the world’s best practices.   \n  \nThe Supervisory Board’s decision opens the way to sign a contract for the expansion of the Olefins Complex III under the EPCC formula with preferred bidders, namely Hyundai Engineering and Técnicas Reunidas. In addition, special purpose vehicle ORLEN Olefiny has been established to implement the project.  \n‘We are proud that our offer has attracted significant interest from PKN ORLEN. The Olefins Complex expansion project is a great opportunity for us to increase our presence in Europe as a world-class EPC contractor,’ said Chang Hag Kim, CEO of Hyundai Engineering.  \n  \n‘We are glad to be involved in the implementation of such an important project, which will be the cornerstone for the development of PKN ORLEN’s petrochemical business. By engaging in this project we will maintain our presence in Poland and confirm our readiness to support PKN ORLEN in implementing future projects,’ said Juan Lladó, CEO of Técnicas Reunidas.  \nExpansion of the Complex will be the first project of this type carried out in Europe in recent years. Other European companies have also noticed the potential represented by base petrochemicals and announced plans to expand their olefin production capacities. However, thanks to its effective project preparation and contracting strategy, PKN ORLEN has outpaced the competition by over 12 months and it will be the first to address the shortage of base products on the market.   \n  \nThe expansion of the Olefins Complex will make it possible to leverage the economies of scale, which are vital for PKN ORLEN’s competitiveness. At present, the Company has a 5% share in the European petrochemical market. Once the project comes on stream, the share will increase to 6.4%. In this way, PKN ORLEN will consolidate its leading position in Central Europe and join the group of the largest petrochemical producers, such as Dow, Sabic, Ineos or BASF.   \n  \nCurrently, the Steam Cracker’s capacity is 640 thousand tonnes. The Olefins III project envisages increasing its actual production capacities to 1,040 thousand tonnes, that is by approximately 60%. The ORLEN Group’s total petrochemical output, currently amounting to more than 5 million tonnes, will grow by over 1 million tonnes.  \nThe implementation of the project marks a significant step towards strengthening the Płock Production Plant’s petrochemical segment. Following production launch, scheduled for early 2025, the share of crude oil used to manufacture petrochemical products in Płock will rise from 14% to 19%. This is all the more important given the declining demand for refining products and an expected increase, by as much as 80%, in demand for high-margin petrochemicals by 2050.   \n  \nAs part of the project, PKN ORLEN will consider shutting down the part of the olefin plant which was built over 40 years ago, with production capacity of about 340,000 tonnes and lower operational and energy efficiency. The more modern part, with a capacity of about 300,000 tonnes, is to be upgraded. Most importantly, however, the Group will build a new Steam Cracker with a capacity of 740,000 tonnes. The Complex will also comprise five additional production units, including a new large ethylene oxide and glycol plant. Once completed, Olefins Complex III will additionally increase PKN ORLEN’s capacity to produce other ethylene derivatives, delivering an extra margin and maximising the rate of return.\n","company_name":"Orlen Group","published_on":"2021-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","title":"PKN ORLEN starts the largest petrochemical project in Europe","emissions_rank":15,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"​PKN ORLEN is investing in the expansion of the Olefins Complex at the Płock Production Plant.

With about seven megawatts (MW), the site can supply the equivalent of up to 15,000 households with green power. The construction of the three Nordex wind turbines (type N117) started about one year ago and was finally licensed in April. The site is part of a cluster including the existing wind farms Wysoka I and II. The 25 windmills with a total capacity of about 62 MW will be operated and maintained by the same RWE team.  RWE Renewables has already gained considerable experience in Poland and will operate about a dozen onshore wind farms here with a total capacity of approximately 380 MW. The latest addition to its renewables fleet underlines RWE’s growth ambitions in this country. “Poland is an attractive market for the expansion of our business and I am happy about the tangible progress our team is making”, says Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, CEO of RWE Renewables. “We are keen to support the growth of wind energy in Poland, one of our core markets in Europe. We will promote both onshore and offshore projects in the country.”  Back in October 2019, RWE Renewables has acquired a pipeline of up to four offshore wind projects in the central Polish Baltic Sea as part of its ambitions to enter the Polish offshore market and grow its offshore operations across Europe. The four projects, which are in different development stages, are all located around the Slupsk bank area. Over the next few years, development activities will continue, and the construction phase might start as early as 2023. “The Polish market promises great untapped potential for offshore wind energy in Europe and now we have a promising pipeline with a total generation capacity of 1.8 gigawatts”, emphasizes Dotzenrath. “We are fully committed to invest in offshore wind in Poland in light of its significant benefits for the Polish economy, labour market and society.”  RWE is one of the largest players in the renewable business worldwide with a portfolio of wind and solar power assets of about 9 gigawatts.

July 2020  ”The law passed today is an important step towards implementing the coal phase-out. RWE bears the major burden with regards to the regulations on lignite. We will be decommissioning the first power plant unit already in a few months. It is therefore necessary to sign the public-law contract quickly and to complete the directive on the adjustment allowance for the employees affected in order to create legal certainty and to be able to handle the job losses in a socially acceptable manner.”  ####  Rolf Martin Schmitz, CEO of RWE AG   Today the German parliament ‘Bundestag’ passed the Coal Phase-out Act. The law also passed the German Upper House ‘Bundesrat’ today. The regulations in the law to end the use of lignite by 2038 at the latest mean severe cuts for the company. However, they create the necessary planning security for the company and its employees. Before the end of this year, RWE will shut down the first power plant unit with a capacity of 300 megawatts. Further power plant units with a total capacity of 2,500 MW will follow in the next two years. Until 2030, RWE will shut down two thirds of its lignite-fired capacity and thus bears the major burden of the measures laid down in the decommissioning path for lignite.  The closures also have significant consequences for lignite production. The Inden and Hambach opencast mines will be closed earlier than planned, and the Hambach forest will be retained. Over 1.1 billion tonnes of lignite reserves - more than half of the volumes approved for mining - will remain in the ground. Soon, only the Garzweiler opencast mine will be available to safely supply the remaining power plants and refineries with lignite. The Coal Phase-out Act therefore notes that the Garzweiler opencast mine is necessary for the energy industry in order to ensure security of energy supply against the backdrop of the 2016 guiding decision (‘Leitentscheidung’) of the state of North-Rhine Westphalia. This also includes the well advanced 3rd resettlement phase. The coal under the affected villages will be needed as early as 2024.  RWE has already submitted an adapted area concept (‘Revierkonzept’) to the North Rhine-Westphalian state government to contribute to the preparation of a new guiding decision (‘Leitentscheidung’) for the Rhenish lignite mining area. The company will pay special attention to the social aspects of the people affected. The cushioning of social hardships had also been recommended by the Commission for Growth, Structural Change and Employment (‘KWSB’), representing a broad spectrum of society.   For the considerable burdens that RWE will have to bear as a result of the coal phase-out, the company will receive compensation amounting to €2.6 billion, which will be paid out over the next 15 years. This amount is significantly lower than the actual loss RWE will suffer, which is around €3.5 billion.   As a result of the regulations, more than 3,000 jobs in the lignite-based business will be lost at RWE by the end of 2022; by 2030 the total number of jobs lost will be about 6,000. This will reduce the total number of people employed in the lignite system by over 60% in just 10 years. In this context, it is necessary that the regulations on the adjustment allowance (‘Anpassungsgeld’) and on compensation for any pension disadvantages arising in the statutory pension insurance system be established quickly. The trade unions had vehemently advocated this. In addition, the company will also contribute to the job losses being handled in a socially acceptable manner.   The Coal Phase-out Act also provides a clear framework for hard coal fired power stations. RWE will wait for the concrete tender design to be published and will then investigate options.   Rolf Martin Schmitz underlines: \"The long process was a tremendous emotional burden for RWE employees. Even under those difficult circumstances, they continued to contribute to a secure electricity supply. Now is the time for all social groups represented in the Commission for Growth, Structural Change and Employment to support the responsible implementation of the coal phase-out.\"  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Coal phase-out regulated by law after two years","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2020-07-03-coal-phase-out-regulated-by-law-after-two-years","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-ag\/2020\/2020-07-03-coal-phase-out-regulated-by-law-after-two-years.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

{"id":8655,"text":"RWE’s innovative electrolysis project Eemshydrogen enters next phase    * RWE intend to supply OCI N.V.'s production facility BioMCN and Evonik with green hydrogen    ### Essen, 6 November 2020  “Green hydrogen offers huge potential for the energy transition and for RWE, as well. We have the know-how and the renewables plants to produce green hydrogen ourselves. And thanks to our energy trading unit, we can operate electrolysers optimally in line with market’s requirements. Hydrogen plays an important role for the decarbonisation of the industry sector, as not all industrial production processes are suitable for electrification. It is important to get the hydrogen economy moving quickly for the Netherlands and Europe to keep the competitive advantage in the global market place. RWE are determined to play an active part in creating a hydrogen economy.”   ####  Roger Miesen, CEO RWE Generation   RWE is developing Eemshydrogen, an innovative project for green hydrogen production at Eemshaven, to demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated hydrogen value chain with vast scaling potential. To contribute to the economic viability of the project, RWE has now signed a letter of intent with OCI N.V.'s production facility BioMCN on the supply of green hydrogen in the future. In addition, RWE intends to provide green hydrogen to Evonik. Both companies in Delfzijl plan to use the green hydrogen in their business processes for making sustainable products. The amount of green hydrogen that RWE will supply to both companies is under evaluation. The conclusion of the agreements is a next step for RWE in the development and realisation of a 50 megawatts electrolyser, directly connected to RWE’s Westereems onshore wind farm in Eemshaven with an installed capacity of 162 MW.  Eemshydrogen is part of the necessary development of scaling up and cost reduction in the production of green hydrogen. The project contributes to the broad investment agenda of the Northern Netherlands for hydrogen, including users in various sectors, infrastructure and large-scale storage. BioMCN, for example, plans to use green hydrogen to produce green methanol, which can be used as a green raw material for chemistry or as an alternative renewable fuel in transport.  About Eemshydrogen  To explore innovations in the hydrogen area RWE started a feasibility study in 2019 aimed at producing green hydrogen in Eemshaven. The resulting Eemshydrogen project is comprised of, in the first phase, the development and realisation of a 50 MW electrolyser in Eemshaven with a direct connection to RWE's Westereems onshore wind farm. Depending on market developments and regulations, the electrolysis capacity can be further scaled up. The green hydrogen produced by the installation can yield more than 250,000 tons of CO2 savings over the project’s lifetime. RWE alongside developers of electrolysers, are evaluating technical options for producing hydrogen in a flexible way, linked to intermittent wind power generation. A final investment decision for the project is expected to be taken in 2021, production of green hydrogen could start in 2024. Furthermore, the Eemshydrogen project contributes to the development of a hydrogen infrastructure in Northern Netherlands by enabling the conversion of electric power into hydrogen. The produced hydrogen can be stored, transported and made available to industrial customers. In addition, the production of hydrogen can contribute to limiting congestion in the electricity network.  RWE active player on hydrogen  In addition to Eemshydrogen, RWE in Germany is working on, among other things, the GET H2 project. This aims to build up the entire hydrogen value chain. In addition, RWE has become a member of the AquaVentus project off the coast of Heligoland in the German North Sea, a concept for the production of hydrogen using offshore wind, with the island as a central hub. RWE’s offshore wind farms on site – Nordsee Ost, Amrumbank West and in the future Kaskasi– are ideal for this. In other countries where RWE is active, options are also being explored. In the United Kingdom, for example, RWE is looking at how hydrogen infrastructures can be used together with partners in the large industrial clusters.  ### Downloads    * Press release   * Infographic","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE’s innovative electrolysis project Eemshydrogen enters next phase","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Generation SE","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-generation\/2020-11-06-rwes-innovative-electrolysis-project-eemshydrogen-enters-next-phase","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-generation-se\/2020\/2020-11-06-rwes-innovative-electrolysis-project-eemshydrogen-enters-next-phase.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The addition of this facility to our operating portfolio is just one example of RWE’s strong focus on the U.S. market and its growing ambition in solar and battery storage. The co-location of a solar plant along with storage provides us flexibility in finding solutions to fulfill the energy requirements of our customers.”   ####  Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, CEO of RWE Renewables   RWE Renewables’ Hickory Park Solar project, a 195.5-megawatt (MWac) facility coupled with a 40 megawatt 2-hour battery storage system, located in Mitchell County, Georgia, is under construction. RWE is the operator and manager of the solar facility, selling the energy and renewable attributes from the facility to Georgia Power through its Renewable Energy Development Initiative program. The project is expected to be online in late 2021.  The company announced in November 2019 it entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Georgia Power Company, an investor owned public utility that serves more than 2.6 million customers.  “We are extremely pleased to have a project of this size in Georgia under construction,” said Silvia Ortin, COO Onshore Wind and Solar PV Americas. “We look forward to working with Georgia Power, a company that’s committed to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to advance solar in Georgia.”  When complete, the Hickory Park solar power plant will interconnect more than 650,000 solar panels, which together will cover an area of about 1,800 acres. The integration of a state-of-the-art DC-coupled storage system will allow the project’s energy yield to be optimized and increase the predictability of injection of locally produced energy into the Georgia Power grid. This demonstrates how RWE is able to propose storage solutions that fit its customers’ needs to integrate more clean energy into the grid.  RWE Renewables aspires to play a major role in energy storage across its target markets, where more than 50 percent of the total global utility scale storage additions are expected. In the US, we are developing a number of storage projects either standalone or co-located with our Solar projects.  The U.S. accounts for more than one third of the RWE Group´s renewables capacity playing a key role in RWE’s strategy to grow its renewables business and to become carbon neutral by 2040. RWE constructs, owns and operates some of the highest performing wind, solar and energy storage projects in the U.S.  In addition to Hickory Park, RWE owns and operates West of the Pecos solar project, a 100 MW (ac) project located in Reeves County, Texas. Furthermore, RWE has significant experience in the U.S. onshore market with more than 4.2 GW (RWE’s pro rata share is about 3.6 GW) of onshore wind. In addition, RWE has at the moment almost 1 GW of onshore wind farms under construction in the U.S. The projects are located in Texas, Oklahoma, Ohio and New York State.  As an established leader in renewables, RWE has recently entered into a joint venture, New England Alpha Ventus, focused on floating offshore wind in the state of Maine.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE’s Hickory Park solar project with co-located storage facility under construction","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2020-11-17-rwes-hickory-park-solar-project-with-co-located-storage-facility-under-construction","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-renewables\/2020\/2020-11-17-rwes-hickory-park-solar-project-with-co-located-storage-facility-under-construction.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":8660,"text":"FUREC project to use waste stream for hydrogen production    * Circular economy at Chemelot Limburg    ### Essen, 19 November 2020  „At RWE, we are working with partners from industry and the scientific community to drive forward more than 30 hydrogen projects in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. RWE is one of the few companies to be involved in projects along the entire hydrogen value chain. For the chemical industry, hydrogen offers great potential for decarbonising the production processes and making them more sustainable. Our FUREC project represents an important step forward as we create a circular hub in the Limburg region and help our industrial partners to lower their carbon footprint.”   ####  Roger Miesen, CEO of RWE Generation   RWE Generation is developing a project to produce hydrogen by using waste stream at industrial park Chemelot in the province of Limburg in the Netherlands. The FUREC project - Fuse Reuse Recycle - will produce hydrogen for the chemical industry and help to make their production processes more sustainable. Waste streams, such as Limburg's residual waste, serve as a substitute for natural gas in the production of hydrogen. The project contributes to the ambition of the local business community, educational facilities and the province to develop Limburg into a circular hub. Furthermore, it aims at setting up a hydrogen link between the Dutch seaports and the German Ruhr area.  The FUREC project plans to transform residual waste into raw material pellets, which are then converted into hydrogen at industrial park Chemelot. This process will reduce the use of natural gas at Chemelot by more than 200 million m3 per year. This is comparable to the annual gas demand of approximately 140,000 households and results in a CO2 reduction of 380,000 tonnes per year. The CO2 released during the production of hydrogen can be either captured and stored or used as a raw material in the future. In addition to local sales at Chemelot, the hydrogen can eventually be transported to industry in Rotterdam and the German Ruhr area.  Ruud Burlet, Provincial Executive of Limburg (Circular Economy, Sustainability, Environment): „This innovative hydrogen project from RWE and Chemelot contributes significantly to our ambition: making Limburg a role model when it comes to the transition to a sustainable future. With the Chemelot Circular Hub, we want to become the first real circular hub in Europe, where sustainable materials and products that people and society are waiting for are developed with the help of green chemistry. There is no such thing as unusable waste. With this revamped chemical industry, we are turning the sustainability transition into a new economic engine for the region.”  Loek Radix, CEO of Chemelot: „Just like Chemelot, RWE attaches great importance to circularity and innovation. The fact that RWE has chosen to produce circular hydrogen at Chemelot makes me enormously proud and is a great compliment to the way in which Chemelot is positioned. This new collaboration fits in perfectly with Chemelot's and the region's ambition to become the first circular hub in Europe.”  Next steps  In the coming period, RWE will further develop the project and start the necessary licensing procedures. The company aims to make a final investment decision in 2022. Discussions on the further details of the project are currently underway. RWE is also looking at Sustainable Multifunctional Business Park Zevenellen (gemeente Leudal) as possible location for converting the waste streams in a closed system into raw materials pellets. RWE is discussing the possible future sale of hydrogen with OCI N.V., which has a production plant at Chemelot. Hydrogen would enable the company to make its production chain more sustainable and contribute to circular food production. The FUREC project is a new and important step in the development and acceleration of the transition to a circular economy in the province and the creation of a sustainable value chain.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"FUREC project to use waste stream for hydrogen production","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Generation SE","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-generation\/2020-11-19-furec-project-to-use-waste-stream-for-hydrogen-production","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-generation-se\/2020\/2020-11-19-furec-project-to-use-waste-stream-for-hydrogen-production.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":8665,"text":"Compensation allocated at hard coal phase-out auction: RWE closes power stations in Hamm and Ibbenbüren    * Affected employees are supported in a socially responsible manner   * RWE underlines its CO2 reduction strategy    ### Essen, 1 December 2020  During the first German auction to decommission hard coal-fired power plants, RWE Generation has been allocated compensation for both the 800 megawatts Unit E of its Westfalen power plant in Hamm and its 800 megawatts Unit B of the Ibbenbüren power plant. This has been announced by the German Federal Network Agency today. As a consequence, RWE will no longer be entitled to market the electricity generated in these plants after December 31 of this year. Subject to the review by the transmission system operators, the last two hard coal-fired power plants of RWE in Germany will be decommissioned. For both plants, with a total net capacity of 1,560 megawatts, the company will receive 216 million euros in line with the awards of the auction.  “This will be a very bitter blow for those employees whose power plant will be shut down at such short notice”, emphasised Roger Miesen, CEO of RWE Generation. “The collective agreement, which was concluded at the end of August, ensures that there will be no forced redundancies and that the shutdown will be carried out in a socially responsible manner”, said Miesen. RWE employs 166 people at the Westfalen power station and 88 at the Ibbenbüren power plant. RWE will now prepare the decommissioning process and the associated personnel measures together with the company's co-determination councils.  With regard to the auction’s result, Miesen said: “We submitted bids for both Westfalen and Ibbenbüren which represent an adequate compensation for the loss of the future value of our power plants. This underlines our CO2 reduction strategy. RWE will be carbon-neutral by 2040. The closure of the plants in Ibbenbüren and Hamm is a further step in this direction.”  Plans for the subsequent use of both sites will be further developed in due course and in consultation with regional stakeholders.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Compensation allocated at hard coal phase-out auction: RWE closes power stations in Hamm and Ibbenbüren","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Generation SE","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-generation\/2020-12-01-compensation-allocated-at-hard-coal-phase-out-auction-rwe-closes-power-stations-in-hamm-and-ibbenbueren","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-generation-se\/2020\/2020-12-01-compensation-allocated-hard-coal-phase-out-auction-rwe-closes-power-stations.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

We will do all we can to support the path to decommissioning in accordance with the law, and at the same time do our part to help achieve the energy transition. Decommissioning this unit is also a further step forward in implementing our rigorous CO2 reduction strategy. By 2040, RWE will be carbon neutral and will end electricity production based on lignite by 2038.”   ####  Dr Frank Weigand, CEO RWE Power   From 31 December 2020, RWE Power will decommission the 300-megawatt Unit D at its Niederaussem lignite power station. Decommissioning this unit forms part of the process of exiting from coal, initiated by Germany’s Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment in 2019 and codified by both houses of the German parliament this summer in the Coal-fired Power Generation Termination Act (Kohleverstromungsbeendigungsgesetz).   Decommissioning Unit D will mean a loss of about 300 jobs in the overall lignite process chain from sourcing the raw material in opencast mines to operating and maintaining the power station. By the end of 2022, by which time RWE will have taken 2.8 gigawatts of power station capacity out of the system, this figure will rise to about 3,000 jobs. By 2030, as much as two-thirds of RWE’s lignite-based power station capacity will have been decommissioned, affecting 6,000 jobs in total. The collective agreement concluded at the end of August will ensure there are no redundancies, and that the decommissioning process will be socially cushioned.   During the first few years of the process, RWE will bear the brunt of the exit from lignite in Germany. In addition, RWE will terminate hard-coal generation in Germany on 31 December after winning the tender at the first nationwide decommissioning auction for hard-coal power plants for the 800-megawatt Unit E at Kraftwerk Westfalen power station in Hamm and the 800-megawatt Unit B at Kraftwerk Ibbenbüren power station. At the same time, the company is continuing to push ahead with the expansion of renewable energies.   “The fact Unit D has operated reliably in generating electricity for so many years is down to professional management and a well thought-out and successful maintenance programme – and thus also the commitment by the entire team,” emphasises RWE Power management board member Dr Lars Kulik.   Since it was first put into service on 1 May 1968, Unit D has operated for 390,000 hours and generated more than 115 billion kilowatt hours of electricity using 129 million tonnes of lignite. In purely arithmetic terms, that would be enough to supply all electricity consumers in Düsseldorf for almost 30 years. Decommissioning the unit will result in a reduction in carbon emissions of about 2.5 million tonnes per year.  Effective October 2019, five other 300 MW units belonging to RWE have been out of full-time operation but have each been retained on standby for a four-year period. Depending on when the standby arrangement began in each case, these will be definitively decommissioned in October 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively.   ### Downloads    * Press release   * Press picture","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2020-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Coal Phase-out Act: RWE Power takes first plant off grid","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Power AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-power\/2020-12-30-coal-phase-out-act-rwe-power-takes-first-plant-off-grid","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-power-ag\/2020\/2020-12-30-coal-exit-rwe-power-takes-first-plant-off-grid.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The future “Bedburg A 44n” wind farm will be situated on a recultivated former opencast mining site near the new motorway section of the same name. There, five Nordex wind turbines with an installed capacity of 5.7 megawatts each and a hub height of 164 metres will be erected over the coming months. They are due to be commissioned early in 2022.  Just like nearby Königshovener Höhe wind farm (67.2 MW), the Bedburg A 44n project is a joint venture of RWE Renewables (51%) with the City of Bedburg (49%).  Four of the wind turbines will feed electricity into the grid using the existing RWE Power infrastructure at the Garzweiler opencast mine.  The fifth wind turbine will provide electricity into the grid via the Bedburg-Kaster resource conservation village, which is currently under construction. This is a housing project of 130 units with an innovative energy, architecture and urban development concept. The project is another joint venture between the City of Bedburg and RWE, with additional partners, including E.ON, Westnetz and the Faktor-X agency; it is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy programme “Regulatory Sandboxes for the Energy Transition”.   The planners’ vision is to use part of the electricity produced by the fifth turbine at Bedburg 44n wind farm to supply the resource conservation village with the help of an energy storage system, with the remainder feeding into the grid system.   Katja Wünschel, COO Wind Onshore & Solar PV Europe & APAC of RWE Renewables: “RWE is building yet another wind farm on a former opencast mining site. This is already the sixth one in the Rhenish mining district, where we will soon reach an installed wind power capacity of 200 megawatts. With this latest investment we are also taking another step towards implementing our ambitious strategy for reducing carbon emissions. By 2040, RWE as a whole will be carbon neutral.”  Sascha Solbach, Mayor of Bedburg: “The Rhenish mining district is in an excellent position to remain an energy-producing region – with conventional energy sources being phased out and renewables being expanded in the area. Energy transition and structural change will be more successful if we skillfully connect the different sectors to each other. In this region, our windfarm is the central link. And once we can link up the new wind farm and our resource conservation village, we will be leading the way in energy storage, distribution and utilisation here in Bedburg.”  RWE is expanding its onshore portfolio  RWE already operates onshore wind parks with a total installed capacity of approximately 650 MW in Germany. Currently, the company is constructing the Jüchen A44n cooperative wind farm (27 MW) in collaboration with NEW Re and the City of Jüchen. Six wind turbines are being erected on recultivated land, which was previously part of the Garzweiler opencast mine. Commissioning is planned for spring. RWE is also continuously expanding its international wind portfolio of more than 6 gigawatts (GW). In addition to the domestic market in Germany, the company is currently constructing onshore wind farms in the US, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Italy and the UK.

Scioto Ridge is RWE’s 28th onshore wind farm in the U.S. and has the capacity to provide clean energy for more than 60,000 households.  Ohio has enormous potential for future projects, as wind power provides less than 2 percent of the total electricity generation in the state. In addition Ohio has a long history of industrial manufacturing, including approximately 52 wind-related factories – the most of any single state in the U.S.  The U.S. accounts for more than one third of the RWE Group’s renewables capacity playing a key role in RWE’s strategy to grow its renewables business. RWE constructs, owns and operates some of the highest performing wind, solar and energy storage projects in the U.S.  Furthermore, RWE has entered into a joint venture, New England Aqua Ventus, focused on floating offshore wind in the state of Maine.

{"id":8743,"text":"The end of an era: RWE hard-coal power stations in Hamm and Ibbenbüren to be completely decommissioned  RWE hard-coal power station in Ibbenbüren     * RWE’s exit from hard-coal in Germany will then be finished   * Decommissioning underlines CO2 reduction strategy \/ RWE’s goal: climate-neutrality by 2040     ### Essen, 8 July 2021  “For our company, today marks the end of the era of hard-coal generation in Germany. This is another important step for RWE towards climate-neutrality by 2040. We are rigorously pursuing this goal while also taking responsibility for our colleagues at both locations. Respect and thanks go to them. Shift by shift, they have worked hard as a team for a reliable supply of electricity in Germany.”   ####  Roger Miesen, CEO of RWE Generation   During the night from 7 to 8 July, the preparedness phase for RWE’s last two hard-coal-fired power stations in Germany came to an end. At the Westfalen in Hamm and Ibbenbüren locations, the last units will be decommissioned. For RWE, this signals the end of the era of hard-coal power generation in Germany.   In December 2020, in the first nationwide decommissioning auction for hard-coal power stations, RWE Generation had received the tenders both for the 800-megawatt Block E at the Westfalen power station as well as for the 800-megawatt Block B at Ibbenbüren power station. As a result, since the beginning of this year, RWE has no longer been allowed to sell electricity from these stations. As part of a mandatory six-month preparedness phase, the Westfalen station went online 13 times for reasons of security of supply on the request of the transmission system operator. Now this phase has also ended and from 8 July no more coal may be fired at either of these two locations. The decommissioning of the hard-coal units is a further important step towards climate-neutrality, which RWE will achieve by 2040.  “In our plans, it was always particularly important to handle the staff reductions in a socially responsible manner. We want to ensure that the affected colleagues move from gainful employment into gainful employment and will see to it that no one is left behind”, said Hartmut Frank, Head of the Westfalen and Ibbenbüren power stations.  Leonhard Zubrowski, works council chair at RWE Generation, emphasised: “Even though the decision has been public since December, these are difficult days again for the workforce at the two locations. It is all the more important, therefore, that all staff are offered prospects as soon as possible. In this context, the fact that we completed the regulations for socially responsible staff reductions at an early stage is paying off. In this way, those affected can be provided with clarity about their future as quickly as possible. I would like to thank all my colleagues for their great dedication. With their knowledge and years of experience, they have ensured that the plants were always ready to go when they were needed and thus contributed to the secure supply of electricity.\" Since they were commissioned, the two units have produced a total of 158 billion kilowatt hours of electricity – enough to supply the equivalent of 35 million private households with electrical energy for one whole year.  The Westfalen site will continue to make an important contribution towards the energy transition, since the Federal Network Agency has categorised it as systemically relevant. The generator of Block E is to be repurposed as a rotating phase shifter and will provide reactive power for voltage stability – an important service for stabilising the electricity grid. This has no effect on RWE's carbon footprint, as no coal is burned to operate a phase shifter. Unit B of the Ibbenbüren power plant was not classified as systemically relevant by the Federal Network Agency, so the decommissioning of the power plant is now beginning.   RWE is consistently phasing out coal: In the UK and Germany, there are no longer any hard coal-fired power plants in operation, and in the Netherlands the conversion of two plants to biomass is progressing. In the Rhenish lignite mining region, RWE already shut down the first unit at the end of 2020 – as stipulated in the coal phase-out law. Further units will follow in the next 18 months, so that by the end of 2022 a power plant capacity of 2.8 gigawatts will have been shut down. By 2030, a total of two-thirds of RWE's lignite-fired power plant capacity will have been taken off the grid. This is associated with the reduction of about 6,000 jobs, which will be carried out in a socially responsible manner. At the same time, the company is rigorously pushing ahead with the expansion of renewable energies. Today, RWE is already one of the world's largest producers of green electricity.

{"id":8755,"text":"RWE forges ahead with growth in renewables business and presents good half-year results    * Gross capital expenditure in renewable energies in first half of 2021 doubles year on year, totalling €1.8 billion       * Portfolio of wind farms and solar plants as well as storage systems to grow to more than 13 gigawatts by end of 2022; 3.9 gigawatts currently under construction with commissioning planned by end of 2022      * Outlook for fiscal 2021 raised significantly on account of exceptionally strong performance by Supply & Trading      * Adjusted EBITDA at previous year’s level of around €1.8 billion despite weather effects – adjusted net income up year on year at €870 million     ### Essen, 12 August 2021  “The transformation of RWE is progressing swiftly. In the first half of the year we invested €1.8 billion gross in renewables, which was twice as much as in the first six months of 2020. And we are continuing full speed ahead. This year we will commission new wind farms and solar plants as well as storage systems with 1.8 gigawatts, with a further 2.1 gigawatts to follow next year. This will take us to our target of more than 13 gigawatts by the end of 2022. Financially, we are also doing well. We have therefore significantly raised our 2021 earnings forecast. ”   ####  Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE AG   The transformation of RWE is continuing at a fast pace. During the first six months of 2021, the company invested €1.8 billion gross in new wind farms and solar plants as well as battery projects. That’s twice as much as in the same period last year. RWE currently has projects amounting to 3.9 gigawatts (GW) under construction, which will be commissioned by the end of 2022. Thus, the portfolio will grow from 9.3 GW today to more than 13 GW by the end of 2022. In addition, RWE has started construction on the 1.4-GW offshore wind farm Sofia off the British coast, which is scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of 2026.  Financially, the first half of 2021 was also very good. On the back of an exceptionally high earnings contribution by Supply & Trading, RWE has significantly increased its outlook for fiscal 2021.  Leading in the development of new solutions  RWE is forging ahead with state-of-the-art technologies like floating offshore, floating solar and storage. As one of the key players in setting up the hydrogen economy, RWE is working with partners on more than 30 projects along the value chain.  Another important element in the transformation of RWE is the rigorous phaseout of coal. The company’s last two hard coal-fired power stations in Germany have been decommissioned. For lignite, the first wave of decommissioning is in progress: At the end of the year, three more units in the Rhenish region will be taken off the grid. As a consequence of the phaseout of coal, RWE will have to cut over 3,000 jobs by the end of 2022 alone. This will be done in a socially responsible way and in close consultation with the social partners.  Extraordinarily strong result in Supply & Trading offsets weather effects  Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) of RWE Group in the first half of 2021 was on the previous year’s level, at €1,751 million (1st half of 2020: €1,833 million). The same applies to adjusted EBIT, at €1,042 million (1st half of 2020: €1,113 million). Adjusted net income was up year-on-year, at €870 million (1st half of 2020: €816 million).  For fiscal 2021, RWE now expects to achieve adjusted EBITDA of between €3.0 billion and €3.4 billion at Group level, which is €350 million higher than forecast in March 2021. In the core business, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between €2.15 billion and €2.55 billion. The range for adjusted EBIT was raised to €1.5 billion to €1.9 billion. RWE now expects its adjusted net income to be between €1.05 billion and €1.4 billion, an increase of €300 million. The dividend statement is confirmed: For the current financial year, the company still aims to increase the dividend to €0.90 per share.  In its core business with the Offshore Wind, Onshore Wind\/Solar, Hydro\/Biomass\/Gas and Supply & Trading segments, RWE achieved adjusted EBITDA of €1,206 million in the first six months of 2021. The figure for the same period last year was €1,523 million.  Offshore Wind: Adjusted EBITDA in the Offshore Wind segment was €459 million for the first half of the year, compared to €585 million for the same period in the previous year. This was because wind volumes were much lower in Northern and Central Europe than the very high level witnessed a year before. For the current year, RWE expects adjusted EBITDA of between €1,050 million and €1,250 million for this segment.  Onshore Wind\/Solar: In the first six months of 2021, the Onshore Wind\/Solar segment recorded adjusted EBITDA of minus €42 million, compared to €299 million in the same period in 2020. The extreme cold snap in Texas led to an earnings shortfall of around €400 million. Additional burdens resulted from below-average wind conditions at onshore wind farm locations in Northern and Central Europe.  Book gains from the sale of RWE’s shares in three US onshore wind farms and earnings contributions from new plants had a positive effect. For the current year, RWE expects adjusted EBITDA of between €50 million and €250 million for this segment.  Hydro\/Biomass\/Gas: With adjusted EBITDA of €297 million, business in the Hydro\/Biomass\/Gas segment was below the previous year’s level of €324 million. The wood pellet production business in the US, which was sold in mid-2020, stopped contributing to earnings. In addition, earnings from electricity produced using biomass in the Netherlands fluctuate during the year. However, RWE expects to achieve higher income from biomass usage for the year as a whole. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment should lie in a range between €500 million and €600 million.  Supply & Trading: The Supply & Trading business once again recorded an outstanding performance. Adjusted EBITDA reached €525 million, exceeding the already high level of €322 million achieved last year. For this segment, therefore, RWE has raised its outlook and now expects adjusted EBITDA to be significantly above €350 million for 2021 as a whole.  Non-core business result in line with expectations  Adjusted EBITDA in the Coal\/Nuclear segment was €545 million, compared to €310 million for the same period in the previous year. For electricity from lignite and nuclear power, RWE realised higher wholesale margins than in 2020. For the year as a whole, it continues to expect adjusted EBITDA of between €800 million and €900 million for this segment.  Comfortable financial situation  The Group’s net debt decreased to €903 million (31 December 2020: €4,432 million). This was due mainly to a very good adjusted operating cash flow and timing effects from hedging activities as well as a decline in pension provisions resulting from higher discount rates.  Michael Müller, CFO of RWE AG, comments: “We posted a better business performance than we expected at the start of the year, which is very gratifying. Our financial situation remains good, and it enables us to maintain our high pace of investment. We will present our plans for beyond 2022 at our Capital Market Day on 15 November 2021.”  ### Downloads    * Press release   * All informationen about the press conference call   * Press conference call speech of Markus Krebber and Michael Müller","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE forges ahead with growth in renewables business and presents good half-year results","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2021-08-12-rwe-forges-ahead-with-growth-in-renewables-business-and-presents-good-half-year-results","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-ag\/2021\/2021-08-12-rwe-forges-ahead-with-growth-in-renewables-business-and-presents-good-half-year-results.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

As one of the leading onshore wind companies our strategy for renewables is geared for growth. We look forward to providing clean energy and long-term benefits to the local community for years to come.”   ####  Silvia Ortín, CEO Wind Onshore and PV, RWE Renewables   RWE Renewables has started commercial operation on its 125 megawatt (MW) onshore Cassadaga Wind Farm. The project, located in Chautauqua County, is powered by 27 Nordex and 10 Siemens Gamesa turbines and has the capacity to provide clean energy for more than 37,000 households. Cassadaga is RWE’s 29th onshore wind farm in the U.S. and represents RWE’s second onshore wind project in New York.  RWE’s first wind farm in New York, Munnsville Wind Farm, a 34.5 MW project located Madison County, came online in 2007.   “We’re proud to be a leader in development in New York state, as Cassadaga marks the first project completed under the state’s Article 10 law,” said Silvia Ortin, CEO Wind Onshore and PV. “We thank the state and local officials for their outstanding support allowing us to bring significant investment to Chautauqua county.”  New York State’s Article 10 law provides comprehensive guidance to the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment about authorizing construction and operation of major electric generating facilities. The Article 10 law defines the application process for developers, while providing a rigorous process for local input and ensuring environmental and public health laws are followed.  The U.S. accounts for more than one third of the RWE Group’s renewables capacity playing a key role in RWE’s strategy to grow its renewables business and get to net zero by 2040. RWE constructs, owns and operates some of the highest performing wind, solar and energy storage projects in the U.S.  As an established leader in renewables, RWE has entered into a joint venture, New England Aqua Ventus, focused on floating offshore wind in the state of Maine.

RWE is one of the leading companies in renewable energies and is fully committed to supporting the Race to Zero Campaign. We see the UK as an attractive location for ongoing investments, which presents a stable regulatory framework and has great natural wind resources. In line with this, RWE is already the UK’s second largest generator and is investing some £5billion in two of our flagship offshore wind projects. With an ambitious pipeline of growth opportunities across our fleet which includes the UK’s largest offshore development pipeline, we have the potential to increase that overall investment of around £15billion by 2030.”   ####  Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE AG   RWE strives to play a key role in helping achieve net zero ambitions in the UK, one of its most strategically important markets, as business leaders join the Global Investment Summit in London today. RWE AG CEO Markus Krebber is taking part in the government-led summit, which brings together leaders of the UK’s most significant investors in order to encourage further investment into UK green growth initiatives.  RWE is a leader in renewable energies in the UK, having pioneered both onshore and offshore wind over more than 20 years. It is also one of the largest providers of firm flexible generation, which is crucial for security of supply. The company already operates 3.7gigawatts (GW) of wind capacity (RWE share 2.1GW) and around 7GW of modern and efficient gas-fired capacity in the UK.   Much of RWE’s current investment is focused on offshore wind. With partners, RWE is investing around £5 billion into two UK offshore wind farms alone - Triton Knoll and Sofia Offshore Wind Farm. Both projects expect to channel 50% and 60% respectively of their total investments into UK suppliers. Over the next decade, RWE is also looking to accelerate its deployment of wind power across the UK. It is currently developing four new offshore wind farms, which represent a combined potential installed capacity of around 2.6 GW (RWE’s pro rata share 1.3 GW), and is preferred bidder for two new adjacent offshore sites on Dogger Bank (potential installed capacity of 3 GW).  RWE is also developing a portfolio of new onshore wind whilst pursuing floating wind ambitions in Scotland and in the Celtic Sea, off the coast of South West Wales. Finally, the company is developing new battery storage solutions and exploring the broader decarbonisation of its Pembroke Power Station through new hydrogen initiatives, and options for CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) within its gas fleet.  Overall, and including its committed investments in projects already under construction, RWE expects to invest around £15billion in new green technologies and infrastructure in the UK by 2030.  RWE is investing in total more than 90 percent of its capital in sustainable technologies as e.g. renewables energies or batteries. It is targeting investments worldwide of €5 billion net from 2020 until 2022 in order to grow its net capacity of wind and solar to more than 13 gigawatts by the end of 2022.  Across its entire portfolio, RWE’s green growth investments represent a significant boost to the local, regional and national supply chain, and to the local communities with whom the company is committed to working alongside. Through its investments in new renewable energies, hydrogen and storage technologies, RWE represents a major opportunity for UK clean energy and supply chain growth. The company is also supporting the development of high skilled, well-paid jobs, especially in priority coastal communities, training in skills and apprenticeships, and is encouraging employees new to the renewables sector and those transitioning across from other industries such as oil and gas.  Markus Krebber underlined: “RWE has expertise in supplying clean energy and has over 2,600 dedicated people working in our teams across the UK, in renewables, our gas-fired plants, and our commercial supply and trading teams. Our teams are fully committed to RWE’s goals of sustainability and becoming net zero by 2040. Through our experience of investing in pioneering energies around the world, and providing stable and secure energy supply, we have the scale and experience to be a key partner in helping power the nation and we are here for the long haul.”  Pictures of Markus Krebber for media use (credit: RWE) are available at the RWE Media Centre  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE targets £multi-billion investments by 2030 to deliver UK net zero ambitions","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2021-10-19-rwe-targets-multi-billion-investments-to-deliver-uk-net-zero-ambitions","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-renewables\/2021\/2021-10-19-rwe-targets-multi-billion-investments-to-deliver-uk-net-zero-ambitions.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":8778,"text":"World’s first: RWE builds wind turbines on a sea dike dam in the Netherlands    * Oostpolderdijk Wind Farm in Eemshaven demonstrates future opportunities for sea dikes   * Special climbing crane helps to construct wind turbines due to limited space         ### Essen, 20. October 2021  “We are proud to be building Oostpolderdijk Wind Farm as the first of its kind worldwide with wind turbines on a sea dike dam. We are committed to bringing innovations forward like this, in order to further broaden and expand the opportunities in the field of sustainable electricity production. By combining knowledge, innovation and determination, we have added a new function to a sea dike dam in the Netherlands. The experience we gain from this project will be market leading, and will potentially open up further opportunities to build wind farms on dikes in other locations too. And of course: Safety and the integrity of the dike are our top priority.”   ####  Katja Wünschel, COO Wind Onshore & Solar PV Europe & APAC RWE Renewables   World premiere in Eemshaven: RWE builds the first wind turbines on a sea dike dam.    The Oostpolderdijk Wind Farm in the Dutch province of Groningen will consist of three turbines. This is the first time that such a project has been undertaken. Due to limited space at the site of the dike a climbing crane is being used to install the top turbine components. So far, the foundations and the lowest turbine components of the wind turbines have already been built. One wind turbine has been fully completed, and the climbing crane has begun the further construction of the second wind turbine.  In recent years, RWE and Water Board Noorderzijlvest (the owner of the sea dike dam) have conducted meticulous research into the construction process and dike safety, as well as the impact of the project on the local environment. This has resulted in a highly specialized technical design which is now being implemented. The most important aspect of the design has been to guarantee the safety of the dike and its dam function. Wind Farm Oostpolderdijk, with a total installed capacity of 7.5 MW, is expected to be operational by the end of 2021.  In February, RWE concluded a power purchase agreement (PPA) with ASML, the world’s largest supplier of lithography systems for the semi-conductor industry, for the purchase of green power generated by Oostpolderdijk Wind Farm and other projects.   Sustainable production portfolio in the Netherlands   RWE is a globally leading player in the energy transition sector. The Netherlands is one of the strategic markets where the company wants to further expand its sustainable energy portfolio. RWE is currently operating seven onshore wind farms with a capacity of 268 MW (pro rata view) and two solar parks, in addition to its other business activities (gas, hard coal\/biomass). Including Oostpolderdijk Wind Farm RWE is now constructing four new onshore wind farms in the Netherlands with a total capacity of 116 MW. Furthermore, RWE will add the first floating solar project to its sustainable portfolio, as well as a ground-mounted solar project. Both projects are part of Solar park Amer. In addition to this RWE is also working on the expansion of CO2-free flexible production capacity, as well as on the development of hydrogen projects, such as NortH2, FUREC and Eemshydrogen, to help to green the industry.   ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"World’s first: RWE builds wind turbines on  a sea dike dam in the Netherlands ","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2021-10-20-rwe-builds-windturbines-on-sea-dike-dam-in-netherlands","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-renewables\/2021\/2021-10-20-worlds-first-rwe-builds-windturbines-on-sea-dike-dam-in-netherlands.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":8780,"text":"Première: RWE commissions its first onshore wind farm in France    * Les Pierrots wind farm supplies over 15,000 homes with green electricity   * Start of construction planned for three further French onshore wind farms in 2021     ### Essen, 22 October 2021  “We are delighted to celebrate our French onshore première today. I am proud of the team who did fantastic work and got the project over the line safely and on time despite all the challenges posed by the pandemic. I want to thank each and every team member! Les Pierrots marks an important milestone and reiterates our ambitions to grow our business in France. We will start construction on three further wind farms in France this year. By swiftly expanding renewables we are supporting France in its efforts to decarbonise its economy and achieve its climate targets.”   ####  Katja Wünschel, COO Wind Onshore & Photovoltaic Europe & Asia-Pacific at RWE Renewables   With the commissioning of Les Pierrots onshore wind farm, RWE is successfully building its renewables portfolio in France. The company invested over 33 million euros in its first French onshore wind farm, located some 250 kilometres south of Paris. Its eleven Nordex turbines (type N117 2400 TS98) have a total installed capacity of 26.4 megawatts (MW). This means that the wind farm could produce enough green electricity to supply the equivalent demand of over 15,000 French households.  Joseph Fonio, Country Chair RWE Renewables France: “Thanks to the excellent work of the entire team we got Les Pierrots connected to the grid on schedule. Our colleagues can draw on the combined experience of many years in developing and constructing wind farms and have extensive knowledge of the specific local conditions. I also want to thank all local stakeholders who have supported the Les Pierrots project every step of the way.”   Lasting collaboration   RWE has entered into a three-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Statkraft for Les Pierrots. The agreement provides for the green electricity being brought to market within the framework of French subsidy programmes. Statkraft is managing sales of the electricity produced.   As one of the global leaders in the renewables sector, RWE took over a development pipeline with onshore wind and solar projects with a total capacity of 2.7 gigawatts (GW) in 2020. Most of that capacity, 1.9 GW, are located in France. RWE is planning to commission two further wind farms in 2022: Les Hauts Bouleaux and Martinpuich.

The country is seeing continued expansion of renewables and we are happy to contribute to the energy transition in Spain with our two new ground-mounted solar farms. Once completed in 2022, these projects will further strengthen our already strong renewables footprint in Spain as well as our global solar portfolio.”   ####  Katja Wünschel, COO Wind Onshore & Solar PV Europe & APAC of RWE Renewables   RWE is making good progress in expanding its solar business in Europe: Having recently commissioned its first ground-mounted solar farm in the Netherlands, the company is now realising two new solar projects in Spain. The solar farms Casa Valdes and Puerta del Sol are located in the Province of Guadalajara, close to Madrid. Both solar farms will have a capacity of 44 megawatts (MWac) each. Early construction works were already kicked-off and full commissioning is expected in summer 2022.  For both solar projects RWE will use innovative, bifacial high-performance modules. The advantage: The bifacial cells are embedded in a double-sided glass-module by which the solar radiation can be absorbed from both sides - the front and the back of the module.  “The bifacial technology will help us to increase the production of the 190,000 modules, which our teams will install”, explains Robert Navarro, President and Managing Director of RWE Renewables Iberia. “After full commissioning our solar farms will be able to supply the equivalent of approximately 61,000 Spanish homes with green electricity and will make a substantial contribution to reach the local climate targets.”  Strong renewables footprint in Spain  RWE has gained considerable experience in Spain and already operates onshore wind farms with a total capacity of more than 440 MW, as well as small hydropower plants in the country. The company is also involved in a photovoltaic plant in the Spanish province of Toledo and in the solar thermal power station Andasol 3. Furthermore RWE’s ground-mounted solar farm Alarcos went into operation last year. This solar farm has a capacity of 45 MWac and is located south of the city of Ciudad Real in the Autonomous Community Castilla-La Mancha.  RWE has an operational renewables portfolio with an installed capacity of more than 9 gigawatts (GW) and is currently constructing photovoltaic plants with a total capacity of 1.2 GW worldwide. In terms of further investments in solar, RWE is actively developing projects in several countries in Europe as well as in North America with a total capacity of more than 7.6 GW.

{"id":8792,"text":"Green steel: Partners to build pioneering direct reduction test plant with hydrogen in Lingen    * Government of Lower Saxony confirms funding for research project    * RWE, CO2GRAB, LSF and BENTELER Steel\/Tube to test technologies for CO2-free steel production   * Direct reduction test plant to be commissioned in 2022    ### Lingen\/Essen, 18 November 2021  Hydrogen will play a key role on the path towards decarbonising the steel industry. But how can the energy source of the future be used to produce climate-neutral steel in a cost-effective manner? Over the next three years the companies RWE, CO2GRAB, LSF and BENTELER Steel\/Tube will conduct research in this area. Today, Olaf Lies, Minister for Environment, Energy, Building and Climate Protection in Lower Saxony announced the state’s commitment to providing €3 million of funding to the CO2GRAB start-up. In 2022, the pioneering demonstration project for a green hydrogen direct reduction plant is to be built on RWE’s Lingen power plant site.  Olaf Lies: “Only a few years ago, a lot of people would not have taken it seriously at all, but now it is becoming a reality: the defossilisation of Germany’s steel industry. This is an essential component for the energy transition to succeed. And it sends another message to the world, that with expertise, determination and conviction we are bringing together objectives that would have been considered incompatible not too long ago. It is of vital importance to support: climate protection and energy transition whilst future-proofing Germany as a home for industry. I am therefore delighted to support this project in contributing towards solving this mammoth task.”  Lingen’s Lord Mayor Dieter Krone points out: “This collaboration shows the clear commitment of everyone involved in the project to innovation and climate protection. Once again Lingen will become a centre for research and development and one of Germany’s most important hydrogen locations.  In green direct reduction, iron ore is reduced using hydrogen. The hydrogen reacts with the oxygen in the iron ore (iron oxide) and transforms it into sponge iron, also known as “direct reduced iron” (DRI). Unlike in traditional furnaces, steam rather than carbon dioxide is produced using this technology. The sponge iron is then melted down with steel scrap and further processed to make steel. BENTELER Steel\/Tube will in future use this type of steel to produce low-carbon seamless and welded tube solutions. During the first stage of the research project, over 1 ton\/hour of green iron (sponge iron) will be produced using green hydrogen. Green hydrogen is to be produced in electrolysers on the power plant site and fed into the DRI plant.   “This DRI technology has enormous potential in terms of decarbonising the steel industry. The technical expertise of the CO2GRAB start-up, which will build and operate the plant, ideally complements RWE’s knowledge along the entire green hydrogen value chain. LSF will optimise electrolyser operation for fluctuating wind and solar power generation. BENTELER Steel\/Tube will then process the reduced sponge iron further to green steel and climate-neutral quality tubes. With this project we can thus make a significant contribution towards becoming climate-neutral,” the partners said in a joint statement. Commissioning of the demonstration plant is planned for the middle of 2022.   Images for media use are available from the RWE media library.

{"id":8820,"text":"Decommissioning activities at year-end: RWE implements legally mandated exit from coal and nuclear power    * Unit C at Gundremmingen nuclear power plant and three lignite units to close      * Total capacity of affected power stations 2,200 megawatts    ### Essen\/Cologne, 30 December 2021  On New Year’s Eve, as planned, RWE will take a total of 2,200 megawatts (MW) of power station capacity off the grid. One of the facilities to close is Unit C, a boiling water reactor accounting for about 1,300 MW and the last component remaining at Gundremmingen. In the Rhenish lignite mining region, the company is switching off its 300 MW units Neurath B, Niederaussem C und Weisweiler E. “This represents a further step in our rigorous efforts to implement the legally mandated phase-out of nuclear power and coal,” explains RWE Power CEO Dr Frank Weigand. The four power station units earmarked for closure have generated more than 400 billion kilowatt hours of electricity since they were commissioned. That is roughly equivalent to the electricity needs of Berlin, including all businesses and residential households, for a period of 90 years. This process is part of the legally mandated decommissioning roadmap, and the German Federal Network Agency has been notified accordingly.  “The fact these power station units have operated so reliably and safely and have made an important contribution to security of supply is down to the efforts of our skilled, experienced and motivated employees who have worked there over the years,” says Weigand, praising the power station teams. “They deserve our special respect and recognition.”  The next round of decommissioning activities will follow in 2022, beginning on 1 April when a further 300 MW unit at Neurath will be taken off the grid. At the end of that year, RWE Power will shut down the two 600 MW units at the same location, and end briquette production at its factory in Frechen. All in all, a further 1,620 MW in the lignite area will be decommissioned next year. The company will also shut down its Emsland nuclear power plant in Lingen (1,400 MW).  In December 2020, RWE already decommissioned Unit E at its Westfalen Power Station, representing 800 megawatts, and Ibbenbüren Power Station, also accounting for 800 MW. RWE thus no longer operates hard-coal power stations in the United Kingdom and Germany, while in the Netherlands, the coal-fired power stations operated by RWE are being converted to biomass. As set down in Germany’s Coal Phase-Out Act, RWE also shut down the first of its units in the Rhenish lignite mining region, with a generation capacity of 300 MW, at the end of 2020.  Between 2020 and 2022, RWE will thus decommission power stations with a combined capacity of more than 7,000 megawatts.  These shutdowns have huge repercussions for RWE’s employees: By the end of 2023, RWE Power will have cut job numbers in the Rhineland, covering the entire process chain from open-cast mining to maintenance, administration and power generation, by about 3,000. Employee numbers at the Gundremmingen nuclear power station will drop from about 600 at the start of 2017 to about 440 at the end of 2022; the remaining employees will continue working through to the 2030s on post-shutdown operations and deconstruction work at the location. The first step will be to remove the nuclear fuel rods from the reactor and transfer them to the holding basin. The employee cutbacks are being performed in line with principles of social responsibility, including payment of “adaptation allowances” in the lignite area.  Tomorrow’s lignite closures represent a further step in RWE’s carbon reduction strategy, which will enable it to save a further 7 million tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub> per year. At the same time, RWE is rigorously forging ahead with the expansion of renewables. By 2030, the company will have invested €50 billion gross in the expansion of renewables, batteries, storage systems, hydrogen and flexible back-up capacity.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2021-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Decommissioning activities at year-end: RWE implements legally mandated exit from coal and nuclear power","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Power AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-power\/2021-12-30-rwe-implements-legally-mandated-exit-from-coal-and-nuclear-power","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-power-ag\/2021\/2021-12-30-rwe-implements-legally-mandated-exit-from-coal-and-nuclear-power.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The company is erecting three Nordex turbines with a total installed capacity of 11.7 megawatts (MW) and a hub height of 134 metres in Lower Saxony’s Harburg district, around 50 kilometres south of Hamburg. Once they become fully operational in late summer, the turbines will produce enough green electricity to supply 7,500 homes. RWE is making good progress with expanding its wind farm portfolio in Germany. Most recently, the company was granted approval for two onshore wind projects in Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. In its home market of Germany, RWE, with its long-standing wind power experience, operates an onshore business with over 580 MW capacity (pro rata).  “Evendorf is a positive example of how the pace of building additional renewables capacities can be stepped up due to good collaboration with state and local authorities. I want to thank the local stakeholders and the local authority for their great support with this project,” said Jens Edler-Krupp, who is responsible for developing RWE’s German onshore wind farms. Christian Sauer, Lord Mayor of the Egestorf municipality to which Evendorf belongs, points out: “To achieve the ambitious targets of the energy transition, we need onshore wind power. Each wind turbine saves large volumes of climate-damaging CO2. You'd hardly think that three new wind turbines will soon be up and running here. But from late-summer they will be generating large amounts of climate-friendly energy.”  RWE’s ambitions for growth in Germany  RWE will expand its team to develop the regional onshore wind and solar business in Germany and will open seven new offices soon. About 200 new colleagues are to be hired to rigorously drive project development.

Rea Unificado is the latest building block in our ambitious investment and growth programme ‘Growing Green’. Through this, we are also supporting Spain on its path towards the energy transition and are contributing towards strengthening the Spanish economy.”   ####  Katja Wünschel, designated CEO Wind Onshore and PV Europe & Australia, RWE Renewables   RWE is investing more than 40 million euros in its new Rea Unificado wind farm in north-eastern Spain. The 43-megawatt (MW) wind farm is to be built in Soria, approximately 160 kilometres east of Saragossa. The nine Nordex wind turbines will be erected from Spring 2022, with the wind farm due to have commenced operation by the end of this same year.  The company is building nine turbines with a nominal capacity of 4.8 megawatts (MW) each – by far the largest in size and capacity within its Spanish fleet. Once it is fully operational, Rea Unificado will be able to supply 30,000 homes with carbon-neutral electricity. In addition, existing infrastructure will be utilised optimally by connecting the wind farm to an existing substation nearby.  RWE as the engine powering Spain’s drive towards climate neutrality  Due to its geographic situation, attractive external conditions and ambitious climate targets, Spain is ideally positioned to expand wind and solar power facilities. According to the national energy and climate plan, a total of 157 gigawatts (GW) of generation capacity are to be installed in the country by 2030, with 50 GW from wind power alone. As one of the global leaders in the renewables sector, RWE already operates onshore wind farms with a total capacity of 440 megawatts in Spain, as well as some smaller hydroelectric power stations. In addition, the company is currently working on two new solar farms with a capacity of 88 MW. Last year, RWE commissioned the Alarcos ground-mounted solar power station with a capacity of 45 MW. Furthermore, the company is involved in a photovoltaic plant in the province of Toledo and the Andasol 3 solar-thermal power plant.  The energy group is currently constructing onshore wind farms in the US, the UK, France, Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany. By 2030, RWE will expand its installed onshore wind and solar capacity from seven to 20 gigawatts.

{"id":8846,"text":"RWE drives expansion of renewables: Two new wind farms for Germany    * Two projects awarded in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony with total capacity of more than 45 megawatts    * Construction to begin in a few months    ### Essen, 10 March 2022  “It will take a huge effort if Germany is to draw almost all of its electricity from renewable energy by 2035. This shows how important it is to accelerate the expansion of renewable energy. RWE wants to contribute to this, especially in its home market of Germany, and implement every project that is possible. The wind farms in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony are good examples of this. By the end of the decade, we plan to invest up to 15 :billion euros gross in our green core business here in Germany.”   ####  Katja Wünschel, CEO Wind Onshore and Solar Europe & Australia, RWE Renewables   Double success for RWE in onshore wind power infrastructure auction: The German Federal Network Agency has awarded it the Grevenbroich wind farm in North Rhine-Westphalia and the Bartelsdorf 2 project in Lower Saxony. These positive decisions will help RWE to accelerate its expansion of renewables in Germany. This year alone, the company is investing about €60 million into three new onshore construction projects, including Sandbostel-Bevern in addition to Grevenbroich and Bartelsdorf 2.  In specific terms, three Nordex units are being constructed at the location in the Rhenish mining region, accounting for 5.7 megawatts (MW) each. The scheduled start date for the Grevenbroich wind farm, with a total installed capacity of 17.1 MW, is as early as the second quarter of 2022, and it is expected to go into operation at the end of this year.   In the rural district of Rotenburg (Wümme) between Hamburg and Bremen, RWE will add five Nordex turbines to its existing wind farm Bartelsdorf, taking the total to 21. This will give the wind farm an additional 28.5 MW of capacity. The start of construction in this case is planned for the summer of 2022, with commissioning in 2023. A special aspect in this case is that two of the newly constructed units will pass to Bürgergesellschaft Heidland Wind GmbH & Co. KG, a local citizens’ cooperative, while the others will be operated by RWE. This is one way in which RWE is continuing its successful collaboration with local partners.  Sustainable growth to 2030  Both onshore projects are part of RWE’s “Growing Green” strategy. By the end of the decade, the company will have invested €50 billion gross in its core business, expanding its green generation capacity to 50 gigawatts. In Germany alone, it aims to invest up to €15 billion gross in offshore and onshore wind, solar, batteries, flexible generation and hydrogen. To further maintain the pace of expansion, RWE has advertised 200 new positions for the development of onshore wind and utility-scale photovoltaic plants in Germany.

{"id":8864,"text":"Repowering project completed: RWE puts Krusemark-Ellingen wind farm into operation    * Total generating capacity up by a quarter, from 15.7 to 19.8 MW   * Innovative recycling concept for old turbines, towers and foundations    ### Essen, 21 April 2022  “Replacing older wind turbines with new, much more efficient ones is part of our growth offensive for renewable energy. If the energy transition is to be accelerated and Germany is to be almost completely supplied with green electricity exclusively as early as 2035, we all have to play our part. RWE intends to invest up to 15 billion euros gross in its green core business by 2030 for climate protection and security of supply.”   ####  Katja Wünschel, CEO Wind Onshore and Solar Europe & Australia, RWE Renewables   More power for the Krusemark-Ellingen wind farm in Saxony-Anhalt: The decision has recently been taken to “repower” this project, which was initially constructed between 1998 and 2004, and the sixth and last new wind turbine has been put in place. The state-of-the-art Nordex turbines, each with a generation capacity of 3.3 megawatts (MW), replace the 15 existing Enercon systems, resulting in a substantial increase in the wind farm’s generation capacity overall, despite the lower number of rotors. The location now has a total installed capacity of 19.8 MW, compared to “only” 15.7 MW previously. That represents an increase of about a quarter. The new systems can provide a climate-neutral supply of electricity to more than 13,000 households.   Krusemark-Ellingen is RWE’s third repowering project in Germany. Replacing older systems with a smaller number of much more powerful turbines makes it possible to extend the life cycle of many locations. Studies confirm that simply installing state-of-the-art systems at established sites in Germany has the potential to boost wind power generation to more than 210 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2030 (2020: 132 TWh). To put this in context, 210 TWh represents approximately 37 percent of Germany’s gross electricity consumption in 2020. Repowering can therefore be an important tool in achieving the German government’s greatly increased expansion targets for renewables. These are ambitious goals, and RWE wishes to make a significant contribution: It is bolstering its team accordingly, with 200 new employees to be appointed in the short term to forge ahead with project development in Germany.   Krusemark-Ellingen is a showcase project for RWE in many regards: “For the first time we are dismantling existing turbines and simultaneously installing new systems,” says Jens Edler-Krupp, who is responsible for developing RWE’s German onshore wind farms. “As a result, it’s possible to keep the old systems running and generating electricity for as long as possible. In addition, the wind farm now consists of just six matching turbines instead of the original 15, which were not completely uniform.” This project, in the rural district of Stendal, also breaks new ground in the important area of recycling. Most of the decommissioned Enercon turbines are being sold as complete sets, including the steel towers, to be re-used on other wind farms. “And part of the material from the old foundations is being put to use at the same location as a base course for the new access roads,” Edler-Krupp adds.

{"id":8865,"text":"RWE to deliver solar power produced at Inden opencast mine from summer    * Start of construction for innovative combination of 26,500 modules and battery storage   * Photovoltaic plant to run from 2022 until completion of Lake Inde       ### Cologne\/Essen, 26 April 2022  In only a few weeks’ time, RWE’s Inden Opencast Mine will no longer produce just lignite, but also solar power. After officially breaking ground, building work has commenced for a utility-scale photovoltaics system with integrated battery storage. The solar modules will produce a peak electric output of 14.4 megawatts (MW). The “RWE indeland Solarpark” is the first of its kind in Europe and combines around 26,500 solar modules and a battery storage system. The plant is expected to be commissioned by late summer this year.  The plant is named after the Inden opencast mining region where it is located, in the district of Düren, North Rhine-Westphalia. Lignite mining will end in seven years and leave an extensive lake – the centre of a dramatically changing landscape. District Administrator Wolfgang Spelthahn, Mayor Stefan Pfennings and indeland Managing Director Jens Bröker all work closely with RWE on shaping the future of this area. Together with RWE Renewables CEO Onshore Wind and Solar Katja Wünschel and RWE Power CTO Dr Lars Kulik, they officially launched the construction work for the plant.  The solar modules will be installed in two 1.4-kilometre-long and 100-metre-wide rows on a gravelled surface at the western edge of the opencast mine. After the end of mining operations in 2029, the area will be at the edge of the lake. However, it will take two decades before water reaches this area – paving the way for the delivery of this innovative large scale solar farm with battery storage. That is exactly what RWE proposed to the German Federal Network Agency as part of a tender for innovation initiatives – and which it won last year.  The battery storage system is designed for a two-hour charging and supply cycle of 9.6 megawatt hours, functioning as a buffer between generation and grid. In this way, feed-in can be even better tailored to meet demand.   Katja Wünschel, CEO Onshore Wind and Solar Europe & Australia at RWE Renewables: “We are investing 11 million euros in our new project at the Inden opencast mine. This makes RWE indeland solar farm the next building block of a climate-friendly and more import-independent electricity production.” RWE is planning to build at least 500 megawatts of generation capacity from renewable sources in the Rhenish lignite mining district alone. Katja Wünschel: “We are making North Rhine-Westphalia one of the centres in our innovation and growth strategy. Here, we want to implement every wind and solar project possible and thus help to shape the enormous transformation, especially in the Rhenish mining district.”  Dr Lars Kulik, CTO Lignite at RWE Power: “Energy transition and structural change in the Rhenish mining district are progressing well with projects like the RWE indeland solar farm. There is plenty of space for renewables facilities on the areas previously used for opencast mining – the mining district will thus remain an energy location in the future.”   Next to the new solar generation and storage project, RWE operates the indeland wind farms Eschweiler and Fronhoven A; they are also joint projects with regional partners, as are the Königshovener Höhe and Bedburg A 44n wind farms near the Garzweiler opencast mine. RWE already operates or is currently building wind parks with a total installed capacity of around 200 MW in the Rhenish mining district. Further wind farm and PV projects are in planning, for example in the Garzweiler opencast mine and its immediate neighbourhood.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE to deliver solar power produced at Inden opencast mine from summer","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2022-04-26-rwe-to-deliver-solar-power-produced-at-inden-opencast-mine-from-summer","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-renewables\/2022\/2022-04-26-rwe-to-deliver-solar-power-produced-at-inden-opencast-mine-from-summer.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The partnership centres on driving forward the production of carbon-neutral steel, with a plan to replace coal with wind power and green hydrogen as the main source of energy in steel production at ArcelorMittal’s steelmaking sites in Germany.  To decarbonise its production sites in Bremen, Hamburg, Eisenhüttenstadt and Duisburg as planned, ArcelorMittal Germany needs renewable energy on a large scale.  RWE and ArcelorMittal are assessing options for joint participation in tenders for offshore wind farm sites in the North Sea. The amendment of the \"Wind Energy at Sea Act\" (WindSeeG) currently under way is crucial for success, as it will permanently shape the cost structure in the German offshore wind sector. If the law were to establish \"negative bids\" in offshore wind tenders, financing wind farms would be more challenging and send the wrong pricing signals to the market by making wind power unnecessarily expensive. Competitive electricity prices are absolutely necessary, if energy-intensive industries such as the steel industry, which operates in a competitive global environment, are to have a future in Germany. RWE and ArcelorMittal strongly believe that with the right steer, green steel from Germany can become a benchmark worldwide for low-carbon emissions steel production.  RWE and ArcelorMittal also want to work together on the development of green hydrogen, by jointly looking for areas where electrolysis plants can be built to supply the steel production sites in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, starting with a 70 MW pilot plant by 2026 with the clear intention to increase to Gigawatt-scale projects in the long term - subject to approval of public funding.  With the combination of RWE’s expertise in offshore wind farms and electrolysers, and ArcelorMittal as a guaranteed buyer of the green electricity and hydrogen, the two companies believe they have excellent opportunities for a viable partnership arrangement. RWE and ArcelorMittal intend to conclude long-term purchase agreements for both wind power and green hydrogen.  Sven Utermöhlen, CEO Offshore Wind, RWE Renewables: “Electricity from renewable energies and green hydrogen must become the hallmark of industrial production in Germany. Industry needs both in large quantities as soon as possible in order to achieve its climate targets. That is why we are planning one of the most ambitious expansion projects for offshore wind farms and electrolysers in Germany, together with ArcelorMittal. If the regulatory framework is right, we want to be successful together in the bidding for offshore areas. ArcelorMittal is an excellent partner to expand our industry cooperation and thus give real impetus to decarbonisation projects in Germany.”  Reiner Blaschek, CEO ArcelorMittal Germany, comments: “ArcelorMittal Germany is embarking on a radical transition to ensure we reach our CO2 emissions reduction targets, meaning that the energy used to make steel will need to be clean energy. The partnership we have announced with RWE today is significant for a number of reasons: it will provide us with the renewable, affordable electricity and green hydrogen that we need to produce low-emissions steel while remaining competitive in a global market. It also offers vital security in the supply chain, by integrating the supply of energy and hydrogen into our business. We are looking forward to working with RWE on this highly important project and benefiting from their experience and know-how, as we continue to lead the industry in the decarbonisation of steelmaking in Germany and beyond.”  As the world’s leading steel producer, ArcelorMittal has ambitious climate action goals, including a target to reduce CO2 emissions by 35% by 2030 in Europe, and a group-wide target to be carbon neutral by 2050. By 2030, ArcelorMittal is aiming to exceed this target in Germany, by moving away from coal-intensive blast furnace technology to electric arc furnaces (EAFs) and direct reduction (DRI) plants. They also plan to gradually replace natural gas with green hydrogen as the fuel for these facilities, once it is cost-competitive at scale.  In addition to the partnership on renewable electricity and green hydrogen, the companies want to investigate possible uses for ArcelorMittal’s low-emissions steel in components for RWE's renewable electricity plants. RWE wants to be climate-neutral by 2040. To achieve this goal, the energy company needs to decarbonise its supply chain, and the use of low-emissions steel will make an important contribution to this.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE and ArcelorMittal intend to jointly build and operate offshore wind farms and hydrogen facilities, for low-emissions steelmaking","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2022-06-22-rwe-and-arcelormittal-mou-to-build-and-operate-offshore-wind-farms-and-hydrogen-facilities","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/documents\/07-presse\/rwe-ag\/2022\/2022-06-22-rwe-and-arcelormittal-to-build-and-operate-offshore-wind-farms-and-hydrogen-facilities.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

Once completed in 2023, this project will further strengthen our already strong renewables footprint on the Iberian Peninsula as well as our global solar portfolio.”  ####  Katja Wünschel, CEO Onshore Wind and PV Europe & Australia, RWE Renewables:   RWE is making good progress in expanding its solar business in Europe: having last year kicked-off the construction for two ground-mounted solar farms, and plans to start construction of another one in Spain this summer, the company is now realising a new photovoltaic (PV) project in Portugal. The solar farm with a planned capacity of 44 megawatts (MWac) is located south of Lisbon in Morgavel, Sines. With around 3,000 hours of sun per year, this is one of the sunniest regions of the country.     For this solar project, RWE will use bifacial high-performance modules. The advantage: the bifacial cells are embedded in a double-sided glass-module by which the solar radiation can be absorbed from both sides - the front and the back of the module.     Early construction works have already kicked-off. The installation of more than 91,000 solar panels is expected to start in late summer on an area of about 100 hectares. The construction works for the PV plant will be carried out by Omexom Portugal. Construção e Manutenção Eletromecânica (CME) is the contractor for the substation and grid connection works.     After full commissioning in 2023, RWE’s Morgavel photovoltaic plant will be able to supply the equivalent of approximately 42,000 Portuguese homes with green electricity and will make a substantial contribution to reach the local climate targets.     As one of the leading renewable energy companies, RWE is operating photovoltaic plants worldwide – including Limondale, which is with a capacity of 249 MWac one of the largest solar farms in Australia. Further solar projects are in development or already under construction with a strong focus on implementing innovative solutions. This year the company has completed its first floating photovoltaic project on a lake in the Netherlands. In addition, RWE is currently constructing solar plants with integrated battery storage systems and is looking into the development of agricultural photovoltaic plants.     As part of its ambitious “Growing Green” growth strategy RWE is massively stepping up the pace and is investing €50 billion gross in its core business in this decade. That means an average of €5 billion gross each year for offshore and onshore wind, solar, batteries, flexible generation and hydrogen. In onshore wind and solar, RWE is expanding its installed capacity from 7 gigawatts to 20 gigawatts by 2030.

The new onshore wind farm will be located near the town of Żnin in Kujawsko-Pomorskie, about 260 kilometers east of Szczecin.     “The investment made by RWE is part of the direction the municipality and the entire region is taking towards green energy. We are already installing photovoltaic systems on public buildings and encouraging residents to replace their heat sources. Thanks to the investment by one of the world's leading energy companies, the grid will now be powered by green electricity in about ten months, benefiting the environment in Poland. As part of the wind farm community package significant funds will be donated to the our town thus meeting the expectations of residents who want to live in an ecological region,” says Robert Luchowski, the Mayor of Żnin.     The entire park will consist of 16 wind turbines. RWE has secured support in the auction system (CfD, Contract for Difference) for the Żnin project with a capacity of 48 megawatts (MW).     “The construction work to prepare the infrastructure, such as path work and the pouring of the foundations, will now begin. The construction of a wind farm also offers benefits to the farmers in the surrounding area: We will create new access roads and pavements. This will facilitate access to the fields and thus improve daily operations. At the beginning of 2023, the community of Żnin will be able to watch the process of installation of wind turbines,” says Wojciech Borkowski, who is responsible for project implementation at RWE Renewables Poland.     The wind farm is scheduled to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of next year.         Expansion of green energy in Poland   A few weeks ago, RWE successfully commissioned its 16th Rozdrażew wind farm with a capacity of 16.8 MW. After fourteen months of construction, the seven turbines generate enough green power to meet the needs of more than 27,000 Polish households.      In western Poland, about 100 kilometers from Szczecin, in the municipality of Mieszkowice, RWE is building another wind farm: two wind turbines will produce enough green energy to meet the annual electricity needs of another 8,800 households. The Polish government has signed a 15-year CfD with the company for the 7 MW Wierzchlas project.     In addition to the Wierzchlas wind farm, the Dolice (48 MW) and Lech Nowy Staw III (12 MW) wind farms are also awaiting permits. RWE is diversifying its Polish renewable energy portfolio by investing in photovoltaic projects. RWE is also active in the offshore sector in Poland. The company is at an advanced stage of preparation for the construction of the 350 MW F.E.W. Baltic II project and has submitted applications for new permits in the Baltic Sea.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"RWE begins construction of Polish wind farm Żnin","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2022-06-30-start-of-construction-polish-wind-farm-znin","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/Pressarticle\/PDF\/2022\/06\/2022-06-30-start-of-construction-polish-wind-farm-znin-en-RWE.pdf","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}
{"id":8903,"text":"After Indre and Pas-de-Calais, RWE inaugurates its third wind farm in France    * Les Hauts Bouleaux, a wind farm with a total capacity of 18 megawatts, will supply more than 9,000 French households with green electricity every year   * Valuable help from local residents during the construction phase    ### Essen, 5 July 2022  RWE inaugurates its second wind farm in the Hauts-de-France region and its third in France. The municipality of Thieux is the site of the six wind turbines of the Les Hauts Bouleaux wind farm with a total capacity of 18 megawatts (MW), i.e. 3 MW per turbine. The park is able to supply more than 9,000 households with green electricity.   Joseph Fonio, Country Chair RWE Renewables France: “Les Hauts Bouleaux is the third wind farm in our portfolio to be commissioned in France and RWE will have seven wind farms in France by the end of the year. With RWE starting operations in the French market in November 2020, less than two years ago, we are pleased to see these projects come to fruition under the RWE brand. The success of a wind power project depends on the support of the local residents and their commitment, which is why we have in-house consultation experts who have a special relationship with the residents, and this is what makes us different. What is even more remarkable in the case of Hauts Bouleaux is the solidarity of the farmers during the connection phase of the park and we would like to thank them warmly.”   The site was commissioned in the spring of 2022 and was delivered on time thanks in part to the valuable help of local residents. Last autumn, torrential rains had an impact on the construction site. Local farmers helped the construction teams to dry out the land with pumps and tankers so that the six wind turbines could be connected to the electricity grid.  RWE is currently building four other onshore wind farms in France: the extension of the Epine Marie-Madeleine wind farm (22.8 MW), Moulin à Vent (6 MW), Montagne d'Huilly (15 MW) and Les Nouvions (43.6 MW), which will bring the total capacity in operation to almost 150 MW by the end of the year.  RWE is also working on the development of solar projects with five projects in advanced development in France for a total of 50 MWp, as well as 250 MWp under study.   In addition, RWE has been shortlisted for two offshore wind tenders off Normandy (AO4) and southern Brittany (AO5). For the AO6 tender in the Mediterranean with floating wind turbines, RWE has teamed up with Bourbon Subsea Services. The partners have already submitted their pre-qualification documents. RWE currently operates 18 offshore wind farms in five countries with a total capacity of around 3 GW (RWE share). The company develops and builds some of the most innovative offshore wind farms in the world, in particular with its float technology, but also by coupling it with offshore hydrogen production.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","title":"After Indre and Pas-de-Calais, RWE inaugurates its third wind farm in France","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE Renewables","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-renewables\/2022-07-05-cod-les-hauts-bouleaux-frankreich","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/Pressarticle\/PDF\/2022\/07\/2022-07-05-cod-les-hauts-bouleaux-frankreich-en-RWE.pdf?sc_lang=en","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":0.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

This shows that we can make an important contribution to decarbonising the European economy with our projects. With the grants that have been envisaged, we are now developing the two selected projects at full speed in order to bring about final investment decisions quickly and to press ahead with the necessary approval procedures.”  ####  Roger Miesen, CEO of RWE Generation:   Two innovative projects with RWE involvement have been pre-selected for funding by the EU Innovation Fund - one of the world's largest programmes for demonstrating innovative low-carbon technologies.   These are RWE's FUREC project in the Netherlands and an offshore wind farm off the German coast, in whose project company Nordsee Two GmbH RWE holds a 51% stake. The two projects are among a total of 17 projects selected by the EU Innovation Fund for the preparation of grant agreements, which is now underway.     The EU Innovation Fund subsidises breakthrough technologies for renewable energy, energy-intensive industries, energy storage and carbon capture, use and storage.     The selected projects with RWE participation are:     FUREC: Under the name FUREC (Fuse Reuse Recycle), RWE wants to produce hydrogen for the chemical industry and thus contribute to making production processes more sustainable. Household waste from Limburg in the Netherlands is to replace natural gas. The FUREC project supports companies, scientific institutes and the province in their efforts to develop Limburg into a centre for the circular economy and a hydrogen hub between the Dutch seaports and the German Ruhr area. For FUREC, a plant is being built in Limburg to process residual materials into raw material pellets. These will then be converted into hydrogen in another plant in Limburg's Chemelot industrial park, which will be supplied to OCI Nitrogen's fertiliser plants. In this way, the industrial park's natural gas consumption is reduced by more than 280 million cubic metres annually. This corresponds to the annual consumption of about 200,000 households. In this way, the emission of about 500,000 tonnes of CO2 can be avoided per year. The CO2 released during hydrogen production can be captured and stored or possibly used as a raw material in the future. The hydrogen can be marketed locally in the Chemelot industrial park or transported to industrial companies in Rotterdam and the Ruhr area via a corresponding hydrogen infrastructure.      Nordsee Two: RWE (51%) is developing an offshore wind farm off the German coast together with its Canadian partner Northland Power (49%). The wind farm with a planned grid capacity of 433 megawatts (MW) is to be built north of the island of Juist and is scheduled to start commercial operation in 2026. Together, the partners are driving technological advancements in the offshore wind industry. In addition to the newest and most innovative wind turbines   (min 15 MW each), the partners aim to demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of producing hydrogen at sea. For this purpose, an electrolyser is planned to be integrated into the offshore wind farm. The green hydrogen could then be used for vessel fueling and to supply emergency power to the offshore substation or wind turbines.  ### Downloads    * Press release","company_name":"RWE","published_on":"2022-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Boost for RWE's hydrogen and offshore business:  Two projects selected for EU Innovation Fund grants","emissions_rank":1,"language":"English","article_category":"RWE AG","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/en\/press\/rwe-ag\/2022-07-14-zwei-projekte-fuer-zuschuesse-aus-eu-innovation-fund-ausgewaehlt","pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.rwe.com\/-\/media\/RWE\/Pressarticle\/PDF\/2022\/07\/2022-07-14-zwei-projekte-fuer-zuschuesse-aus-eu-innovation-fund-ausgewaehlt-en-RWE.pdf?sc_lang=en","error_text":"","carbon_in_title":0.0,"carbon_in_text":1.0,"entities":[],"relations":[],"label":["positive"]}

The first turbine equipped with recyclable blades is generating electricity. The expansion of renewable energies must be driven forward decisively. Faster offshore expansion is particularly important to simultaneously achieve climate targets and to create more energy sovereignty. We at RWE want to help make this happen and the commissioning of the first turbine of our Kaskasi offshore wind farm is a clear sign of this intent.”  ####  Sven Utermöhlen, CEO Wind Offshore, RWE Renewables   35 kilometres north of the island of Heligoland, the first turbine of RWE’s Kaskasi offshore wind farm was recently commissioned, and is now supplying green electricity to the grid. Nine of the in total 38 Siemens Gamesa SG 8.0-167 DD Flex offshore wind turbines are installed, each with a capacity of close to 9 megawatts (MW). Kaskasi is RWE’s sixth wind farm off the German coast. When fully operational by the end of 2022, Kaskasi will be capable of supplying the equivalent of more than 400,000 German households with green electricity every year. This is comparable to a large city like Frankfurt am Main.  World’s first recyclable wind turbine blades installed     RWE is leading the technological development in the offshore wind industry. Together with Siemens Gamesa, the Kaskasi project now features the world’s first installed recyclable wind turbine blades. The components of the 81-meter long RecyclableBlades are able to be recycled for new applications at the end of their lifecycle. RWE and Siemens Gamesa are helping to pave the way towards the full recyclability of wind turbines.     Many components of a wind turbine already have established recycling practices. Until now, the composite materials used in wind turbine blades have been more challenging to recycle. The resin system employed binds all components together. In its RecyclableBlade, Siemens Gamesa uses a resin type with a chemical structure that makes it possible to efficiently separate it from other components following decommissioning. The process protects the properties of the materials, allowing them to be reused in new casting applications, for example in the automotive industry or in consumer goods like flight cases and flatscreen casings.     Tailwind for RWE and the energy transition in Germany  RWE is one of the leading companies in the field of renewable energies and No. 2 worldwide in offshore wind. By 2030, RWE intends to grow its global offshore wind capacity from currently    3 gigawatts (GW) to 8 GW (capacity represents RWE’s share only). Also in Germany, the company is stepping up the pace: In the German North Sea RWE is pushing ahead with the development of four offshore wind projects with a total capacity of 1.5 GW – partly together with its Canadian partner. By 2030, RWE will invest up to 15 billion euros gross in the green energy sector in Germany.  For more information about the Kaskasi offshore project, please visit our website.

{"id":8915,"text":"RWE invests more than €5 billion in green technologies in current fiscal year     * New wind farms, solar plants and battery systems with an installed capacity of 1.2 gigawatts commissioned in the first half of 2022 – about 20% more electricity generated from renewables      * Green assets with a total capacity of 4.8 gigawatts currently under construction in 11 countries      * At €1.6 billion, adjusted net income exceeds level in first half of previous year    ### Essen, 11 August 2022  “In the first half of 2022 our earnings increased significantly, and on the back of this we have raised our forecast for the whole year. The earnings we are generating will benefit the energy transition. This year alone we are investing more than €5 billion in expanding our green portfolio, which is about 30% more than originally planned. We are investing in offshore and onshore wind, solar, batteries and in ramping up the hydrogen economy. All this is urgently needed in order to make energy supply more independent and climate-neutral.”   ####  Markus Krebber, CEO of RWE AG   RWE is actively forging ahead with the implementation of its Growing Green strategy. In the first half of 2022, the Group invested about €2 billion in the expansion of its green portfolio. Total investments will come to more than €5 billion by the end of 2022. The strong investment activity is paying off: in the first six months of the current year alone, new wind farms, solar plants and battery systems with a total net installed capacity of about 1.2 gigawatts (GW) were commissioned. This increase in capacity and better wind conditions led to RWE generating about 20% more electricity from renewables in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year. The company currently has projects with a total of 4.8 GW under construction. RWE will also acquire the hydrogen-ready 1.4 GW Magnum power station in the Netherlands.  Strong earnings performance in internationally focused core business  At €2,858 million, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) at Group level for the first half of 2022 clearly exceeded the previous year’s figure (H1 2021: €1,751 million). Adjusted EBIT was €2,104 million (H1 2021: €1,042 million).  Adjusted net income also showed an improvement, increasing to €1,566 million (H1 2021: €870 million). RWE thus confirms its provisional figures for the first half of 2022 and the outlook for the current year released on 27 July 2022. The dividend target of €0.90 per share for fiscal 2022 remains unchanged.  In its core business with the Offshore Wind, Onshore Wind\/Solar and Hydro\/Biomass\/Gas segments as well as Supply & Trading, RWE achieved adjusted EBITDA of €2,357 million in the first six months of 2022. The figure for the same period last year was €1,206 million.  Offshore Wind: Adjusted EBITDA in the Offshore Wind segment in the first half of 2022 totalled €632 million, compared to €459 million in the same period the previous year. This significant increase was due mainly to the commissioning of new capacities as well as higher wind levels compared to the previous year. For the current year, RWE expects adjusted EBITDA of between €1.35 billion and €1.6 billion in this segment.  Onshore Wind\/Solar: In the first six months of 2022, adjusted EBITDA in the Onshore Wind\/Solar segment reached €491 million. Earnings were negative in the same period the previous year on account of losses of approximately €400 million due to the extreme weather in Texas. Here, too, additional capacity and more favourable wind conditions had a positive impact. For the current year, RWE expects adjusted EBITDA of between €0.9 billion and €1.1 billion in this segment.  Hydro\/Biomass\/Gas: Adjusted EBITDA in the Hydro\/Biomass\/Gas segment more than doubled to €755 million (prior year: €297 million). This was mainly the result of higher earnings from stronger short-term asset optimisation and higher international generation margins. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment is expected to total between €1.4 billion and €1.7 billion for fiscal 2022.  Supply & Trading: At €545 million, earnings in Supply & Trading exceeded the already high figure of €525 million from the prior year. For the current year, RWE now expects adjusted EBITDA of significantly above €350 million in this segment.  RWE earns less in German coal and nuclear energy business  Adjusted EBITDA in the Coal\/Nuclear segment was €501 million, compared to €545 million for the same period in the previous year. This decline in earnings was expected on account of lower generation levels resulting from power station closures. In addition, electricity production by the German lignite and nuclear power stations had already been sold forward. For the year as a whole, the company expects adjusted EBITDA of between €650 million and €750 million in this segment.  Robust financial situation  The Group’s net assets as at the reporting date of 30 June 2022 totalled €1,892 million (31 December 2021: €360 million). The increase is mainly due to strong cash flows from operating activities and a reduction in provisions for pensions as a result of a market-induced increase in discount rates.

We want to connect Rea Unificado to the grid later this year to support the country in its energy transition. Rea is the first RWE wind farm where we are erecting our wind turbines on innovative 'Soft-Spot® foundations'. They allow us to significantly reduce both construction costs and CO2 emissions while increasing stability.”  ####  Katja Wünschel, CEO Onshore Wind and Solar Europe & Australia, RWE Renewables   In the north-east of Spain, in Soria, RWE is constructing its 40.8-megawatt Rea Unificado wind farm. The company is erecting nine turbines with a rated output of 4.53 megawatts each - by far the largest and most powerful in its Spanish fleet. After commissioning, Rea Unificado will be able to supply 30,000 Spanish households with green electricity.     In its 17th Spanish onshore project, RWE has used 'Soft-Spot® foundations' for the first time. Reinforced concrete spread foundations are used and placed on an EPS layer – an insulating material made of expanded polystyrene. Instead of transferring the loads to the subsoil, the EPS redistributes them to a donut-shaped surface. This increases stability and reduces the diameter of the foundation slabs and volume of the concrete used.      “I would like to thank our development and construction teams for making this innovation in Rea possible. We have been able to significantly reduce our construction effort and material costs and save several tonnes of CO2. Now we are entering the next, decisive construction phase and will successively erect all nine turbines,” explains Robert Navarro, President and CEO RWE Renewables Iberia.     “GES is delighted to support RWE in this new milestone.

{"id":8942,"text":"* Technology from thyssenkrupp reduces carbon dioxide emissions in cement production by up to 40 percent \n  * New cement plant in Kribi, Cameroon will save 120,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year\nthyssenkrupp is to fit the first cement plant with a system for the production of calcined clay for the Dutch-based company Cimpor Global Holdings. The technology developed by thyssenkrupp lowers CO2 emissions in cement production by up to 40 percent. It involves replacing part of the cement clinker with calcined, i.e. thermally activated, clay. Cimpor Global Holdings will use the technology, known as “polysius activated clay”, on an industrial scale at a new plant being built near the Cameroon sea port of Kribi. On completion in fall 2021, the plant will save more than 120,000 tons of CO2 emissions every year.\nAn important building material, cement is produced by an energy-intensive process in which large quantities of carbon dioxide are emitted. “At thyssenkrupp we are convinced that CO2-neutral cement production is fundamentally possible and can be achieved in several steps,” says Pablo Hofelich, CEO of the Cement Technologies business unit. “We are already very advanced in many areas on the technology side. We offer our customers products that reduce environmental impact and at the same time reduce costs, making it possible for example to significantly cut CO2 and nitrogen oxide emissions and reduce the use of raw materials, water, or fossil fuels such as coal and gas.” \nUnder the order, thyssenkrupp is carrying out engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of the new plant, which will produce 720 tons of activated clay per day. It is the second calcined clay project of Cimpor Global Holdings.\nActivated clay significantly reduces CO2 footprint and energy consumption\nCO2 is a natural constituent of limestone, the main component of cement. For each ton of cement clinker produced, around 790 kilograms of process-related CO2 is emitted. Around two thirds of this results from the limestone used, which releases CO2 in a chemical reaction in the production process. At the same time the process requires large amounts of energy, because for the production of cement clinker, limestone has to be heated with other aggregates to temperatures of more than 1,400 degrees Celsius. \nWith polysius activated clay, thyssenkrupp has developed a technology that allows around one third of the cement clinker to be replaced with activated clay. The clay is heated to around 800 degrees Celsius – significantly less heat than is needed to produce clinker. Thanks to the significant energy saving in the production of thermally activated clays and the changed chemical composition, CO2 emissions per ton of cement can be cut by up to 40 percent. \nReduced dependence on expensive clinker imports\nClay is available in huge quantities worldwide – particularly also in developing countries with growing cement demand such as in Southeast Asia and large parts of Africa and Latin America. In the past clay has often been discarded as a waste product in mining. With polysius activated clay technology, thyssenkrupp offers an innovative solution for the industrial use of clay as a substitute material and a sustainable, low-cost alternative to conventional cement clinker. \n“Our technology is not only eco-friendlier, it also creates cost advantages for our customers such as Cimpor Global Holdings,” says Dr. Luc Rudowski, Head of Product Management and Innovation at the Cement Technologies business unit. “In many regions, limestone is in short supply and clinker has to be imported at high cost. Also, stricter environmental requirements and emissions levies in more and more countries are forcing cement producers to rethink. They need an alternative that is cost-efficient and at the same time delivers high-quality cement. That’s exactly what polysius activated clay technology provides.” \nClimate-neutral cement production a step closer\nAlongside technology for the production of thermally activated clays, thyssenkrupp is working on further products and processes for the “green” cement plant of the future. One example is Oxyfuel technology. While the use of activated clay helps substantially reduce CO2 emissions and energy consumption, a certain amount of limestone is still needed because it is essential for the strength behavior of concrete.\nWith its pure oxyfuel process, thyssenkrupp has developed a solution for capturing and utilizing the CO2 released from the limestone during clinker production. Instead of ambient air, pure oxygen is used for the combustion process. Because no nitrogen enters the process, the resultant CO2 is highly concentrated and can be separated and stored or reused much more easily, for example as a chemical raw material.\nAbout us:\nThe thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions AG is a leading partner for the engineering, construction and service of industrial plants and systems. Based on more than 200 years of experience we supply tailored, turnkey plants and components for customers in the chemical, fertilizer, cement, mining and steel industries.

{"id":8996,"text":"* A new modular heating system to achieve a 13% decrease in gas consumption for the first year alone, reducing CO2 emissions by 2,500 tons\n  * Various activities are expected to lead to an annual reduction of about three million kW\/h of electricity upon completion\n  * All measures are part of a three-year lean manufacturing roadmap\nBerco, a global leader in the production and supply of undercarriages and components for the world's leading manufacturers of heavy machinery and for the Aftermarket, is aiming to reduce the environmental impact of its production. This has resulted in the initiation of an optimization of its Copparo plant, to meet the environmentally sustainable standards of the coming years.\nThe implementation of this renovation will be carried out over a three-year roadmap to reduce CO2 emissions by 2,500 tons per year as well as the annual consumption of gas by 13%. Various activities in the field of energy efficiency are estimated to lead to an annual reduction of about three million kW\/h of electricity when the project is completed.\nRespective investments have already been implemented or will be planned along the course of the roadmap. \"This project\", comments Andrea Marigo, Head of Integrated Management System Industry Europe at Berco, \"started with an in-depth analysis of the consumption of electricity, water and gas. It is closely connected to our lean manufacturing path which was started three years ago at the Copparo plant and focused on production efficiency, eliminating waste and bringing value to the market.\"\nEquipment with a better energy efficiency and a new modular heating system\nThe first step concentrated on reducing the energy consumption of all the machinery present in the Copparo production lines. To this end, the real use of each machine was analyzed in terms of relative performance. The obsolete, very energy-intensive ones were thus dismantled and, when necessary, replaced with new equipment that have a lower impact on consumption.\nA new modular heating system will be activated in the coming winter months. A 13% reduction in gas consumption for the first year of operation is estimated, with a consequent reduction of as much as 2,500 tons of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. To reduce the consumption of natural gas both for production use and for heating (heating uses both gas and electricity) of the entire Copparo complex, Berco opted to replace the only 20 MW thermal power plant with a series of modern and delocalized thermal energy sources.\nDecentralization of compressed air and electric power to bring energy savings\nThe production and distribution of compressed air, widely used in various production phases within Copparo, has always represented a particularly energy-intensive process in terms of kW\/h. Also in this case, the watchword is decentralization: the massive system with centralized compressors is being replaced by compressors located in the various production areas. Annual savings of around 2.5% compared to the average consumption of the last three years are estimated.\nFurthermore, the decentralized distribution of electrical power will guarantee a better use of energy, with the new system catering to the specific needs of each individual department. The possible use of photovoltaic panels is equally under evaluation. The various activities relating to the production and distribution of compressed air, the modification of the cooling circuits as well as the reorganization of the electrical distribution, are estimated to lead to an annual reduction of about three million kW\/h of electricity when the project is completed.\nLower amount of water required and non-separate waste\nThe current water consumption of the Copparo plant is about 300,000 m3 per year. Taken directly from the Po River, this water is mainly intended for the cooling circuits of the plants. Currently, the cooling circuits are closed and built with evaporative towers, which cool the water by exchanging heat with the surrounding air, before putting it back into circulation.\nThese circuits, however, will be the subject of future analyses and some studies are already at an advanced stage to evaluate important actions to realize decentralized plants in the near future. This would not only be less energy-intensive, but it would also potentially result in the reduction of the dispersion of water through evaporation - therefore less water would be required to be integrated into the system - thanks to new tower configurations.\nIn addition to lowering its energy consumption, Berco has also in recent years focused on ensuring the greatest possible recovery of steel. This goal has been achieved thanks to a careful management of the production process, that distinguishes and separates production waste in the best possible way, avoiding the transfer of non-separated waste.\nThese are the first strong structural changes that Berco already has in store for the next three years and are in line with the important objectives that the Group has set to reduce its carbon footprint. \"In addition to these implementations\", concludes Marigo, \"the completion of the lean transformation of Copparo production, with the consequent strong reduction in the handling of goods within the plant, as well as waste in the treatment of materials, will bring further environmental benefits.\"\nAbout Berco:\nBerco is a global leading manufacturer and supplier of undercarriages for heavy machinery.
