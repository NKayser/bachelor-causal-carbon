{"id":5,"text":"If proved successful, the new concept has the potential to revolutionise blast furnace carbon emissions capture and support the decarbonisation of the transport sector.  The technology in the gas conversion process was pioneered by Chicago-based company, LanzaTech, with whom ArcelorMittal has entered a long-term partnership. The technology licensed by LanzaTech uses microbes that feed on carbon monoxide to produce bioethanol. The bioethanol will be used as transport fuel or potentially in the production of plastics.  This is the first installation of its kind on an industrial scale in Europe and once complete, annual production of bioethanol at Ghent is expected to reach around 80 million litres, which will yield an annual CO2 saving equivalent to putting 100,000 electrical cars on the road. The new installation will create up to 500 construction jobs over the next two years and 20 to 30 new permanent direct jobs. Commissioning and first production is expected by mid-2020.  The application of this microbial gas conversion system significantly advances ArcelorMittal’s carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) capabilities and enhances steel’s role in the circular economy. ArcelorMittal’s long-term aspiration is to become a zero-waste business, with all materials used or generated during steel production recuperated, treated and reused in the production chain or becoming the raw materials for other industries.  \"This new Carbon Smart technology illustrates ArcelorMittal’s commitment to transforming steel production and it will also further strengthen steel’s standing in the circular economy, particularly compared to other higher carbon metals like aluminium.”  \"We are excited that after several years of research and engineering, we are now progressing with the largest project of its kind within the ArcelorMittal group.

{"id":9,"text":"In a manifesto published today, ‘Creating a low carbon world, the case for a Carbon Border Adjustment’, ArcelorMittal sets out its firm belief that a CBA should be one of the first Green Deal measures adopted by the new European Commission, as it will help to create the market conditions and protections needed for companies to make investments and transition to carbon neutrality without disruption.  Currently within the EU, energy-intensive industries including steel producers, pay a carbon cost under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). But this does not apply to steel producers from markets outside the EU who can sell steel with comparable or often significantly higher, carbon emissions, at a lower price. The result is that steel production is moving to non-EU countries where carbon emissions legislation is often less strict, undermining efforts to combat climate change.   However, with a CBA, when steel comes into the EU, the carbon costs that European producers pay would be added to the imported steel, equalising the cost of carbon for every producer to create a fair market and, crucially, encouraging investment in lower-emissions steel production.  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products says: “The EU’s commitment to reduce its carbon emissions to net-zero should be applauded and we hope that decision makers across Europe will back the proposals as they really could hold the key to unlocking solutions that could put a stop to carbon emissions. The climate challenge is unprecedented, and bold action is needed.”  ArcelorMittal believes that a CBA can be applied in various ways, as long as it neutralizes the disparities in carbon costs between domestic products and imports, and incentivizes the transition to low carbon steel production. In the manifesto, ArcelorMittal highlights how the best-designed carbon border adjustment could work effectively:  Producers exporting to the EU should be charged the same marginal carbon emissions cost as European producers pay under the ETS. This should serve as a catalyst to other countries to introduce their own carbon schemes and invest in technologies to decarbonise.  The CBA should initially be applied to primary goods, rather than end products like household appliances and everyday tools. This is the most practical way to introduce the CBA.  To be effective, free allocation of ETS allowances, which are gradually being phased out by the European Commission, should be maintained in the first stage of the CBA, alongside compensation for high energy costs as an indirect result of the ETS. This is crucial to enabling European steel to stay competitive and ensure a smooth transition without disruption.  He says: “There are of course challenges that will need to be overcome. For example, some have argued that there is the risk of contravening international trade rules. However, the establishment of a border adjustment is compatible with international trade rules, allowing members to adopt measures necessary for the protection of the environment or relating to the conservation of natural resources providing that such measures do not constitute arbitrary discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail. But this will only work if the policies are well-designed and drafted in the right way.”   He also says: “We know we need to invest more to decarbonise our industry and we truly believe we can be a world leader in low carbon steel. But in order to do so, we need to have a CBA to create a landscape where others also contribute equally to a carbon-neutral world.

{"id":11,"text":"* Europe’s largest steelmaker, unveils breakthrough technologies that will take the company to 30% lower CO2 emissions by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 2050     * ArcelorMittal Europe is investing in two routes to carbon neutrality, Smart Carbon and an innovative DRI-based route, in recognition of the need to act now to reduce CO2 emissions, in line with the EU’s Green Deal and the Paris Agreement   * Calls for new policy framework, to support the industry in its transition to carbon neutrality, naming five market conditions that are needed for Europe’s steelmakers to compete globally     ArcelorMittal Europe has announced details of how it plans to become carbon neutral by 2050 in its first climate action report, published today. Building on the company’s work that has demonstrated that the steelmaking process can become carbon neutral, the report publishes details of the ground-breaking work underway to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030 before reaching net zero in 2050.  The company is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral routes for steelmaking: Smart Carbon, and an innovative DRI-based route.  Smart Carbon is a carbon-neutral steelmaking route that leverages all clean energies – circular carbon, clean electricity and carbon capture and storage (CCS) - within the high temperature-controlled reduction environment of ironmaking. In its first phase, Smart Carbon will primarily use circular carbon.  Reaching carbon-neutral steelmaking via DRI involves moving from using predominantly natural gas, to hydrogen as the key reductant in ironmaking. As this hydrogen becomes ‘green’, the steelmaking process comes close to carbon neutrality.  While both the Smart Carbon route and the DRI-based route have the potential to deliver carbon -neutral steel by 2050, the important difference between the two routes is that Smart Carbon can deliver results sooner, through its use of complementary technologies which enable incremental progress. Uniquely, Smart Carbon has the potential not only to provide carbon-neutral steel, but also carbon-neutral cement, and the building blocks to make recycled carbon materials to replace polyethylene-based plastics. Smart Carbon can also contribute to CO2 removal, through the increased use of circular carbon, using sustainable biomass and waste, combined with scaling up CCS.  By investing in both routes – and in recognition of the need to act now to combat climate change - this means ArcelorMittal Europe can significantly reduce scope 1 CO2 emissions* – which include all process emissions - by 2030 over a 2018 baseline, while waiting for the large-scale, affordable renewable energy needed for hydrogen-based steelmaking.  ArcelorMittal Europe’s 2030 target therefore combines Smart Carbon technologies and increased scrap usage, specifically by developing new ways to increase the use of low-quality scrap metal – which is hard to recycle - in the primary steel production process.  In the longer-term, both routes have the potential to leverage all three clean energies to achieve carbon neutrality, namely:    * clean electricity (generated by sources such as solar and wind),   * circular carbon (making use of biowaste materials, such as sustainable forestry and agriculture residues, to produce bioenergy)   * carbon capture and storage (capturing CO2 before it is emitted, transporting it and storing it safely underground).    Commenting on the report, Aditya Mittal, President and CFO, ArcelorMittal, and CEO ArcelorMittal Europe, said:  “Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing us all. Understandably, much attention is currently focussed on navigating the unexpected and unprecedented outbreak of Covid-19. However, climate change remains a huge long-term challenge that will require diligent attention and progress for decades to come. And like Covid-19, it is not something that one country or one company can solve alone. Carbon emissions also know no border, so it will take a global effort, with all nations and companies playing their part.  “ArcelorMittal Europe is doing a lot of work to develop a path to net zero. The technologies we are working on have the potential to make a big impact. Indeed, steel should and can play a leading role in achieving the vision for Europe as outlined in the Green Deal. Our research and development team are one of the best in the industry and relish solving complex problems. But it needs a team effort. The support the EU and member states can give to ensure we have well-designed policy to make large-scale, competitive, carbon-neutral steelmaking a reality, is critical.”  ArcelorMittal Europe has industrial-scale demonstration projects under construction for every part of its carbon-neutral roadmap. The company is building industrial-scale demonstration plants at its operations in Belgium (Carbalyst® and Torero), France (3D and IGAR in Dunkirk). In Hamburg, Germany, we are in the design and funding phase prior to the investment decision, of an industrial-scale project to use hydrogen instead of natural gas in the direct reduction of iron ore (DRI). These demonstration plants will allow the company to scale-up technologies that will be used in the Smart Carbon and DRI-based routes. The progress made has also been possible thanks to financial support from EU member states and European Union funding. ArcelorMittal Europe is now in the process of applying for funding for a further six projects.   While some of the technologies that feature in ArcelorMittal Europe’s roadmap will be ready for commercial-scale use by 2025, and by 2030 many of the Smart Carbon technologies can be mature and partially deployed across our facilities in Europe, the report also highlights the need for the right policy framework to enable European steelmaking to contribute to the EU’s climate targets, particularly given the costs involved. In total, the estimated investment needed for ArcelorMittal Europe to fully implement Smart Carbon is €15-25bn and €30-40bn for the DRI-based route. An additional €15–200bn would be required for the associated clean energy infrastructure (see report for more detail).  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, explained:  “I am proud of the work that has brought us this far in our efforts to create Europe’s first and largest carbon-neutral steelmaker. Our progress would not have been possible without the many partners we have on our Smart Carbon and innovative DRI projects. Today, the biggest barrier to transitioning to carbon-neutral steel, beyond the necessary technologies reaching commercial maturity, is the absence of the right market conditions. The financial costs of realising carbon-neutral steelmaking are undeniably huge. However, with a shift in market conditions brought about by having the right policies in place, European steelmakers will be able to unlock the means to reduce emissions from steel globally, while also ensuring the European steel industry remains competitive.”  The medium-term market conditions needed include:    1. Creating an environment where carbon-neutral steel is more competitive than steel which is not carbon neutral         2. A fair competitive landscape that accounts for the global nature of the steel market, addressing domestic, import and export steel dynamics, as well as the distinction between primary and secondary sources to make steel.         3. Access to sustainable finance, to innovate and make long-term investments.         4. Access to abundant, affordable clean energy: the scale of the steel industry’s energy needs are such that concerted cross-sector and government efforts will be required to develop the necessary clean energy infrastructure.         5. Public instruments to accelerate innovative technology deployment to transition to carbon neutral steelmaking.    The report also reiterates the company’s position that a Carbon Border Adjustment should be introduced in the European Union, which would ensure that EU-produced steel and imported steel tonnes in direct competition would have an equal carbon cost, creating a fair market and, crucially, encouraging investment in lower-emissions steel production.  ArcelorMittal Europe announced its target to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, in December 2019, and its ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050, in June 2019.  The ArcelorMittal group will publish its 2030 target later this year.   *ArcelorMittal Europe 30% CO2 reduction target includes: ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products, and Industeel  To read the report and view a short film about our roadmap, visit https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/sustainability\/climate-action-in-europe  To view our Carbon Border Adjustment animation, ‘Creating a low-carbon world, the case for a Carbon Border Adjustment’ visit https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T-iJeVoa7w0","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe sets out path to net zero by 2050, with pioneering technologies at the forefront of the company’s roadmap for carbon-neutral steelmaking","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Europe sets out path to net zero by 2050, with pioneering technologies at the forefront of the company’s roadmap for carbon-neutral steelmaking","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-europe-sets-out-path-to-net-zero-by-2050-with-pioneering-technologies-at-the-forefront-of-the-company-s-roadmap-for-carbon-neutral-steelmaking\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":46,"from_id":93,"to_id":94,"type":"causality"},{"id":47,"from_id":93,"to_id":95,"type":"causality"},{"id":48,"from_id":93,"to_id":96,"type":"causality"},{"id":49,"from_id":90,"to_id":89,"type":"causality"},{"id":50,"from_id":82,"to_id":83,"type":"causality"},{"id":51,"from_id":77,"to_id":76,"type":"causality"},{"id":52,"from_id":70,"to_id":69,"type":"causality"},{"id":55,"from_id":67,"to_id":920,"type":"property"},{"id":56,"from_id":67,"to_id":921,"type":"property"},{"id":57,"from_id":68,"to_id":920,"type":"property"},{"id":58,"from_id":68,"to_id":921,"type":"property"},{"id":59,"from_id":91,"to_id":922,"type":"property"},{"id":60,"from_id":92,"to_id":924,"type":"property"},{"id":61,"from_id":922,"to_id":920,"type":"reference"},{"id":62,"from_id":924,"to_id":921,"type":"reference"},{"id":63,"from_id":73,"to_id":920,"type":"reference"},{"id":64,"from_id":75,"to_id":921,"type":"reference"},{"id":65,"from_id":87,"to_id":920,"type":"property"},{"id":66,"from_id":87,"to_id":921,"type":"property"}],"entities":[{"id":67,"label":"emissions","start_offset":95,"end_offset":118},{"id":68,"label":"timeline","start_offset":119,"end_offset":126},{"id":69,"label":"effect","start_offset":188,"end_offset":232},{"id":70,"label":"cause","start_offset":304,"end_offset":343},{"id":71,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":164,"end_offset":401},{"id":73,"label":"core reference","start_offset":1206,"end_offset":1271},{"id":75,"label":"core reference","start_offset":1527,"end_offset":1570},{"id":76,"label":"effect","start_offset":1840,"end_offset":1879},{"id":77,"label":"cause","start_offset":1893,"end_offset":1926},{"id":82,"label":"cause","start_offset":3005,"end_offset":3038},{"id":83,"label":"effect","start_offset":3042,"end_offset":3067},{"id":87,"label":"status","start_offset":4641,"end_offset":4699},{"id":88,"label":"core reference","start_offset":5066,"end_offset":5094},{"id":89,"label":"effect","start_offset":5241,"end_offset":5254},{"id":90,"label":"cause","start_offset":5288,"end_offset":5354},{"id":91,"label":"financial information","start_offset":5981,"end_offset":5989},{"id":92,"label":"financial information","start_offset":5994,"end_offset":6002},{"id":93,"label":"cause","start_offset":7904,"end_offset":7928},{"id":94,"label":"effect","start_offset":7997,"end_offset":8094},{"id":95,"label":"effect","start_offset":8107,"end_offset":8118},{"id":96,"label":"effect","start_offset":8147,"end_offset":8193},{"id":918,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":7847,"end_offset":8193},{"id":920,"label":"technology","start_offset":234,"end_offset":246},{"id":921,"label":"technology","start_offset":265,"end_offset":280},{"id":922,"label":"core reference","start_offset":5965,"end_offset":5977},{"id":924,"label":"core reference","start_offset":6011,"end_offset":6026},{"id":925,"label":"technology","start_offset":3080,"end_offset":3397}]}
{"id":12,"text":"Commenting on the 2050 net zero target, before speaking about the challenge of decarbonising the steel industry at the Financial Times Commodities Conference today, Aditya Mittal, President and CFO, said:   “If the world is to achieve net zero by 2050 it will require all parts of the economy in all regions of the world to contribute. As the world’s leading steel company, we believe we have a responsibility to lead the efforts to decarbonise the steel-making process, which today has a significant carbon footprint.   “Steel will remain a vital material for our world and indeed is the most circular of all materials. Our challenge is to be able to make steel using clean energy technologies* on a commercial scale, while remaining competitive in the global steel industry.  “We are working on various pilot technologies which have excellent potential. In Hamburg, where we own and operate Europe’s only DRI-EAF facility, we will test not only the ability of hydrogen to reduce the iron-ore and form DRI, but also then test that carbon-free DRI in the EAF in the actual steel-making process.  “Hydrogen has a lot of potential but given the significant transition cost, we also believe in working on solutions for the traditional integrated route. This essentially follows the bio-energy, carbon capture and utilisation and storage route, which as stressed by both the IPCC and the IEA will be critical to achieving net zero by 2050. What is also interesting about this route is that it has the potential not only to provide carbon neutral steel, but also other products that will help the chemical industry make plastics in a carbon neutral way.   “Critical to turning the target into reality will be policy to enable steel to remain competitive while decarbonizing – particularly given every region of the world is moving at a different pace. We intend to actively engage with governments to chart a way forward that enables the steel industry to make meaningful progress through carefully designed policy that protects against carbon leakage.”  ArcelorMittal has identified two low-emissions steelmaking routes, both of which have the potential to lead to carbon-neutral steelmaking:    * The Hydrogen-DRI route, which uses hydrogen as a reducing agent. A demonstration plant in Hamburg, where ArcelorMittal owns Europe’s only operational DRI-EAF plant, is currently planned with a targeted start-up in 2023.     * The Smart Carbon route is centred around modifying the blast furnace route to create carbon neutral steelmaking through the use of circular carbon - in the form of sustainable biomass or carbon containing waste streams - and carbon capture and use (CCU) and storage (CCS). ArcelorMittal is well advanced on constructing several commercial-scale projects to test and prove a range of Smart Carbon technologies. Start-up target for key projects is targeted in 2022.    While both routes have the potential to deliver carbon-neutral steel by 2050, we believe that Smart Carbon can deliver results sooner, and make a meaningful contribution to CO2 emissions reduction this decade, while industrial scale production from the Hydrogen-DRI route is unlikely to be significant before 2030 due to the current high costs.  The Company has also previously outlined the policy framework environment it believes is required for carbon-neutral steelmaking to become a reality, which includes:    1. A global level playing field which avoids the risk of carbon leakage through mechanisms such as green border adjustments   2. Access to abundant and affordable clean energy   3. Policies which support the development of the necessary clean energy infrastructure   4. Access to sustainable finance for low-emissions steelmaking, and   5. Policies which accelerate the transition to a circular economy.    ArcelorMittal will set out further detail in support of its 2050 net zero target in its second climate action report, which is anticipated to be published before the end of 2020.  ArcelorMittal is a member of the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) and is an active member of the ETC’s Net Zero Steel Initiative underway in partnership with the World Economic Forum. ArcelorMittal is also actively engaged with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) to define an achievable SBT for the steel industry taking into account the two distinct routes in operation today.  *In its Climate Action Report and Europe Climate Action Report, ArcelorMittal refers to three clean energy vectors: clean electricity, circular carbon, and CCS.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2020-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal sets 2050 group carbon emissions target of net zero ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces a group-wide commitment to being carbon neutral by 2050, building on the commitment made in 2019 for its European business to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030, and be carbon neutral by 2050.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-sets-2050-group-carbon-emissions-target-of-net-zero\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":67,"from_id":97,"to_id":109,"type":"property"},{"id":68,"from_id":99,"to_id":109,"type":"property"},{"id":69,"from_id":98,"to_id":109,"type":"reference"},{"id":72,"from_id":110,"to_id":109,"type":"reference"},{"id":73,"from_id":101,"to_id":110,"type":"property"},{"id":74,"from_id":102,"to_id":110,"type":"property"},{"id":75,"from_id":103,"to_id":110,"type":"property"},{"id":76,"from_id":926,"to_id":111,"type":"reference"},{"id":77,"from_id":108,"to_id":111,"type":"reference"},{"id":78,"from_id":927,"to_id":108,"type":"property"},{"id":79,"from_id":107,"to_id":108,"type":"property"},{"id":80,"from_id":114,"to_id":115,"type":"causality"}],"entities":[{"id":97,"label":"location","start_offset":859,"end_offset":866},{"id":98,"label":"core reference","start_offset":962,"end_offset":1006},{"id":99,"label":"emissions","start_offset":1032,"end_offset":1043},{"id":101,"label":"location","start_offset":2284,"end_offset":2291},{"id":102,"label":"status","start_offset":2362,"end_offset":2379},{"id":103,"label":"timeline","start_offset":2387,"end_offset":2412},{"id":107,"label":"timeline","start_offset":2866,"end_offset":2882},{"id":108,"label":"core reference","start_offset":2803,"end_offset":2828},{"id":109,"label":"technology","start_offset":907,"end_offset":914},{"id":110,"label":"core reference","start_offset":2344,"end_offset":2351},{"id":111,"label":"technology","start_offset":2424,"end_offset":2436},{"id":114,"label":"cause","start_offset":3212,"end_offset":3230},{"id":115,"label":"effect","start_offset":3140,"end_offset":3200},{"id":926,"label":"core reference","start_offset":2551,"end_offset":2691},{"id":927,"label":"status","start_offset":2710,"end_offset":2791}]}

Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal have signed an MoU that aims to contribute significantly to the decarbonization of the Dunkirk industrial basin. In the context of the Paris Agreement and the European Commission’s Green Deal, and in line with Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal’s commitments to energy transition, the project will reduce yearly CO2 emissions from ArcelorMittal’s steel-making facilities in Dunkirk by 2.85 Mt by 2030. Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal have jointly applied for large projects funding under the Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) scheme for hydrogen. Funding from European and\/or French schemes supporting decarbonization is key to the implementation of the project.  ArcelorMittal is ready to implement an innovative production unit on its Dunkirk site, combining two steel production technologies – DRI: direct reduced iron unit, and submerged arc furnace – in dimensions never seen before. As a low-carbon technology, the DRI and submerged arc furnace unit will enable the production of steel with lower CO2 emissions. This initiative was the subject of a preliminary study announced by ArcelorMittal last October. It comes in addition to the initiatives already implemented by ArcelorMittal on its Dunkirk site to lower its CO2 emissions.  Air Liquide will support this strategic initiative through the massive supply of low-carbon hydrogen and the implementation of CO2 capture technologies in Dunkirk, one of Air Liquide's historical industrial basins in France. The Air Liquide group has developed a unique expertise both for hydrogen all along the value chain, from production and storage to distribution, as well as CO2 capture technologies. Leveraging this know-how and in line with its Climate objectives, Air Liquide is committed to developing sustainable solutions supporting its customers in the steel industry to reduce carbon emissions.  This partnership between Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal is a first step towards the creation of an ecosystem at the forefront of low-carbon hydrogen and CO2 capture solutions that will be a source of competitiveness and attractiveness for various players in the Dunkirk industrial and port basin.

At ArcelorMittal, we have an important role to play in helping society deliver the objectives of the Paris Agreement and are determined to lead our industry’s transition to carbon neutral steel.  “We have the scale, resources and technological prowess to make a significant impact, and have already identified the routes to carbon neutral steelmaking through our Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI pathways.  “Our launch of XCarb™ today brings the full breadth of our decarbonisation activity together under a single umbrella brand. It aims to demonstrate to stakeholders the diverse range of initiatives we are undertaking in pursuit of our 2050 net zero goal while also providing our customers with solutions which help them address their own carbon reduction targets, demonstrating the important role steel has to play in a future, circular economy.”   The first XCarb™ initiatives to be launched are as follows:  ‘XCarb™ green steel certificates’  Across our ArcelorMittal Europe - Flat Products operations, we are investing in a broad range of initiatives to reduce carbon emissions from the blast furnace. These initiatives range from our flagship Smart Carbon projects, such as Torero (transforming biomass into bio-coal to replace the use of coal in the blast furnace) and Carbalyst (capturing carbon-rich blast furnace waste gas and converting it into bio-ethanol, which can then be used to make low-carbon chemical products) to capturing hydrogen-rich waste gases from the steelmaking process and injecting them into the blast furnace to reduce coal use.  These effort-intensive investments result in considerable CO2 savings, which can be passed onto customers in the form of the steel industry’s first-ever certification scheme. CO2 savings are aggregated, independently assured, and then converted into XCarb™ green steel certificates using a conversion factor that represents the average CO2 intensity of integrated steelmaking in Europe. The scheme therefore provides customers with the opportunity to buy certificates attached to their physical orders of steel, enabling them to report a reduction in their Scope 3 carbon emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The company anticipates it will have 600,000 tonnes of equivalent green steel tonnes available by the end of 2022.  ‘XCarb™ recycled and renewably produced’  ‘XCarb™ recycled and renewably produced’ has been designed for products made via the Electric Arc Furnace (‘EAF’) route using scrap steel. Recycled and renewably produced means that the physical steel was made with recycled material (scrap) using renewable electricity, giving it an extremely low CO2 footprint that can be as low as approximately 300kg of CO2 per tonne of finished steel when the metallics are 100% scrap. This customer offer is for both flat and long products. The electricity used in the steelmaking process is independently verified, with a ‘Guarantee of Origin’ given that it is from renewable sources.  ‘XCarb™ innovation fund’  ArcelorMittal has launched an innovation fund which will invest up to $100 million annually in groundbreaking companies developing pioneering or breakthrough technologies that will accelerate the steel industry’s transition to carbon neutral steelmaking. To be eligible for funding, companies will have to be developing technologies which support ArcelorMittal on its journey to decarbonise. The technology also needs to be commercially scalable. For further detail refer to the separate press release the company has issued today.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal launches XCarb™, signalling its commitment to producing carbon neutral steel","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"(1) Groundbreaking ‘XCarb™ green steel certificates’ offering customers Scope 3 emissions reductions (2) ‘XCarb™ recycled and renewably produced’ pioneering customer product with CO2 as low as 300kg\/tonne (3) ‘XCarb™ innovation fund’ for breakthrough technologies for net zero steelmaking","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-launches-xcarb-signalling-its-commitment-to-producing-carbon-neutral-steel\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":85,"from_id":932,"to_id":931,"type":"reference"},{"id":86,"from_id":127,"to_id":128,"type":"causality"},{"id":87,"from_id":132,"to_id":133,"type":"causality"},{"id":88,"from_id":131,"to_id":130,"type":"reference"},{"id":89,"from_id":134,"to_id":130,"type":"property"},{"id":90,"from_id":136,"to_id":135,"type":"property"},{"id":91,"from_id":137,"to_id":135,"type":"reference"}],"entities":[{"id":127,"label":"cause","start_offset":2476,"end_offset":2488},{"id":128,"label":"effect","start_offset":2498,"end_offset":2522},{"id":129,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":2453,"end_offset":2522},{"id":130,"label":"technology","start_offset":3359,"end_offset":3379},{"id":131,"label":"core reference","start_offset":3460,"end_offset":3542},{"id":132,"label":"cause","start_offset":3460,"end_offset":3542},{"id":133,"label":"effect","start_offset":3557,"end_offset":3584},{"id":134,"label":"emissions","start_offset":3597,"end_offset":3661},{"id":135,"label":"technology","start_offset":3900,"end_offset":3922},{"id":136,"label":"financial information","start_offset":3989,"end_offset":4016},{"id":137,"label":"core reference","start_offset":4020,"end_offset":4178},{"id":931,"label":"technology","start_offset":2041,"end_offset":2062},{"id":932,"label":"core reference","start_offset":2072,"end_offset":2450}]}
{"id":15,"text":"Using green hydrogen, up to 3.5 million tonnes of steel could be produced by the Bremen and Eisenhuttenstadt sites by 2030, with significantly lower CO2 emissions. Depending on the amount of hydrogen available, CO2 savings of more than 5 million tonnes could be possible. The technology conversion requires investments in the range of €1-1.5 billion.  \"With our concept for the transformation of the plants in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, we are accelerating the implementation of carbon-neutral steel production. These projects have the potential to have a significant impact in reducing CO2 emissions, in line with the European Union’s climate commitments. We are now asking for the necessary support and access to funding, to make the implementation of our plans happen \" said Reiner Blaschek, CEO of ArcelorMittal Flachstahl Deutschland.  In Germany, the group already operates Europe’s only DRI-EAF plant in Hamburg, where the switch to using hydrogen instead of natural gas in the iron ore reduction process is being prepared. The objective is to reach industrial commercial maturity of the technology by 2025, initially producing 100,000 tonnes of sponge iron a year.  Background  To implement the projects, ArcelorMittal is planning to gradually adapt production in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt in order to be able to competitively manufacture carbon-neutral, high-quality steel using hydrogen in the iron ore reduction process.  This year, two blast furnaces – one in Bremen and one in Eisenhuttenstadt - will be converted to inject natural gas, reducing the use of coal in the iron ore reduction process and thereby further reducing CO2 emissions.  As a next step, innovative DRI-EAF plants are to be set up at both locations. In Bremen, ArcelorMittal initially plans to use natural gas for the DRI, and later hydrogen from electrolysis; the hydrogen is to be made available as part of the regional North German Clean Hydrogen Coastline network. The sponge iron produced in the Bremen DRI unit will initially supply the steelworks in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, until the regional hydrogen cluster in East Brandenburg can also supply the Eisenhüttenstadt site with sufficient hydrogen. In the transition phase, the additional hydrogen required in Eisenhüttenstadt will be generated from natural gas with the help of a pyrolysis plant that will be built on the steel plant’s premises. To secure the future supply of hydrogen, both sites are to be integrated into the European hydrogen network in the long term via the regional hydrogen networks.  ArcelorMittal has set itself the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 30 percent by 2030 in Europe and producing carbon-neutral steel by 2050. To this end, ArcelorMittal is pioneering two breakthrough carbon-neutral technology routes, Smart Carbon and an innovative DRI-based route.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal plans major investment in German sites, to accelerate CO2 emissions reduction strategy and leverage the hydrogen grid  ","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal is planning to build a large-scale industrial plant for the direct reduction of iron ore (DRI) and electric arc furnace (EAF)-based steelmaking at its site in Bremen, as well as an innovative DRI pilot plant in addition to an electric arc furnace (EAF) in Eisenhüttenstadt, following the announcement of the planned expansion of Germany’s hydrogen infrastructure.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-plans-major-investment-in-german-sites-to-accelerate-co2-emissions-reduction-strategy-and-leverage-the-hydrogen-grid\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":92,"from_id":139,"to_id":138,"type":"property"},{"id":93,"from_id":140,"to_id":138,"type":"property"},{"id":94,"from_id":141,"to_id":138,"type":"property"},{"id":95,"from_id":142,"to_id":138,"type":"property"},{"id":96,"from_id":143,"to_id":138,"type":"property"},{"id":97,"from_id":144,"to_id":145,"type":"causality"}],"entities":[{"id":138,"label":"technology","start_offset":6,"end_offset":20},{"id":139,"label":"location","start_offset":81,"end_offset":108},{"id":140,"label":"timeline","start_offset":115,"end_offset":122},{"id":141,"label":"emissions","start_offset":215,"end_offset":252},{"id":142,"label":"financial information","start_offset":335,"end_offset":349},{"id":143,"label":"status","start_offset":1232,"end_offset":1270},{"id":144,"label":"cause","start_offset":1521,"end_offset":1552},{"id":145,"label":"effect","start_offset":1554,"end_offset":1612},{"id":146,"label":"effect","start_offset":1633,"end_offset":1655}]}
{"id":16,"text":"ArcelorMittal today announces that its Sestao plant in Spain will become the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant.  The development is the result of a memorandum of understanding signed today with the Government of Spain that will see an investment of €1 billion in the construction of a green hydrogen direct reduced iron (DRI) plant at its plant in Gijón, as well as a new hybrid electric arc furnace (EAF).  By 2025, the Sestao plant – which manufactures a range of flat steel products for the automotive and construction sectors, and general industry - will produce 1.6 million tonnes of zero carbon-emissions steel by:    1. Changing the metallic input by increasing the proportion of circular, recycled scrap, and using green hydrogen-produced DRI from Gijón in its two existing EAFs.   2. Powering all steelmaking assets (EAFs, rolling mill, finishing lines) with renewable electricity.   3. Introducing several key emerging technologies that will replace the small, remaining use of fossil fuel in the steelmaking process with carbon-neutral energy inputs, such as sustainable biomass or green hydrogen.    Central to this development will be the construction of a 2.3 million-tonne green hydrogen DRI unit in Gijón. Around 1 million tonnes of DRI will be transported to Sestao to be used a feedstock for its two EAFs.  The national and the Basque government’s support in this project is crucial, firstly from a funding perspective, given the significant cost associated with the transition to carbon-neutral steelmaking. Secondly, because it will enable ArcelorMittal to have access to green hydrogen supplied through a consortium of companies that will cooperate in the construction of the infrastructure required in order to produce hydrogen in the Iberian Peninsula using solar‑powered electrolysis and to transport it directly through a network of pipelines. The initiative involves the construction of multiple large-scale solar farms, with hydrogen produced in situ and with the corresponding impact in terms of employment.  In addition to the investments in the DRI and EAF installations in Gijón, ArcelorMittal will invest €50 million in Sestao. This will fund the introduction of key emerging technologies required to bring the plant to zero carbon-emissions, supporting 1.6 million tonnes of production.  Looking further ahead, the company has also committed to achieving net zero[2] at the Sestao plant as soon as possible.  Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:  “It is widely understood that for the world to achieve net-zero by 2050, faster progress over the next decade is essential. Having announced a net-zero target for 2050, we therefore set ourselves the challenge to identify how we could take an existing steel plant to zero carbon-emissions within the next five years. Our teams have been working incredibly hard to turn this ambition into the plan that we have announced today. This is a hugely significant development and demonstrates the strength of innovation embedded in our people, our unparalleled technology leadership, and what can be achieved through investment in existing steelmaking infrastructure. It means ArcelorMittal will be the first company in the world to be in a position to offer its customers meaningful volumes of zero carbon-emissions steel.  “The ability of the Sestao plant to become the world’s first zero carbon-emissions steel plant would not be possible without the support and partnership of the Spanish government. This is a project that will require the support of many different partners to succeed; the plan hinges on the supply of affordable, mass-scale hydrogen, access to sustainable finance and a supportive legal framework that allows us to be competitive globally. The Spanish government has embraced the opportunity and developed clearly defined plans to transition the country to having the energy infrastructure that the green economy will require. ArcelorMittal plans to switch Sestao to renewable electricity. This, together with the green DRI and hydrogen feeding the burners, will result in the Sestao plant achieving zero carbon-emissions. We are also working to reduce Scope 3 emissions to zero.  “As a large emitter, the steel industry can make a vital contribution to achieving net zero by 2050. This project demonstrates what is achievable.”  [1] On a Scope 1 and 2 basis.  [2] Net zero meaning across Scopes 1, 2 and 3.

{"id":17,"text":"ArcelorMittal has today signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Spanish Government that will see a €1 billion investment in decarbonisation technologies at ArcelorMittal Asturias’ plant in Gijón. The investments will reduce CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal’s Spanish operations by up to 4.8 million tonnes, which represents approximately 50% of emissions, within the next five years[2].  The MoU states the commitment of ArcelorMittal and the Government of Spain to transition towards a decarbonised steel industry. ArcelorMittal will introduce new manufacturing processes that contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions. It will also further intensify its R&D capabilities in Spain to support the new project and innovation requirements. The Government of Spain will promote reforms and investments to support the development and growth of a strong, more competitive and sustainable industrial sector, as well as endeavouring to provide maximum financial support for the project, in line with Spanish legislation and European Union regulations.  Given the significant cost associated with the transition, in terms of both capex and opex, it is ArcelorMittal’s expectation this support will cover at least half of the additional cost to enable its operations to remain competitive as it accelerates its decarbonisation program.  The MoU was signed at an event in ArcelorMittal Asturias’ plant in Gijón, which was attended by ArcelorMittal Executive Chairman, Lakshmi Mittal, CEO Aditya Mittal and the President of Spain, Pedro Sánchez as well as Raül Blanco, the Secretary General for Industry, and Adrián Barbón, President of the Asturias regional government.  At the heart of the plan is a 2.3 million-tonne green hydrogen direct reduced iron (DRI) unit, complemented by a 1.1 million-tonne hybrid electric arc furnace (EAF). This starts the transition of the Gijón plant away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the DRI-EAF production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint. The new DRI - which will be the first of its kind in Spain - and EAF will be in production before the end of 2025.   To maximize the emissions reduction potential, ultimately green hydrogen will be used to reduce the iron ore in the DRI, with the EAF powered by renewable electricity. The support of the national and regional governments in this project is crucial as it will enable ArcelorMittal to have access to green hydrogen supplied through a consortium of companies that will cooperate in the construction of the infrastructure required in order to produce hydrogen in the Iberian Peninsula using solar‑powered electrolysis and to transport it directly through a network of pipelines. The initiative involves the construction of multiple large-scale solar farms, with hydrogen produced in situ and with the corresponding impact in terms of employment.  The Gijón DRI will also feed the company’s Sestao plant, situated approximately 250km from Gijón, where production is already entirely from the electric arc furnace route. This means that by 2025 ArcelorMittal Sestao will produce 1.6 million tonnes of steel and be the world’s first full-scale steel plant to achieve zero carbon-emissions.   Speaking at the signing of the MoU in Gijón, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:   “It is widely understood that for the world to achieve net-zero by 2050, faster progress over the next decade is essential. The MoU we have signed today will play an important role in doing exactly that. The construction of the new green hydrogen DRI plant in Gijón will not only enable us to reduce emissions from our Spanish operations by half but will also result in the world’s first full-scale zero carbon-emissions steel plant in Sestao.  “Clearly, this is a project that will require the support of many different partners to succeed; our plan hinges on the supply of affordable, mass-scale hydrogen, access to sustainable finance and a supportive legal framework that allows us to be competitive globally. The Spanish government has clearly defined plans to transition the country to a decarbonised economy and I have been impressed by the progress made in creating the energy infrastructure that this green economy will require.  “As a large emitter, the steel industry can make a vital contribution to achieving net zero by 2050. This project demonstrates what is achievable.”  Expressing their support for the plan, Spain’s Minister of Industry María Reyes Maroto said:   “The Government of Spain and the ArcelorMittal Group fully agree that the transition towards a decarbonised economy is an essential objective for Spain, and they both recognise the industrial, technological and regulatory challenges that this transition poses for Spanish industry, as well as the opportunities it offers, in terms of innovation and improved competitiveness. The Government of Spain, through the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, will strongly support a new framework of institutional relations between the Government and the ArcelorMittal Group, because the Government of Spain recognises the importance of the steel industry for the development of the Spanish economy, while also recognising that the industry needs a stable and predictable legal framework as the best tool to enable it to be competitive and attain the targets set in terms of energy transition and digitalisation, both at national and at European Union level. In this regard, the Government of Spain is exploring regulatory instruments to support the industry in the transition process, such as the compensation programmes for electricity-intensive industries, tools to promote improved energy efficiency, public financing for digitalisation, instruments to promote industrial investments, training programmes and strategies to promote the use of clean fuels.”  ArcelorMittal Europe has a target to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, and an ambition to be net-zero by 2050. The company is pursuing two pathways to achieve this: Innovative DRI and Smart Carbon.  ArcelorMittal Spain’s operations are already contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions from the company’s steelmaking operations. Earlier this year, ArcelorMittal Asturias completed its project to capture hydrogen-rich coke oven gas and re-inject it into the blast furnace, replacing some of the coke used in the blast furnace. Deploying this innovative technology will result in a reduction in CO2 emissions of 125,000 tonnes a year, equivalent to the emissions generated by the annual consumption of 84,000 Spanish households with individual natural gas-based heating systems. These CO2 savings have already generated XCarb™ green steel certificates, which were launched by the company in March 2021, allowing ArcelorMittal customers to report a reduction in their Scope 3 CO2 emissions.  [1] On a Scope 1 and 2 basis.  [2] Should green hydrogen not be available at affordable rates by the end of 2025, natural gas would be used to power the DRI furnace. This would still result in a very significant reduction in CO2 emissions, of 4 million tonnes, approximately 45%.

{"id":18,"text":"In the project CO2, which would otherwise have been emitted, will be separated and recovered from carbon-rich waste gas from the steelmaking process. An innovative chemical process, developed by SEKISUI CHEMICAL in Japan, then converts the waste CO2 into carbon monoxide rich Synthesis Gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen). The Synthesis Gas is then returned to the steelmaking process as an alternative reduction agent for iron ore, thereby lowering the volume of fossil resources required in the steelmaking process.  Key to this work is SEKISUI CHEMICAL’s innovative technology that converts CO2 to carbon monoxide at high yield. To date, producing carbon monoxide in large volumes from CO2 has been very challenging. SEKISUI CHEMICAL aims to demonstrate the ability to scale up its new technology through this partnership with ArcelorMittal.  The technology will initially be trialled over a three-year period at one of ArcelorMittal’s research and development laboratories located in Asturias, Spain, commencing in the third quarter of 2021. The investment cost of the project is USD1.9 million.  Pinakin Chaubal, Chief Technology Officer at ArcelorMittal, said:  “This is an exciting albeit early stage technology which complements our existing carbon capture and re-use or storage technology (CCUS) initiatives. Successfully decarbonising steelmaking will involve multiple technologies and we expect CCUS technologies to have an important role to play.

{"id":19,"text":"ArcelorMittal (the ‘Company’) has today announced with the Government of Canada its intention for a CAD$1.765 billion investment in decarbonization technologies at ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton. The intended investments will reduce annual CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal’s Hamilton, Ontario operations by approximately 3 million tonnes, which represents approximately 60% of emissions, within the next seven years. This means the Hamilton plant will transition away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) – Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint.  ArcelorMittal will introduce new manufacturing processes that contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions and deliver other positive environmental impacts including the elimination of emissions and flaring from coke making and ironmaking operations.  The investment is contingent on support from the governments of Canada and Ontario. Today the Government of Canada announced it will invest CAD$400 million in the project. The Company is in discussions with the Government of Ontario regarding its support.  The announcement was made at an event in ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton, which was attended by ArcelorMittal CEO Aditya Mittal, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard, Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne and Minister of Labour Filomena Tassi.  At the heart of the plan is a 2 million tonne capacity DRI facility and an EAF facility capable of producing 2.4 million tonnes of high-quality steel through its existing secondary metallurgy and secondary casting facilities. Modification of the existing EAF facility and continuous casters will also be undertaken to align productivity, quality and energy capabilities between all assets in the new footprint.  The new DRI and EAF will be in production before the end of 2028.  This project contributes to the sustainability of well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing and is also expected to support as many as 2,500 jobs during the engineering and construction phases. It will also support ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s customers decarbonization ambitions while further enhancing ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s capability to support the most demanding product segments including automotive exposed, advanced high strength steels, and consumer packing.  This new production route for ArcelorMittal Dofasco will provide a technically advanced manufacturing environment for operations, maintenance, and technology staff to work in, with improved health and safety. New positions, training, and development will be provided for employees moving from existing business units to new assets, with approximately 160,000 training hours required to transition our workforce to the new footprint.  Expressing Canada’s support for the plan, Deputy and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland said:  “Our government has been steadfast in defending and championing our steel workers. Today’s announcement, through the Net Zero Accelerator, is about investing in the low-carbon transformation of Canadian industry, taking serious action in the global fight against climate change, and supporting good middle-class jobs in Hamilton. We will continue to be there to support growth and a strong economic future for our steel workers and the broader Hamilton community.”  François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, said:  “We are supporting our steel workers and companies like ArcelorMittal Dofasco as they seize today’s opportunities in the low-carbon economy and they do their part in the fight against climate change. This investment will ensure that Canada’s largest producer of flat-rolled steel adopts innovative technologies, continues to provide economic opportunities for Canadian workers, and contributes meaningfully toward our climate targets. This investment will create good jobs in communities like Hamilton and clean Canadian-made products for the world for decades to come.”  Filomena Tassi, Minister of Labour, added:  “This $400 million investment by our government in reducing greenhouse gas emissions at ArcelorMittal Dofasco will transform Hamilton. It will position ArcelorMittal Dofasco to become a world leader in the development of advanced steels and make a significant contribution to achieving Canada’s carbon pollution reduction targets. We are proud to work with organizations like ArcelorMittal Dofasco that are committed to building a stronger, more competitive economy by innovating to fight climate change and creating 2,500 new jobs.”  Speaking at the announcement in Hamilton, Aditya Mittal, CEO ArcelorMittal, said:  “The plans we have announced today represent a historic moment for ArcelorMittal in Canada and North America, marking the beginning of a new era of steelmaking in Hamilton, that will result in a 60% drop in CO2 emissions within the next seven years. We are very pleased to be in partnership with the Government of Canada - as partners, we all recognize that it is vital to accelerate our carbon emissions reduction and strengthen our climate action. Indeed progress in the next decade is vital if the world is to reach net zero by 2050.  “This project is part of ArcelorMittal’s new global 25% CO2 2030 emissions reduction target which was announced yesterday in our second climate action report. DRI-EAF technology, such as that being introduced in Dofasco, is at the heart of our new target although we do also continue to develop our smart carbon technology route. Transitioning from the blast furnace route to the DRI-route, offers an immediate significant reduction in emissions in the first phase through natural gas and then in a second phase, which we call innovative DRI, harnessing green hydrogen or other Smart Carbon technologies.  “This is the first significant decarbonization project we have announced outside Europe and again reflects ArcelorMittal’s determination to lead the decarbonization of the steel industry. Across the company our people are highly motivated to demonstrate that steel can reach net zero and will be the core material for a carbon-neutral world. This project in Dofasco is a very significant and important milestone in this journey.”  Highlighting the transformative impact of the announcement, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard said:  “The Government of Canada’s investment accelerates the realization of low carbon steelmaking in Canada. This significant total investment in Hamilton will transform our organization and deliver exceptional benefits to all our stakeholders including our customers, our employees and the community.  “The new steelmaking footprint will improve our capability to support the most demanding product segments with advanced high strength steels, including those used for the emerging electric vehicles in the automotive sector. The new steelmaking stream also sustains well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing in Ontario, with the opportunity for our highly skilled employees to work in the most technically advanced Steelmaking assets in North America. The company’s bayfront property has been re-imagined and we are well on the way to a significant and broad reduction in environmental impacts, contributing to the health and sustainability of our community, the environment and the economy.”  ArcelorMittal has an ambition to be net zero by 2050. Yesterday the Company published its second group Climate Action Report in which it set a new 2030 global carbon emissions intensity reduction target of 25%. It has also increased its European 2030 carbon emissions intensity target to 35%, from 30%. ArcelorMittal estimates the cost of achieving its global 2030 carbon reduction target is c. US$10 billion and believes government funding support of approximately 50% is required to enable the Company to remain competitive regionally and globally through the transition period given the capital investment required and higher operating costs of low-carbon steelmaking technologies. The Company has developed two technology pathways, Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI, both of which it believes will have an important role to play in helping the Company achieve net zero by 2050.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal and the Government of Canada announce investment of CAD$1.765 billion in decarbonisation technologies in Canada","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"New DRI and EAF installations at ArcelorMittal Dofasco in Hamilton, Ontario will reduce carbon emissions by approximately 60%","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-and-the-government-of-canada-announce-investment-of-cad-1-765-billion-in-decarbonization-technologies-in-canada\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":139,"from_id":198,"to_id":203,"type":"property"},{"id":140,"from_id":199,"to_id":203,"type":"property"},{"id":141,"from_id":202,"to_id":203,"type":"property"},{"id":143,"from_id":201,"to_id":203,"type":"property"},{"id":144,"from_id":944,"to_id":203,"type":"property"},{"id":145,"from_id":945,"to_id":203,"type":"property"},{"id":146,"from_id":204,"to_id":205,"type":"causality"},{"id":147,"from_id":204,"to_id":206,"type":"causality"},{"id":148,"from_id":208,"to_id":209,"type":"causality"},{"id":149,"from_id":208,"to_id":210,"type":"causality"},{"id":150,"from_id":212,"to_id":213,"type":"causality"},{"id":153,"from_id":948,"to_id":946,"type":"causality"},{"id":154,"from_id":951,"to_id":952,"type":"causality"}],"entities":[{"id":198,"label":"financial information","start_offset":100,"end_offset":128},{"id":199,"label":"location","start_offset":197,"end_offset":205},{"id":201,"label":"timeline","start_offset":397,"end_offset":424},{"id":202,"label":"status","start_offset":211,"end_offset":231},{"id":203,"label":"technology","start_offset":557,"end_offset":628},{"id":204,"label":"cause","start_offset":3802,"end_offset":3813},{"id":205,"label":"effect","start_offset":3909,"end_offset":3973},{"id":206,"label":"effect","start_offset":3979,"end_offset":4030},{"id":207,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":3797,"end_offset":4030},{"id":208,"label":"cause","start_offset":4037,"end_offset":4048},{"id":209,"label":"effect","start_offset":4060,"end_offset":4069},{"id":210,"label":"effect","start_offset":4103,"end_offset":4131},{"id":211,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":4032,"end_offset":4165},{"id":212,"label":"cause","start_offset":5699,"end_offset":5758},{"id":213,"label":"effect","start_offset":5770,"end_offset":5814},{"id":944,"label":"emissions","start_offset":330,"end_offset":346},{"id":945,"label":"emissions","start_offset":379,"end_offset":395},{"id":946,"label":"effect","start_offset":6679,"end_offset":6819},{"id":948,"label":"cause","start_offset":6651,"end_offset":6662},{"id":949,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":6628,"end_offset":6819},{"id":950,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":5699,"end_offset":5972},{"id":951,"label":"cause","start_offset":4968,"end_offset":5002},{"id":952,"label":"effect","start_offset":5026,"end_offset":5079}]}

{"id":21,"text":"ArcelorMittal announces that it has signed a letter of intent with the Governments of Belgium and Flanders, supporting a €1.1 billion project to build a 2.5 million-tonne direct reduced iron (DRI) plant at its site in Gent, as well as two new electric furnaces.  A DRI plant uses natural gas, and potentially hydrogen, instead of coal to reduce iron ore, resulting in a large reduction in CO2 emissions compared with blast furnace ironmaking. The two electric furnaces will melt the DRI and scrap steel, which will then be transformed in the steel shop into steel slabs and then further processed into finished products.  Once the DRI and electric furnaces are built, there will be a transition period during which production will move gradually from blast furnace A, to the DRI and electric furnaces, after which blast furnace A will be closed as it reaches the end of its life. By 2030, this will result in a reduction of around three million tonnes of CO2 emissions each year.  The support of both the national and the Flanders governments in this project is crucial given the significant cost associated with the transition to carbon-neutral steelmaking.  Approval from the European Commission for the funding support will also be required.  Smart Carbon and DRI synergies   The DRI plant will operate alongside Gent’s blast furnace B, which restarted production in March 2021 following a significant investment of €195 million.  Various decarbonisation initiatives, including the commissioning in 2022 of Gent’s Steelanol\/Carbalyst and Torero projects will see annual CO2 emissions reduction of 0.9 million tonnes by 2030.  The combination of the new DRI plant alongside a sustainable, state-of-the-art blast furnace enables the creation of unique synergies in ArcelorMittal Belgium’s roadmap to climate-neutral steelmaking.  Combined, the various initiatives will enable ArcelorMittal Belgium to reduce its CO2 emissions by 3.9 million tonnes per year by 2030 (on a scope 1 and 2 basis, compared with 2018), which is equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 848,172 cars being driven for a year[1]. As a result, ArcelorMittal Belgium will make a significant contribution to ArcelorMittal Europe’s ambition to reduce CO2e emissions intensity by 35% by 2030 and to become carbon neutral by 2050.  Roadmap to 2050  The hybrid model approach of Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI steelmaking in Gent fits into ArcelorMittal Belgium’s CO2 roadmap which consists of three axes:    * Further improvement of material and energy efficiency as well as increased scrap usage   * The implementation of Smart Carbon technologies:     1. Replacing fossil carbon with circular and waste carbon: 'Fresh' raw materials will increasingly be replaced with waste products, in an environmentally and economically feasible way. The Torero project will pre-treat waste wood from container parks to produce bio-coal suitable for the blast furnace process. ArcelorMittal Belgium also has demonstration projects running with plastic waste that could be injected into the blast furnaces in the form of powder or gas.   2. Reforming waste gas into useful chemical compounds: In 2022, ArcelorMittal Belgium will commission a plant (Steelanol\/Carbalyst) to biologically convert gas from the steelmaking process into bioethanol.   3. Separating CO2 for reuse or storage.     * Hydrogen: replacing carbon as a reductant, with hydrogen (ultimately green hydrogen, when it is available commercially).    Alexander De Croo, Prime Minister of Belgium, said:  “To tackle the climate crisis, we need ambitious action. European countries are leading the way, with clear targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. It is good to see that sectors with a large footprint are also joining the race by investing in innovation that reduces emissions and, in the long term, achieves carbon neutrality. This major investment in new technology by ArcelorMittal is important for the wider Ghent region, for reducing our country's footprint, and shows that decarbonising our economy is a joint effort.”  Jan Jambon, Flemish Minister-President, said:  “We believe that technological breakthroughs are key in delivering on the climate agenda. The ambitious roadmap brought forward by ArcelorMittal for its site in Ghent is in that sense an opportunity.”  Vincent Van Peteghem, Deputy Prime Minister of the Belgian Government and Belgian Minister of Finance, said:  “In order for us to enable climate transition for a better, healthier tomorrow it is crucial for government and industry to come together in this crucial pivoting point in time. ArcelorMittal is proving to be a leading example for this transition in our region. This joint effort is not only securing the presence of ArcelorMittal in our region but is also quintessential in lending the Ghent region healthy & clean air for all.”  Hilde Crevits, Deputy Prime Minister of the Flemish Government and Flemish Minister for Economy, Innovation, Work, Social Economy and Agriculture, said:  “ArcelorMittal has chosen a ground-breaking and innovative technology that will significantly reduce emissions from one of their blast furnaces, resulting in a 4% reduction of emissions in Flanders. This unique project will serve as an example to the rest of Europe on how to realise the goal of climate neutrality. Simultaneously, it ensures the sustainable creation of jobs and strengthens ArcelorMittal's competitiveness, to the benefit of Flanders’ welfare and prosperity.”  Tinne Van der Straeten, Belgian Minster of Energy, said:  “This ambitious project shows that industry is a crucial partner to achieve a climate neutral society by 2050. It will be one of the largest climate investments in Belgium that will anchor ArcelorMittal in the Ghent region, that guarantees employment and that will provide low carbon and ultimately carbon neutral steel. Green steels is needed in the switch to 100% renewable energy. What is good for the climate is good for the economy and for everyone.”  Matthias Diependaele, Flemish Minister of Finance and Budget, Housing and Immovable Heritage, said:  “This investment for ArcelorMittal's infrastructure is a sign of responsible Flemish policy. We are investing in a sustainable future for the country, both in terms of emissions and in securing employment in the port of Ghent.”  Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:  “Today’s announcement is the third major decarbonisation project we have announced in the past two months, demonstrating how we are taking firm steps to decarbonise our operations and crucially, to accelerate progress in the decade ahead. None of these projects would be possible without government backing, so we are very grateful to the governments of Belgium and Flanders for their ongoing support as we transition to net-zero steelmaking. Today’s announcement of our project to build a 2.5 million-tonne DRI plant that will co-exist with and complement the Smart Carbon pathway in which we are already investing in Gent, is an example of the kind of transformational change we want and need to implement in order to accelerate ArcelorMittal’s journey to net-zero steelmaking.”  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO, ArcelorMittal Europe, said:   “ArcelorMittal Europe recently announced a more ambitious target for reducing CO2 emissions, from a 30% to a 35% decrease by 2030. We are able to reduce our environmental impact faster, thanks to projects such as this, which embody the cooperation and innovation that we need in order to succeed. ArcelorMittal Belgium has played a vital role in the European business’ decarbonisation strategy from the outset, and as a result of today’s announcement, we will continue to see it at the forefront as we move closer to net-zero steelmaking.”   Manfred Van Vlierberghe, CEO, ArcelorMittal Belgium, said:  “ArcelorMittal Belgium has a passion for sustainability and circularity. We continue to invest and launch new projects in order to remain at the forefront of energy and climate transition. This €1.1 billion project is a major milestone in our decarbonisation journey. The DRI plant and two electric furnaces will result in a sharp decrease of CO2 emissions while the relined blast furnace will contribute to recycling waste wood and end-of-life plastics. This approach contributes to strengthening our global leadership in terms of CO2 and energy efficiency in the steel sector.”  [1] Calculated using the US EPA greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator - https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/energy\/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal signs letter of intent with the governments of Belgium and Flanders, supporting €1.1 billion investment in decarbonisation technologies at its flagship Gent plant","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"ArcelorMittal Belgium will reduce CO2 emissions by 3.9 million tonnes per year by 2030, by building a 2.5 million-tonne direct reduced iron (DRI) plant and two electric furnaces at its Gent site, to operate alongside its state-of-the-art blast furnace that is ready to take waste wood and plastics as a substitute for fossil carbon.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-signs-letter-of-intent-with-the-governments-of-belgium-and-flanders-supporting-1-1-billion-investment-in-decarbonisation-technologies-at-its-flagship-gent-plant\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":162,"from_id":245,"to_id":246,"type":"causality"},{"id":163,"from_id":244,"to_id":243,"type":"causality"},{"id":164,"from_id":241,"to_id":242,"type":"causality"},{"id":165,"from_id":241,"to_id":959,"type":"causality"},{"id":166,"from_id":230,"to_id":231,"type":"causality"},{"id":168,"from_id":227,"to_id":228,"type":"property"},{"id":169,"from_id":227,"to_id":229,"type":"property"},{"id":170,"from_id":234,"to_id":228,"type":"property"},{"id":171,"from_id":234,"to_id":229,"type":"property"},{"id":172,"from_id":233,"to_id":228,"type":"property"},{"id":173,"from_id":233,"to_id":229,"type":"property"},{"id":174,"from_id":232,"to_id":228,"type":"property"},{"id":175,"from_id":232,"to_id":229,"type":"property"},{"id":176,"from_id":961,"to_id":962,"type":"causality"},{"id":177,"from_id":967,"to_id":963,"type":"property"},{"id":178,"from_id":235,"to_id":963,"type":"property"},{"id":179,"from_id":236,"to_id":963,"type":"property"},{"id":180,"from_id":237,"to_id":963,"type":"property"},{"id":181,"from_id":965,"to_id":964,"type":"property"},{"id":182,"from_id":966,"to_id":964,"type":"property"},{"id":183,"from_id":239,"to_id":240,"type":"property"}],"entities":[{"id":227,"label":"financial information","start_offset":121,"end_offset":141},{"id":228,"label":"technology","start_offset":171,"end_offset":196},{"id":229,"label":"technology","start_offset":243,"end_offset":260},{"id":230,"label":"cause","start_offset":275,"end_offset":291},{"id":231,"label":"effect","start_offset":370,"end_offset":402},{"id":232,"label":"emissions","start_offset":911,"end_offset":978},{"id":233,"label":"timeline","start_offset":880,"end_offset":887},{"id":234,"label":"location","start_offset":218,"end_offset":222},{"id":235,"label":"location","start_offset":1510,"end_offset":1517},{"id":236,"label":"emissions","start_offset":1566,"end_offset":1618},{"id":237,"label":"timeline","start_offset":1619,"end_offset":1626},{"id":239,"label":"timeline","start_offset":3160,"end_offset":3164},{"id":240,"label":"technology","start_offset":3237,"end_offset":3306},{"id":241,"label":"cause","start_offset":5102,"end_offset":5123},{"id":242,"label":"effect","start_offset":5134,"end_offset":5164},{"id":243,"label":"effect","start_offset":7397,"end_offset":7443},{"id":244,"label":"cause","start_offset":7455,"end_offset":7476},{"id":245,"label":"cause","start_offset":8133,"end_offset":8168},{"id":246,"label":"effect","start_offset":8186,"end_offset":8217},{"id":247,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":8129,"end_offset":8217},{"id":957,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":7390,"end_offset":7554},{"id":958,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":5055,"end_offset":5251},{"id":959,"label":"effect","start_offset":5214,"end_offset":5251},{"id":961,"label":"cause","start_offset":889,"end_offset":894},{"id":962,"label":"effect","start_offset":911,"end_offset":978},{"id":963,"label":"technology","start_offset":1517,"end_offset":1556},{"id":964,"label":"technology","start_offset":1845,"end_offset":1864},{"id":965,"label":"emissions","start_offset":1902,"end_offset":1957},{"id":966,"label":"timeline","start_offset":1958,"end_offset":1965},{"id":967,"label":"status","start_offset":1485,"end_offset":1499}]}
{"id":22,"text":"The investment, in which the Quebec government will contribute through an electricity rebate of up to CAD$80 million, will enable the Port-Cartier plant to become one of the world’s largest producers of DRI pellets, the raw material feedstock for ironmaking in a DRI furnace. The project includes the implementation of a flotation system that will enable a significant reduction of silica in the iron ore pellets, facilitating the production of a very high-quality pellet.  The project will deliver a direct annual CO2e reduction of approximately 200,000 tonnes at AMMC’s Port-Cartier pellet plant, equivalent to over 20% of the pellet plant’s total annual CO2e emissions. This reduction in CO2e emissions will be achieved through a reduction in the energy required during the pelletising process.  A DRI plant uses natural gas to reduce iron ore, resulting in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions compared with coal-based blast furnace ironmaking. In Hamburg, Germany, ArcelorMittal is trialing replacing natural gas with hydrogen to make DRI, with its industrial scale pilot project anticipated to be commissioned before the end of 2025. The DRI installations the Company has announced it is developing in Belgium, Canada and Spain are all being constructed to be hydrogen-ready, so as and when green hydrogen is available in sufficient quantities at affordable prices the Company can produce DRI with near zero-carbon emissions.  Approximately 250 jobs are expected to be created during the construction phase of the project in Port-Cartier, which is scheduled to be begin mid-2023 and complete before the end of 2025.  Expressing the Quebec government’s support for the project, Premier François Legault said:  “With this project, the Port-Cartier plant will become one of the world's largest producers of direct reduction pellets. The market is increasingly evolving towards this technology. We are therefore ensuring that ArcelorMittal will continue to create wealth in Quebec for many years. We are positioning our regions at the heart of the green economy of tomorrow. My message to companies looking for a place to reduce their GHG emissions is come and see us. We'll help you carry out your projects promptly. Quebec is the best place in the world to invest in the green economy. To build together a greener, more prosperous and prouder Quebec.’’  Aditya Mittal, ArcelorMittal CEO, said:  “This project has an important role to play in our efforts to reduce our group’s CO2e emissions intensity by 25% by 2030, and our longer-term ambition to reach net zero by 2050. Not only does it deliver a significant reduction in our emissions at AMMC, but it also expands our ability to produce high-quality direct reduced iron pellets, which we will need in significant volumes as we transition to DRI-EAF steelmaking at our steel plants in Canada and Europe.  “I am grateful to Premier Legault and his government for the support it is providing in realising this project. It is the first significant decarbonisation project we have announced for our mining business and fitting that we are able to make this announcement at COP26 as it exemplifies the transformational change we need to deliver this decade as we move towards becoming a carbon-neutral business.”   Mapi Mobwano, CEO, ArcelorMittal Mining Canada, added:  “This investment will see us become one of the biggest direct reduction pellet producers in the world, thereby propelling ArcelorMittal Mining Canada into the forefront of mining and steel decarbonisation. From 2025 onwards we will have the capacity to produce ten million tonnes of very high-quality iron oxide pellets, with low silica content and high iron density, which will be highly strategic in the years ahead. This transformation will enable us to reduce our own current emissions by 200,000 tonnes of CO2e per year – equivalent to removing 57,600 cars from the road each year. Moreover, it will support a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of primary steelmaking. These pellets are the feedstock for DRI-EAF steelmaking, which given its significantly lower carbon footprint is expected to replace a significant amount of blast furnace capacity in the coming decades. It also provides a boost to the local economy and community as 250 jobs will be created for the construction phase which will start in the summer of 2023.”  [1] AMMC’s pellet plant currently produces 10 million tonnes of pellets annually, of which 7 million tonnes are blast furnace pellets and 3 million tonnes are direct reduced iron pellets","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal announces CAD$205 million decarbonisation investment in its flagship Canadian mining operations with support from the Quebec government","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"At an event held at COP26 today, ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) and the government of Quebec announced a CAD$205 million investment by ArcelorMittal Mining Canada (‘AMMC’) in its Port-Cartier pellet plant, enabling this facility to convert its entire [1] 10 million tonne annual pellet production to direct reduced iron (‘DRI’) pellets by the end of 2025.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-announces-cad-205-million-decarbonisation-investment-in-its-flagship-canadian-mining-operations-with-support-from-the-quebec-government\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":184,"from_id":968,"to_id":251,"type":"property"},{"id":185,"from_id":256,"to_id":251,"type":"property"},{"id":186,"from_id":250,"to_id":251,"type":"property"},{"id":187,"from_id":257,"to_id":259,"type":"property"},{"id":188,"from_id":258,"to_id":259,"type":"property"},{"id":189,"from_id":260,"to_id":259,"type":"property"},{"id":190,"from_id":261,"to_id":251,"type":"property"},{"id":191,"from_id":969,"to_id":251,"type":"reference"},{"id":192,"from_id":248,"to_id":249,"type":"causality"},{"id":193,"from_id":252,"to_id":253,"type":"causality"},{"id":194,"from_id":254,"to_id":255,"type":"causality"},{"id":195,"from_id":262,"to_id":263,"type":"causality"}],"entities":[{"id":248,"label":"cause","start_offset":301,"end_offset":337},{"id":249,"label":"effect","start_offset":357,"end_offset":412},{"id":250,"label":"emissions","start_offset":508,"end_offset":561},{"id":251,"label":"technology","start_offset":203,"end_offset":214},{"id":252,"label":"cause","start_offset":733,"end_offset":796},{"id":253,"label":"effect","start_offset":678,"end_offset":705},{"id":254,"label":"cause","start_offset":816,"end_offset":846},{"id":255,"label":"effect","start_offset":863,"end_offset":901},{"id":256,"label":"location","start_offset":134,"end_offset":146},{"id":257,"label":"location","start_offset":956,"end_offset":972},{"id":258,"label":"status","start_offset":991,"end_offset":999},{"id":259,"label":"technology","start_offset":1000,"end_offset":1047},{"id":260,"label":"timeline","start_offset":1131,"end_offset":1142},{"id":261,"label":"timeline","start_offset":1574,"end_offset":1624},{"id":262,"label":"cause","start_offset":3333,"end_offset":3344},{"id":263,"label":"effect","start_offset":3356,"end_offset":3428},{"id":264,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":3328,"end_offset":3531},{"id":968,"label":"financial information","start_offset":74,"end_offset":116},{"id":969,"label":"core reference","start_offset":1520,"end_offset":1547}]}
{"id":23,"text":"ArcelorMittal (‘the Company’) today announces it has made a US$30 million investment in carbon recycling company, LanzaTech through its XCarb™ innovation fund, the fourth investment the Company has made through the fund since its launch in March 2021.  The investment further expands ArcelorMittal’s relationship with LanzaTech, which commenced in 2015 when the Company first announced plans to utilise LanzaTech’s carbon capture and re-use technology at its plant in Ghent, Belgium. The €180 million Carbalyst® plant – ArcelorMittal’s flagship carbon capture and re-use technology project - is currently under construction, with commissioning expected before the end of 2022. Also known as the Steelanol project, funding has been obtained from various sources, including from the European Union's Horizon 2020 program, the European Investment Bank and the Belgian and Flemish governments.  Using LanzaTech’s gas fermentation technology, which captures carbon-rich waste gases from the steelmaking process and converts them into sustainable fuels and chemicals, the plant will reduce ArcelorMittal Ghent’s CO2e emissions by 125,000 tonnes a year. It will also produce 80 million litres of bio-ethanol annually, which can be blended with traditional gasoline and used as a low-carbon alternative fuel for the transport sector.  LanzaTech is also developing technology to convert captured emissions into a range of other chemical building blocks to make useful materials, such as textiles, rubber, and packaging.  Commenting, Pinakin Chaubal, chief technology officer, ArcelorMittal said:  “We have worked with LanzaTech for several years, know their leadership team well and understand the potential of their technology and the role it can play in not only helping us to decarbonise, but also in producing valuable products from our carbon bearing gases which can help the decarbonisation of other sectors. Extending our relationship through this investment was therefore a natural next step and we are very pleased to now have an excellent CCU technology company within our XCarb™ innovation fund portfolio.”   Jennifer Holmgren, CEO, LanzaTech added:  “No longer can we simply extract more resources to make the things we need. ArcelorMittal has long been a champion of the circular economy and through their XCarb™ innovation fund they are helping create a new circular carbon economy. We are delighted to deepen our relationship with ArcelorMittal and look forward to this next chapter as we create a future where everything can be made from recycled carbon.”  Previous investments the Company has made through its XCarb™ innovation fund include: US$10 million in Heliogen, a renewable energy technology company that focuses on ‘unlocking the power of sunlight to replace fossil fuels’; US$25 million in Form Energy, which is developing a breakthrough low-cost iron-air battery storage technology; and a commitment of US$100 million over five years in Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst program, an initiative Bill Gates founded to scale the technologies the world needs to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2021-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal expands partnership with carbon capture and re-use specialist LanzaTech through US$30 million investment","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Investment is ArcelorMittal’s fourth via its XCarb™ innovation fund","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-expands-partnership-with-carbon-capture-and-re-use-specialist-lanzatech-through-us-30-million-investment\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":196,"from_id":265,"to_id":266,"type":"property"},{"id":201,"from_id":271,"to_id":973,"type":"property"},{"id":202,"from_id":269,"to_id":973,"type":"property"},{"id":203,"from_id":272,"to_id":973,"type":"property"},{"id":204,"from_id":268,"to_id":975,"type":"property"},{"id":205,"from_id":973,"to_id":975,"type":"reference"},{"id":206,"from_id":974,"to_id":975,"type":"reference"},{"id":207,"from_id":273,"to_id":974,"type":"property"},{"id":208,"from_id":274,"to_id":976,"type":"property"},{"id":209,"from_id":276,"to_id":277,"type":"property"}],"entities":[{"id":265,"label":"financial information","start_offset":60,"end_offset":84},{"id":266,"label":"technology","start_offset":88,"end_offset":104},{"id":268,"label":"location","start_offset":468,"end_offset":482},{"id":269,"label":"financial information","start_offset":488,"end_offset":500},{"id":271,"label":"status","start_offset":595,"end_offset":623},{"id":272,"label":"timeline","start_offset":630,"end_offset":675},{"id":273,"label":"emissions","start_offset":1124,"end_offset":1145},{"id":274,"label":"financial information","start_offset":2650,"end_offset":2663},{"id":276,"label":"financial information","start_offset":2790,"end_offset":2803},{"id":277,"label":"technology","start_offset":2855,"end_offset":2899},{"id":973,"label":"core reference","start_offset":545,"end_offset":589},{"id":974,"label":"core reference","start_offset":897,"end_offset":936},{"id":975,"label":"technology","start_offset":403,"end_offset":451},{"id":976,"label":"technology","start_offset":2667,"end_offset":2714}]}
{"id":24,"text":"The Prime Minister announced support from the French Government for ArcelorMittal’s decarbonisation programme in France, which involves a €1.7 billion investment in its Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk sites in France. This investment will enable a profound transformation of steelmaking in France and a total reduction of close to 40% or 7.8 million tonnes per year in ArcelorMittal’s CO2 emissions in France by 2030. This transformation will represent a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing industry in France and put France’s steelmaking industry on the path of the Paris Agreement.  The transformation of steelmaking operations will generate positive and sustainable dynamics for employment and industrial activity in France, especially in the Dunkirk and Fos-sur-Mer areas.  ArcelorMittal will implement €1.7 billion of investments by 2030 to accelerate the decarbonisation of its steelmaking sites in Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk while maintaining equivalent production capacities:    * In Fos-sur-Mer, ArcelorMittal will build an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). This new unit will complement the ladle furnace announced last March and supported by France’s recovery plan, ‘France Relance’. Together these investments will turn Fos-sur-Mer into a reference site for the production of low carbon, circular steel, made from recycled steel;   * In Dunkirk, ArcelorMittal will build a 2.5 million tonne Direct Reduction of Iron (DRI) unit to transform iron ore using hydrogen instead of coal. This DRI will be coupled with an innovative technology electric furnace and completed by an additional Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). Other investments are already under way to continue to increase the proportion of scrap steel used.    The new industrial facilities will be operational starting in 2027 and will gradually replace 3 out of 5 of ArcelorMittal’s blast furnaces in France by 2030 (2 out of 3 in Dunkirk, 1 out of 2 in Fos).  Decarbonising the Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk sites will contribute to maintaining and developing the French steelmaking industry. It will also support the strengthening and development of local ecosystems, generating positive and sustainable dynamics for employment and industrial activity in France, especially in the Dunkirk and Fos-sur-Mer areas.  Commenting, Eric Niedziela, Chairman of ArcelorMittal France and Vice President Climate Action ArcelorMittal Europe, said:  “ArcelorMittal is honored that the French State supports our projects. We are proud to have this unique opportunity to contribute to the objectives of the France 2030 plan and to maintaining a strong manufacturing industry in France, serving European markets. ArcelorMittal’s management team and its 15,500 employees in France are mobilised to succeed in this new industrial revolution and we will be happy to welcome new talents willing to participate in this extraordinary adventure.”  Yves Koeberlé, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, added:  “As a leader in steelmaking, ArcelorMittal is committed to decarbonising its plants in Europe to serve our industrial customers – automotive, packaging, construction, transport but also solar and wind energy and future networks for hydrogen and CO2 capture. We are grateful for this support from the French State which will enable the major transformation of our sites in Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk which together account for over one-third of ArcelorMittal’s flat steel production in Europe.”  Matthieu Jehl, CEO of ArcelorMittal France, said:  “This support makes possible the extremely high investments we need to make to decarbonise steelmaking on our Dunkirk site, Europe’s largest steel producing site. We will therefore continue transforming our sites in France to deliver our customers with low carbon steel.”   Bruno Ribo, CEO of ArcelorMittal Méditerranée, said:  “Our Fos-sur-Mer site will undergo a first-of-a-kind transformation to decarbonize. Our teams are already implementing a first investment – our ladle furnace – which will increase our production of low carbon steel. We are ready to continue.”  ArcelorMittal’s French operations have already started working on a second step in their decarbonisation programme, which will use the technologies implemented during the first step, along with carbon capture and storage or utilisation (CCU\/S) technologies, assuming the technology sufficiently matures and regulation ensures it economic viability. This second step will enable ArcelorMittal’s French operations to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.  The partnership between ArcelorMittal and the French government for the projects is subject to EU approval, which is anticipated by the second quarter of this year, as well as the availability of economically viable energy infrastructure and supply.  Decarbonising ArcelorMittal’s operations in France: three ways to carbon neutrality  ArcelorMittal plays its part in the fight against climate change and has set ambitious objectives: a 35% reduction in CO2 emissions in Europe and a -25% reduction globally by 2030; and carbon neutrality by 2050.  To do this, ArcelorMittal will change completely the way it produces steel, by:  ✅ Increasing the recycling of steel: one kilo of steel produced by ArcelorMittal in France will soon contain up to 25% recycled steel  ✅ Developing innovative DRI, to make steel without coal, with hydrogen  ✅ Capturing residual CO2 for storage or usage (CCU\/S).","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2022-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal accelerates its decarbonisation with a €1.7 billion investment programme in France, supported by the French Government","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Visiting the ArcelorMittal site in Dunkirk, France, today, French Prime Minister Jean Castex, Minister of Ecological Transition Barbara Pompili, and Minister of Industry Agnès Pannier-Runacher were welcomed by Eric Niedziela, Chairman of ArcelorMittal France and Vice President Climate Action ArcelorMittal Europe, Matthieu Jehl, CEO of ArcelorMittal France, Bruno Ribo, CEO of ArcelorMittal Méditerranée, and Yves Koeberlé, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/press-releases\/arcelormittal-accelerates-its-decarbonisation-with-a-1-7-billion-investment-programme-in-france-supported-by-the-french-government\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":210,"from_id":288,"to_id":289,"type":"causality"},{"id":211,"from_id":282,"to_id":283,"type":"property"},{"id":212,"from_id":284,"to_id":285,"type":"property"},{"id":214,"from_id":977,"to_id":285,"type":"reference"},{"id":215,"from_id":977,"to_id":283,"type":"reference"},{"id":216,"from_id":286,"to_id":977,"type":"property"},{"id":217,"from_id":278,"to_id":287,"type":"property"},{"id":218,"from_id":279,"to_id":287,"type":"property"},{"id":219,"from_id":280,"to_id":287,"type":"property"},{"id":220,"from_id":281,"to_id":287,"type":"property"}],"entities":[{"id":278,"label":"financial information","start_offset":138,"end_offset":161},{"id":279,"label":"location","start_offset":169,"end_offset":208},{"id":280,"label":"emissions","start_offset":295,"end_offset":357},{"id":281,"label":"timeline","start_offset":401,"end_offset":408},{"id":282,"label":"location","start_offset":1010,"end_offset":1021},{"id":283,"label":"technology","start_offset":1051,"end_offset":1077},{"id":284,"label":"location","start_offset":1361,"end_offset":1368},{"id":285,"label":"technology","start_offset":1415,"end_offset":1450},{"id":286,"label":"timeline","start_offset":1777,"end_offset":1805},{"id":287,"label":"technology","start_offset":84,"end_offset":109},{"id":288,"label":"cause","start_offset":3946,"end_offset":3977},{"id":289,"label":"effect","start_offset":4011,"end_offset":4054},{"id":290,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":3924,"end_offset":4054},{"id":291,"label":"technology","start_offset":4278,"end_offset":4319},{"id":977,"label":"core reference","start_offset":1743,"end_offset":1768}]}
{"id":25,"text":"ArcelorMittal (the ‘Company’) has today confirmed with the Government of Ontario its plan for a c. CAD$1.8 billion investment in decarbonisation technologies at ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton. As announced in July, 2021, the investment will reduce annual CO2 emissions at ArcelorMittal’s Hamilton, Ontario operations by approximately 3 million tonnes, which represents approximately 60% of emissions. This means the Hamilton plant will transition away from the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace steelmaking production route to the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) – Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) production route, which carries a significantly lower carbon footprint.  The project is scheduled to be complete by 2028, although the Company is looking for opportunities to accelerate the project timelines.  The new manufacturing processes contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions and deliver other positive environmental impacts including the elimination of emissions and flaring from coke making and ironmaking operations.  The investment was contingent on support from the governments of Canada and Ontario. In July 2021 the Government of Canada announced it will invest CAD$400 million in the project and today, the Government of Ontario announced it will invest CAD$500 million in the project. This secures project funding and firms up the investment.  Today’s announcement was made at an event in ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s plant in Hamilton, which was attended by ArcelorMittal North America CEO John Brett, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, Minister of Economic Development Job Creation and Trade Vic Fedeli, Minister of Energy Todd Smith and MPP Donna Skelly.  At the heart of the plan is a 2.5 million tonne capacity DRI facility and an EAF facility capable of producing 2.4 million tonnes of high-quality steel through its existing secondary metallurgy and secondary casting facilities. Modification of the existing EAF facility and continuous casters will also be undertaken to align productivity, quality and energy capabilities between all assets in the new footprint.  This project contributes to the sustainability of well-paying skilled positions in advanced manufacturing and is also expected to support as many as 2,500 jobs during the engineering and construction phases. It will also support ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s customers decarbonisation ambitions while further enhancing ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s capability to support the most demanding product segments including automotive exposed, advanced high strength steels, and consumer packing.  This new production route for ArcelorMittal Dofasco will provide a technically advanced manufacturing environment for operations, maintenance, and technology staff to work in, with improved health and safety. New positions, training, and development will be provided for employees moving from existing business units to new assets, with approximately 160,000 training hours required to transition our workforce to the new footprint.  Announcing the investment, Vic Fedeli, Minster of Economic Development Job Creation and Trade said:  “From day one, our government’s plan has been to unleash Ontario’s economic potential by reducing the cost of doing business in Ontario by nearly $7 billion a year. This once-in-a-generation investment to transform the province into a world-leading producer of green steel is a major step forward as we strive for a full economic recovery and transform our auto supply chains to build the car of the future – right here in Ontario.”  Speaking at the announcement in Hamilton, John Brett, ArcelorMittal North America CEO, said:  “Reducing our CO2 emissions intensity worldwide by 25% by 2030 is an ambitious target for a steel and mining company; but we believe it is achievable and that it is our responsibility to invent or innovate the processes and technologies that will enable us to reach that goal. As part of that, we understand that in the coming years, the assets used to make steel will undergo a transformation on a scale not seen for many decades.”  Highlighting the impact of the announcement, ArcelorMittal Dofasco President and CEO Ron Bedard said:  “This is the most significant construction project ever undertaken at Dofasco. And the most important achievement in the project timeline will be that everyone working on site is working safely and returning home to their family unharmed.  “All options for the newest, most advanced technology that achieves maximum carbon reduction for steelmaking, enhanced product capability and quality, and advanced manufacturing employment opportunities were explored. Extensive benchmarking and modelling were also completed in preparing the ultimate plan for the sustainability of the environment, the company, employees, customers, and the community.”  In addition to Canada, the Company has also announced investments in decarbonisation technologies in Belgium, France and Spain. Combined investment for the four projects totals US$5.6 billion, with anticipated carbon emissions reduction totalling 19.5 million tonnes, which is equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 4,240,858 cars being driven for a year[1]. These projects sit at the heart of the Company’s target to reduce its CO2e emissions intensity by 25% by 2030 group-wide, and in Europe by 35% by 2030.

{"id":26,"text":"Mr. Van Poelvoorde explained in detail what ArcelorMittal Europe has already done to decarbonise to date, and what it will take to move to the next, crucial phase:  “Building zero-carbon emissions steel plants across ArcelorMittal Europe means replacing the blast furnaces with DRI plants, and building electric furnaces powered by renewable energy. Replacing the natural gas with green hydrogen in the DRI plants – once green hydrogen is available at scale, and at a competitive price - will bring our CO2 emissions down by 90%. And the remaining CO2 emissions will be captured and either stored or used.  “We have a detailed plan to do this and are ready to roll out this plan; we have the investment support of the Belgian, French, German and Spanish governments, and are preparing as much as possible, while we await funding approval from the European Commission – we submitted applications for funding, on time, last summer but are still waiting for a decision.”  Speaking in his EUROFER capacity, he added that across Europe more than 60 industrial scale projects are about to be launched by steelmakers - potentially reducing the European steel industry’s CO2 emissions by 81.5 million tonnes by 2030: “That matches the annual CO2 emissions per capita of around 13 million Europeans – or more than the populations of Belgium and Luxembourg combined. No other energy-intensive industry has set out such ambition.”  ‘Votes will decide the future of steel in Europe’   Ahead of votes on the ETS revisions in the environment committee of the European Parliament next week, and a plenary vote in early June, Mr Van Poelvoorde said: “The situation is very serious, and urgent. With the revised ETS that’s on the table today, even after the whole European steel sector has cut CO2 emissions by 30% and invested €31bn in capex and €55bn in opex, the European steel sector will be paying €8.4bn a year in CO2 costs in 2030 - at a time when we will still be investing heavily in the transition phase from blast furnace-based steelmaking to DRI-EAF steelmaking.”  Linked to the ETS, he also spoke about the proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism: “We welcome this idea, and indeed we need assurance that imports will be subject to the same CO2 cost as European producers. As it is currently proposed however, the carbon border adjustment will not do this. Instead it will create a situation where European steel will be uncompetitive in the global market. We will simply not have a market for our high cost, low-emissions steel, without a level playing field.”  The industry needs a transition period  Addressing critics of the steel industry who argue that the proposed ETS reforms are needed to accelerate decarbonisation, he explained that the industry needs a transition phase to allow time to transform steelmaking sites: “Replacing blast furnaces with DRI-EAF plants takes years – after the engineering phase, we need two years for the building phase, followed by a period of testing and commissioning. For each of our planned DRI-EAF projects, we will transform an existing industrial site through brownfield investment. We therefore need a transition phase. This will allow us to continue producing via the blast furnace route – making steel in Europe and generating funds that we can reinvest building the new plants that we need for carbon-neutral steelmaking.”  Crucial need for renewable energy at scale  Access to affordable renewable energy at scale is one of the crucial pillars of carbon-neutral steelmaking – and Mr Van Poelvoorde explained why: “By 2030 the European steel industry will need 150 TWh of renewable electricity from the grid, of which half will be needed for the production of hydrogen. This is double the total electricity consumption of Belgium in 2020. Europe must accelerate the creation of a regulatory environment for green hydrogen (storage, transport); push the building of infrastructure and accelerate the permitting.”  The importance of a secure supply chain   He also reminded the audience of the importance of a secure supply chain. “Just last month, Ursula Von Der Leyen said: ‘Every euro we invest in renewables and energy efficiency is a down-payment on our future energy independence’ – and the same could be said of Europe’s steel industry. Every euro invested in carbon-neutral steelmaking in Europe, is a down-payment on a healthy supply chain for Europe’s long-term prosperity. Steel is strategic, it’s part of the critical value chain – there’s no doubt that these value chains will be significantly weakened, if steelmaking moves outside Europe.”  To find out more about ArcelorMittal’s decarbonisation strategy, visit https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/climate-action","company_name":"ArcelorMittal","published_on":"2022-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ArcelorMittal Europe CEO calls on the European Parliament to help save European steelmakers’ decarbonisation projects threatened by uncertainty","emissions_rank":4,"language":"English","article_category":null,"preview_text":"Speaking at the multisectoral business federation FEDIL’s annual reception in Luxembourg, which was attended by Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe and President of EUROFER, spoke on the urgent topic of the decarbonisation of European steelmaking and the many uncertainties that the sector faces.","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/media\/news-articles\/arcelormittal-europe-ceo-calls-on-the-european-parliament-to-help-save-european-steelmakers-decarbonisation-projects-threatened-by-uncertainty\/","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":232,"from_id":300,"to_id":301,"type":"causality"},{"id":233,"from_id":303,"to_id":302,"type":"causality"}],"entities":[{"id":300,"label":"cause","start_offset":1687,"end_offset":1698},{"id":301,"label":"effect","start_offset":1849,"end_offset":1920},{"id":302,"label":"effect","start_offset":4520,"end_offset":4563},{"id":303,"label":"cause","start_offset":4568,"end_offset":4600}]}

Using Usibor® 1500 made with XCarb® recycled and renewably produced substrate, Gestamp has successfully trialed the first parts (such as a car’s tunnel, and seat reinforcements) in press-hardenable steel, which is ultra high-strength and therefore enables car manufacturers to achieve excellent weight reductions across the vehicle. XCarb® recycled and renewably produced is a decarbonized product made with a very high proportion of recycled steel in an EAF and 100% renewable electricity. The steel used by Gestamp has a carbon footprint that is almost 70% lower than the same product made without XCarb® recycled and renewably produced. These are major steps forward in Gestamp’s ESG strategy to decarbonize their supply chain and contribute to the mitigation of climate change, collaborating to make this low-carbon emissions steel project a tangible reality and therefore, more sustainable vehicles.   Speaking about the partnership between ArcelorMittal and Gestamp, Francisco J. Riberas Executive Chairman Gestamp, said: “At Gestamp we always work aligned with the needs of our customers in order to meet their objectives of sustainability. And it is most important for the mobility of the future that we help them to decarbonize their supply chain. True to our own ESG strategy, the R&D teams at Gestamp have verified empirically that these steels meet the customer's specifications for these parts. Based on these tests carried out, the Company has defined an approval process that guarantees our customers that our validation of this steel is carried out in compliance with all the validation requirements that they request.”  Geert Van Poelvoorde, CEO ArcelorMittal Europe said: “Decarbonising our world is the biggest challenge we have ever faced as a society, and as an industry. The scale of the challenge for steelmakers means that partnerships and collaboration are crucial for us to have a chance of succeeding – we achieve more, faster, by working with our customers and other stakeholders. Our work with our valued customer Gestamp to use our XCarb® recycled and renewably produced to manufacture ultra-high strength steel to help carmakers decarbonise their supply chain is a beacon for our industry; just a few years ago, we did not think it would be technically possible to do this, but today we are on the brink of supplying low-carbon emissions steel for large-scale automotive production”.

{"id":31,"text":"IRVING, Texas — Global energy demand will increase 25 percent between 2014 and 2040, driven by population growth and economic expansion, ExxonMobil said today in the 2016 edition of \n  * Global energy demand expected to increase 25 percent between 2014-2040, driven by population and economic growth\n  * Carbon intensity of the global economy to fall by half due to significant energy efficiency gains and a gradual transition to less carbon-intensive energy types \nAt the same time, energy efficiency gains and increased use of renewable energy sources and lower carbon fuels, such as natural gas, are expected to help reduce by half the carbon intensity of the global economy.\nDuring the period, the world’s population will increase by about 2 billion people and emerging economies will continue to expand significantly. Most growth in energy demand will occur in developing nations that are not part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Per capita income in those countries is likely to increase by 135 percent.\nNatural gas is expected to meet about 40 percent of the growth in global energy needs and demand for the fuel will increase by 50 percent. Nuclear and renewable energy sources – including bio-energy, hydro, geothermal, wind, and solar – are also likely to account for nearly 40 percent of the growth in global energy demand by 2040. By then, they are expected to make up nearly 25 percent of supplies of which nuclear alone represents about one third.\n“ExxonMobil’s analysis and those of independent agencies confirms our long-standing view that all viable energy sources will be needed to meet increasing demand,” said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation. “The Outlook for Energy is a useful resource to help understand future energy supply and demand, which can aid decisions by individuals, businesses and governments that together will affect the future of energy.”\nThe Outlook projects that global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will peak around 2030 and then start to decline. Emissions in OECD nations are projected to fall by about 20 percent from 2014 to 2040.\nThe Outlook for Energy is ExxonMobil’s long-range forecast developed by its economists, engineers and scientists through data-driven analysis. It examines energy supply and demand trends for approximately 100 countries, 15 demand sectors and 20 different energy types.\n“Our forecast is used as a foundation for the company’s business strategies and to help guide multi-billion dollar investment decisions,” said William Colton, vice president of ExxonMobil Corporate Strategic Planning, which develops The Outlook for Energy. “For many years the Outlook has taken into account policies established to reduce energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. The climate accord reached at the recent COP 21 conference in Paris set many new goals, and while many related policies are still emerging, the outlook continues to anticipate that such policies will increase the cost of carbon dioxide emissions over time.”\nKey findings of the report include:\n  * In 2040, oil and natural gas are expected to make up nearly 60 percent of global supplies, while nuclear and renewables will be approaching 25 percent. Oil will provide one third of the world’s energy in 2040, remaining the No. 1 source of fuel, and natural gas will move into second place.\n  * North America, which for decades had been an oil importer, is on pace to become a net exporter around 2020.\n  * India will surpass China as the world’s most populous nation, with 1.6 billion people. The two countries are expected to account for almost half of the growth in global energy demand.\n  * Global demand for electricity is expected to increase by 65 percent, and 85 percent of the increase is in non-OECD nations.\n  * The share of the world’s electricity generated by coal is expected to fall to about 30 percent in 2040 from approximately 40 percent in 2014.\n  * Global energy demand from transportation is projected to rise by about 30 percent, and practically all the growth will be in non-OECD countries.\n  * Sales of new hybrids are expected to jump from about 2 percent of new-car sales in 2014 to more than 40 percent by 2040, when one in four cars in the world will be a hybrid. Average fuel economy will rise from 25 to about 45 miles per gallon.\n  * Already the world’s largest oil-importing region, Asia Pacific’s net imports are projected to rise by more than 50 percent by 2040 as domestic production remains steady and demand increases.\nFor more information about The Outlook for Energy, visit www.exxonmobil.com\/energyoutlook.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2016-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil's energy outlook projects energy demand increase and decline in carbon intensity","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas — Global energy demand will increase 25 percent between 2014 and 2040, driven by population growth and economic expansion, ExxonMobil said today in the 2016 edition of \n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2016\/0125_ExxonMobils-energy-outlook-projects-energy-demand-increase-and-decline-in-carbon-intensity","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":250,"from_id":315,"to_id":314,"type":"causality"},{"id":251,"from_id":317,"to_id":316,"type":"causality"},{"id":252,"from_id":319,"to_id":318,"type":"causality"},{"id":253,"from_id":320,"to_id":318,"type":"causality"}],"entities":[{"id":314,"label":"effect","start_offset":16,"end_offset":83},{"id":315,"label":"cause","start_offset":95,"end_offset":135},{"id":316,"label":"effect","start_offset":187,"end_offset":257},{"id":317,"label":"cause","start_offset":269,"end_offset":299},{"id":318,"label":"effect","start_offset":304,"end_offset":358},{"id":319,"label":"cause","start_offset":366,"end_offset":401},{"id":320,"label":"cause","start_offset":408,"end_offset":464}]}

We sought the industry leaders in carbonate fuel-cell technology to test its application in pilot stages to help confirm what our researchers saw in the lab over the last two years.”  \nChip Bottone, president and chief executive officer of FuelCell Energy, Inc., said his company is pleased to bring its global leadership in the development of carbonate fuel cells to this project.\n“Carbon capture with carbonate fuel cells is a potential game-changer for affordably and efficiently concentrating carbon dioxide for large-scale gas and coal-fired power plants,” Bottone said. “Ultra-clean and efficient power generation is a key attribute of fuel cells and the carbon capture configuration has the added benefit of eliminating approximately 70 percent of the smog-producing nitrogen oxide generated by the combustion process of these large-scale power plants.”\nTwo years of comprehensive laboratory tests have demonstrated that the unique integration of two existing technologies – carbonate fuel cells and natural gas-fired power generation – captures carbon dioxide more efficiently than existing scrubber conventional capture technology. The potential breakthrough comes from an increase in electrical output using the fuel cells, which generate power, compared to a nearly equivalent decrease in electricity using conventional technology.\nThe resulting net benefit has the potential to substantially reduce costs associated with carbon capture for natural gas-fired power generation, compared to the expected costs associated with conventional separation technology. A key component of the research will be to validate initial projected savings of up to one-third.\nThe scope of the agreement between ExxonMobil and FuelCell Energy will initially focus for about one to two years on how to further increase efficiency in separating and concentrating carbon dioxide from the exhaust of natural gas-fueled power turbines. Depending on reaching several milestones, the second phase will more comprehensively test the technology for another one to two years in a small-scale pilot project prior to integration at a larger-scale pilot facility.\nExxonMobil is a leader in carbon capture and sequestration and has extensive experience in all of the component technologies of carbon capture and storage, including participation in several carbon dioxide injection projects over the last three decades. In 2015, ExxonMobil captured 6.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide for sequestration – the equivalent of eliminating the annual greenhouse gas emissions of more than 1 million passenger vehicles.\n“We are continually researching technologies that have an ability to reduce carbon dioxide emissions,” Swarup said. “Most solutions that can make an impact of the scale that is required are not found overnight. Our research with FuelCell Energy will be conducted methodically to ensure that all paths toward viability are explored.”\nUsing fuel cells to capture carbon dioxide from power plants results in reduced emissions and increased power generation. In the carbon capture context, power plant exhaust is directed to the fuel cell, replacing air that is normally used in combination with natural gas during the fuel cell power generation process. As the fuel cell generates power, the carbon dioxide becomes more concentrated, allowing it to be more easily and affordably captured from the cell’s exhaust and stored.\nNOTE TO EDITORS:\nVijay Swarup and Chip Bottone will be available to answer questions from media on a conference call today at 10:30 a.m. CDT.

Barry Electric Generating Station, a 2.7 gigawatt mixed-use coal and gas-fired power plant operated by Southern Company (NYSE: SO) subsidiary Alabama Power, will host pilot plant tests of the technology, which uses carbonate fuel cells to concentrate and capture carbon dioxide streams from power plants. The tests will demonstrate carbon capture from natural gas-fired power generation under an agreement between FuelCell Energy and ExxonMobil announced in May, and from coal-fired power generation under a previously announced agreement between FuelCell Energy and the U.S. Dept. of Energy.  \nThis fuel cell carbon capture solution could substantially reduce costs and lead to a more economical pathway toward large-scale carbon capture and sequestration globally.\n“The fuel cell carbon capture solution we are advancing with ExxonMobil could be a game-changer in affordably reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants globally,” said Chip Bottone, president and chief executive officer of FuelCell Energy, Inc. “The carbonate fuel cell solution uses a proven global platform to generate power while capturing carbon dioxide.”\nVijay Swarup, vice president for research and development at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company, said ExxonMobil scientists recognized an opportunity to pursue the novel approach to use carbonate fuel cells at natural gas power plants. Current carbon capture processes consume energy, which increases costs. But carbonate fuel cells generate electricity and hydrogen while capturing and concentrating carbon dioxide streams, which will reduce the cost of carbon capture.\n“The world’s growing need for electricity makes it critical to continue finding affordable, scalable ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants to mitigate the risk of climate change,” said Swarup. “We’re excited about the potential of this novel approach as we continue to work on the scientific fundamentals in the lab and look to prove their viability in the field.”\nThe pilot plant tests will use FuelCell Energy’s commercial DFC3000® carbonate fuel cell power system to concentrate and capture a portion of the carbon dioxide emissions from the power plant as part of the fuel cells’ power generation process. Flue gas from power generation will be directed into the fuel cells’ air intake system where it is combined with natural gas. The fuel cells concentrate and capture carbon dioxide and also eliminate about 70 percent of smog-producing nitrogen oxide from coal, supporting federal and local clean air initiatives. Following capture, carbon dioxide will be compressed and cooled utilizing standard chilling equipment. Installation of the fuel cell plant will begin after completion of engineering studies that are already under way.\nResults from the natural gas pilot test will help guide engineering studies for potential construction of a standalone pilot plant to test the technology at a larger scale, under FuelCell Energy’s existing agreement with ExxonMobil.\nThe Barry generating station is located near Mobile in Bucks, Alabama, and has 2,657 megawatt total generating capacity from six units fueled by coal and natural gas. Southern Company and Alabama Power have previously conducted carbon capture research at the location and at another power plant in Wilsonville, Alabama, near Birmingham.\nExxonMobil is a global leader in carbon capture and sequestration, and captured approximately 6.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2015 for sequestration, the equivalent of eliminating the annual greenhouse gas emissions of more than 1 million passenger vehicles. Since 2000, ExxonMobil has spent nearly $7 billion on technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including on energy efficiency, cogeneration, flare reduction, carbon capture and sequestration, and research on lower-emission energy solutions.\nAccording to 2015 data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, two-thirds of the 4 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity generated in the United States originated from coal and natural gas.\nAbout FuelCell Energy\nDirect FuelCell® power plants are generating ultra-clean, efficient and reliable power on three continents, affordably providing continuous distributed power generation to a variety of industries including utilities, commercial and municipal customers.

{"id":36,"text":"IRVING, Texas--ExxonMobil today released its \nThey are in response to a 2017 shareholder resolution seeking additional climate disclosures about the impacts of technology advances and global climate change policies on the company.\nThe Energy & Carbon Summary and a new special section in the annual Outlook for Energy include consideration of the impact on future energy demand from an analysis of multiple lower-carbon scenarios published by the Stanford University Energy Modeling Forum. The forum’s scenarios are publicly available and are used for analytical purposes, including by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nThe global scenarios assessed by ExxonMobil, which include a full range of energy technologies, contemplate limiting global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to have a likely chance of holding atmospheric concentrations to the equivalent of 450 parts per million CO2 in 2100; these scenarios are generally considered to be consistent with pathways that would limit global average temperature rise in 2100 to 2oC above pre-industrial levels.\nThe company’s analysis of these 2oC scenarios examined the mean of the annual average demand growth rates of the various model outputs between 2010 and 2040 for multiple sources of energy. This analysis of these 2oC scenarios indicates: total energy demand increases about 0.5 percent per year; oil demand decreases about 0.4 percent per year; natural gas demand increases about 0.9 percent per year; coal demand decreases about 2.4 percent per year; and renewables demand increases about 4.5 percent per year.\nAll energy sources remain important across the assessed 2oC scenarios to 2040. As a result of ongoing demand coupled with natural hydrocarbon field decline, trillions of dollars of additional investment in oil and gas production will be required, including to meet a 2oC pathway. Based on the average growth rates of assessed 2oC scenarios, natural gas demand is estimated to increase to 445 billion cubic feet per day by 2040; oil demand is estimated to decline to 78 million barrels per day by 2040.\n“Our job is to supply the energy the world needs in an environmentally responsible way,” said Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). “It’s a dual challenge – we need to meet society’s growing need for energy while addressing the risks of climate change. We are committed to being part of the solution by investing in new technologies that can provide economic solutions on a globally scalable basis. ”\nMany experts agree that advancements will be needed to reach and maintain a 2oC pathway through 2100. ExxonMobil has invested billions of dollars in research and development, including multiple university and business partnerships around the globe, aimed at achieving the technical breakthroughs required.\n“Since 2000, our investments to develop lower-emission energy solutions have totaled about $8 billion,” Woods said. “We are deploying technologies such as cogeneration and carbon capture and storage, while researching next-generation solutions such as algae biofuels and advanced carbon capture using fuel cells. Continued research will be critical.”\nWith growing global populations and economies, key levers to address the risks of climate change include further energy efficiency improvements and reducing the GHG intensity of the world’s energy system. “For our part, we continue to take action to mitigate our emissions and help consumers lessen their GHG impact,” Woods said.\nExxonMobil’s Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040 describes a rapidly growing global population and rise in living standards in developing countries that will drive a growth in worldwide energy demand of about 25 percent from 2016 to 2040. At the same time, energy efficiency gains and gradual reductions in the GHG intensity of the energy system, will help to moderate energy use and reduce by nearly 45 percent the carbon intensity of the global economy, according to the report.\nEmerging economies in countries that are not part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will account for essentially all energy demand growth, led by an expanding Asia-Pacific region.\nAs prosperity rises, electrification continues as a significant global trend. Energy demand for power generation accounts for about 50 percent of global demand growth, with much of that coming from non-OECD countries.\n“Natural gas use is likely to increase more than any other energy source, around 40 percent, with about half its growth for electricity generation,” said T.J. Wojnar, vice president for Corporate Strategic Planning. “The abundance and versatility of natural gas, in addition to its significant air quality benefits, make it a valuable energy source to meet a wide variety of needs, while also helping the world to shift to a less carbon-intensive source of energy.”\nAmong the most rapidly expanding energy supplies will be electricity from solar and wind, together growing about 400 percent.\nWhile energy demand will grow, global carbon dioxide emissions are likely to peak by 2040, at about 10 percent above 2016 levels, as energy sources shift toward lower-emission fuels such as natural gas, renewables, and nuclear.\nThe Outlook predicts a rise in electric vehicles as well as efficiency improvements in conventional engines. This will likely lead to a peak in liquid fuels use by the world’s light-duty vehicle fleet by 2030. However, oil will continue to play a leading role in the world’s energy mix.\n“Our in-depth analysis shows that even if every light-duty vehicle in the world was fully electric by 2040, the demand for liquids could still be similar to levels seen in 2013,” said Wojnar. “This is because of growing demand from commercial transportation and the chemical sector.”\nThe Outlook for Energy is ExxonMobil’s long-range forecast developed through data-driven analysis, reflecting broad knowledge of energy markets and the expertise of economists, engineers, and scientists. It examines energy supply and demand trends for approximately 100 regional\/country areas, 15 demand sectors and 20 different energy types. ExxonMobil uses the forecast as a foundation for its business strategies and to help guide multi-billion dollar investment decisions.\nKey findings from this year’s Outlook:\n  * In 2040, oil and natural gas continue to supply about 55 percent of the world’s energy needs; oil continues to provide the largest share of the energy mix with demand rising about 20 percent driven by commercial transportation and chemicals.\n  * Nuclear and renewable energy sources are likely to account for nearly 40 percent of the growth in global energy demand to 2040.\n  * The share of the world’s electricity generated by coal is expected to fall to less than 30 percent in 2040 from approximately 40 percent in 2016.\n  * Increasing electrification of light-duty vehicles is anticipated to grow strongly. In total, full hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric-only vehicles will be approaching 40 percent of global light-duty vehicle sales in 2040, compared to about 3 percent in 2016.\nFor more information on the Energy & Carbon Summary and Outlook for Energy, visit www.exxonmobil.com\/energyoutlook.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2018-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil releases Energy & Carbon Summary and Outlook for Energy","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas--ExxonMobil today released its \n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2018\/0202_ExxonMobil-releases-Energy-and-Carbon-Summary-and-Outlook-for-Energy","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":280,"from_id":352,"to_id":353,"type":"causality"},{"id":281,"from_id":354,"to_id":355,"type":"causality"},{"id":282,"from_id":357,"to_id":356,"type":"causality"},{"id":283,"from_id":359,"to_id":358,"type":"causality"}],"entities":[{"id":352,"label":"cause","start_offset":1681,"end_offset":1742},{"id":353,"label":"effect","start_offset":1744,"end_offset":1832},{"id":354,"label":"cause","start_offset":3584,"end_offset":3670},{"id":355,"label":"effect","start_offset":3689,"end_offset":3722},{"id":356,"label":"effect","start_offset":5656,"end_offset":5721},{"id":357,"label":"cause","start_offset":5756,"end_offset":5826},{"id":358,"label":"effect","start_offset":6508,"end_offset":6538},{"id":359,"label":"cause","start_offset":6549,"end_offset":6588}]}

The company will continue to focus on investments that take advantage of its technology leadership, integrated businesses and highly skilled employees.\n“Through record discoveries, world-class acquisitions and growing access to attractive markets, we’ve put together the best portfolio of new investments since the Exxon-Mobil merger nearly 20 years ago,” Woods said. “Our investments are robust to a wide range of price environments, and they leverage our competitive advantages in technology, integration and, most importantly, our people.”\nLower-cost-of-supply investments in U.S. tight oil, deepwater and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are key drivers behind ExxonMobil’s plans, and are supported by a suite of industry-leading technologies including advanced seismology, integrated reservoir modeling and data analytics.\nThe company has announced it would increase tight oil production in the U.S. Permian Basin five-fold, and start up 25 projects worldwide, which will add volumes of more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. In 2017, ExxonMobil added 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its resource base in locations including the Permian, Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Brazil.\nExxonMobil is upgrading its product slate through strategic investments at refineries in Baytown and Beaumont in Texas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Rotterdam, Antwerp, Singapore, and Fawley in the U.K. The company expects to grow its chemical manufacturing capacity in North America and Asia Pacific by about 40 percent, in part by adding 13 new facilities including two world-class steam crackers in the United States.\nWoods said the company is focused on four fundamentals: integration, technology, operational excellence and project execution.\n“Our investment plans, like every aspect of our business, are built on the fundamentals,” Woods said. “We focus on success factors that are true regardless of market conditions, and we leverage areas where we have unique competitive strengths.”\nWoods also stressed the company’s commitment to a solutions-oriented approach to address the dual challenge of producing energy the world needs for economic growth while addressing the risks of climate change.\n“Society’s needs evolve and so do we,” Woods said. “We have a long history of consistently rising to and meeting the challenges of a dynamic world.”\nWoods provided details of ExxonMobil’s response to a resolution passed during the 2017 shareholders meeting seeking more information on how the company will address the risks of climate change.\nEarlier this year, the company released its updated Energy & Carbon Summary report, which examined a range of 2 degrees Celsius scenarios developed by experts at a Stanford University forum. Oil and natural gas continue to play a significant role in meeting the world’s energy needs in each scenario and remain important sources, even in models with the lowest level of total energy demand. The analysis also confirmed that more advances in technology will be required.\nWoods highlighted the company’s strengths in innovation and broad research program, and outlined progress ExxonMobil continues to make in researching and developing lower-carbon solutions, particularly in carbon capture and storage technology, next-generation biofuels, and more efficient manufacturing processes.\nThe company is working with Connecticut-based FuelCell Energy, Inc. on a novel approach to capture carbon from natural gas power plants through fuel cell technology, advanced algae biofuels with partner Synthetic Genomics in California, and a more efficient chemical manufacturing technology with the Georgia Institute of Technology that could dramatically minimize process emissions, among numerous other projects and partnerships.\nExxonMobil recently announced initiatives to cut greenhouse gas emissions associated with its operations, specifically a targeted 15 percent reduction in methane emissions associated with production assets and a 25 percent reduction in flaring. Since 2000, ExxonMobil has spent more than $9 billion to develop and deploy higher-efficiency and lower-emission energy solutions across its operations.\nDuring the annual meeting, shareholders re-elected ExxonMobil’s board of directors, supported the company’s executive compensation program, ratified PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent auditors and voted against four proposals by shareholders. The proxy voting results will be made available on the company’s website.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2018-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods highlights growth plans and advances in lower-carbon solutions","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"DALLAS — ExxonMobil plans to more than double earnings potential by 2025 while addressing the risks of climate change through continued research into breakthrough lower-carbon technologies, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods told shareholders during the company’s annual meeting today.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2018\/0530_ExxonMobil-CEO-Darren-Woods-highlights-growth-plans-and-advances-in-lower-carbon-solutions","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[],"entities":[{"id":1009,"label":"technology","start_offset":4503,"end_offset":4576},{"id":1010,"label":"technology","start_offset":4655,"end_offset":4703},{"id":1011,"label":"technology","start_offset":4587,"end_offset":4601}]}

{"id":41,"text":"IRVING, Texas and DANBURY, Connecticut – ExxonMobil and FuelCell Energy, Inc. said today they have signed a new, two-year expanded joint-development agreement to further enhance carbonate fuel cell technology for the purpose of capturing carbon dioxide from industrial facilities.\n  * Agreement to optimize carbonate fuel cell technology for large-scale carbon capture \n  * ExxonMobil exploring opportunities to deploy technology within its operations \nThe agreement, worth up to $60 million, will focus efforts on optimizing the core technology, overall process integration and large-scale deployment of carbon capture solutions. ExxonMobil is exploring options to conduct a pilot test of next-generation fuel cell carbon capture solution at one of its operating sites.\n“ExxonMobil is working to advance carbon capture technologies while reducing costs and enhancing scalability,” said Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development for ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. “This expanded agreement with FuelCell Energy will enable further progress on this unique carbon capture solution that has the potential to achieve meaningful reductions of carbon dioxide emissions from industrial operations.”\nFuelCell Energy’s proprietary technology uses carbonate fuel cells to efficiently capture and concentrate carbon dioxide streams from large industrial sources. Combustion exhaust is directed to the fuel cell, which produces power while capturing and concentrating carbon dioxide for permanent storage.\nThe modular design enables the technology to be deployed at a wide range of locations, which could lead to a more cost-efficient path for large-scale deployment of carbon capture and sequestration. \n“Today’s announcement underscores our leadership position in fuel cell technology,” said Jason Few, president and chief executive officer of FuelCell Energy. “We are excited to continue to work with ExxonMobil to tackle one of the biggest challenges that exists today. We have a great opportunity to scale and commercialize our unique carbon capture solution, one that captures about 90 percent of carbon dioxide from various exhaust streams, while generating additional power, unlike traditional carbon capture technologies which consume significant power.” \n“FuelCell Energy has always been proud of our technology and our role in reshaping the environmental impact of industry and electrical generation. This is another giant step forward towards the large-scale deployment of this much needed technology.”\nExxonMobil and FuelCell Energy began working together in 2016 with a focus on better understanding the fundamental science behind carbonate fuel cells and how to increase efficiency in separating and concentrating carbon dioxide from the exhaust of natural gas-fueled power generation.\nThe new and expanded agreement will prioritize the optimization of the core carbon capture technology for integration into large-scale industrial facilities such as refineries and chemical plants. \nExxonMobil engineers and scientists have researched, developed and applied technologies that could play a role in the widespread deployment of carbon capture and storage for more than 30 years. The company has a working interest in approximately one-fifth of the world’s total carbon capture capacity, and has captured about 7 million tonnes per year of carbon dioxide. ExxonMobil has captured more carbon dioxide than any other company.\n\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2019-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil, FuelCell Energy expand agreement for carbon capture technology","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas and DANBURY, Connecticut – ExxonMobil and FuelCell Energy, Inc. said today they have signed a new, two-year expanded joint-development agreement to further enhance carbonate fuel cell technology for the purpose of capturing carbon dioxide from industrial facilities.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2019\/1106_ExxonMobil-and-FuelCell-Energy-expand-agreement-for-carbon-capture-technology","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":292,"from_id":367,"to_id":366,"type":"property"},{"id":293,"from_id":368,"to_id":366,"type":"property"},{"id":294,"from_id":365,"to_id":366,"type":"property"}],"entities":[{"id":365,"label":"financial information","start_offset":474,"end_offset":491},{"id":366,"label":"technology","start_offset":307,"end_offset":368},{"id":367,"label":"timeline","start_offset":113,"end_offset":121},{"id":368,"label":"status","start_offset":285,"end_offset":295}]}
{"id":42,"text":"IRVING, Texas – Scientists from ExxonMobil, University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have discovered a new material that could capture more than 90 percent of CO\nLaboratory tests indicate the patent-pending materials, known as tetraamine-functionalized metal organic frameworks, capture carbon dioxide emissions up to six times more effectively than conventional amine-based carbon capture technology. Using less energy to capture and remove carbon, the material has the potential to reduce the cost of the technology and eventually support commercial applications.\nBy manipulating the structure of the metal organic framework material, the team of scientists and students demonstrated the ability to condense a surface area the size of a football field, into just one gram of mass – about the same as a paperclip – that acts as a sponge for CO2. Results of the research were published today in the international peer-reviewed journal, Science.\n“This innovative hybrid porous material has so far proven to be more effective, requires less heating and cooling, and captures more CO2 than current materials,” said Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company.\n“Through collaborations with strong academic institutions and national labs like UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, we are developing a portfolio of lower-emissions energy solutions. This provides yet another example of one of the many new materials ExxonMobil is researching to reduce CO2 in the production of energy,” said Swarup.\nExxonMobil’s team, led by senior research associate Simon Weston, along with UC Berkeley’s professor Jeffrey Long and his team of faculty and students have been working collaboratively for eight years to develop this potential carbon capture solution that demonstrates stability in the presence of water vapor, without oxidation, allowing carbon dioxide to be captured from various sources, under a number of conditions.\nAdditional research and development will be needed to progress this technology to a larger scale pilot and ultimately to industrial scale.\nThe research successfully demonstrated that these hybrid porous metal-organic materials are highly selective and could capture more than 90 percent of the CO2 emitted from industrial sources. The materials have much greater capacity for capturing carbon dioxide and can be regenerated for repeated use by using low-temperature steam, requiring less energy for the overall carbon capture process.\n“This exciting advance for carbon capture technology is an outstanding example of how scientists with diverse expertise from universities, national labs, and industry can come together to solve fundamental research challenges,” said Jeffrey Long, professor of chemistry and chemical and biomolecular engineering at University of California, Berkeley and faculty senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “We are grateful to have had such long-term research support from ExxonMobil, without which this discovery would not have been possible. I hope this success will serve to encourage further partnerships between industry and academic research labs.”\nExxonMobil is the world leader in carbon capture, capturing more carbon dioxide than any other company since 1970 and working on a portfolio of carbon capture technologies in collaboration with others. Since 2000, ExxonMobil has invested approximately $10 billion in projects to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions. The company continues to expand collaborative efforts with more than 80 universities, five energy centers and multiple private sector partners around the world to explore next-generation energy technologies.\nThe researchers on the technology as written in Science include Simon Weston and Joseph Falkowski from ExxonMobil; Eugene Kim, Henry Jiang, Alexander Forse, Jeffrey Martell, Phillip Milner from the University of California, Berkeley; and Rebecca Siegelman, Jung-Hoon Lee, Jeffrey Neaton, Jeffrey Reimer, Jeffrey Long from the University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2020-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil collaborates on discovery of new material to enhance carbon capture technology","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas – Scientists from ExxonMobil, University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have discovered a new material that could capture more than 90 percent of CO\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2020\/0724_ExxonMobil-collaborates-on-discovery-of-new-material-to-enhance-carbon-capture-technology","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":298,"from_id":371,"to_id":372,"type":"causality"},{"id":300,"from_id":370,"to_id":369,"type":"property"},{"id":301,"from_id":1022,"to_id":369,"type":"property"}],"entities":[{"id":369,"label":"technology","start_offset":139,"end_offset":151},{"id":370,"label":"emissions","start_offset":181,"end_offset":191},{"id":371,"label":"cause","start_offset":2436,"end_offset":2502},{"id":372,"label":"effect","start_offset":2504,"end_offset":2564},{"id":1022,"label":"status","start_offset":126,"end_offset":137}]}

The new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, will initially focus on carbon capture and storage, one of the critical technologies required to achieve net zero emissions and the climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. \n  * New business to commercialize and deploy technology from extensive, industry-leading R&D portfolio \n  * Initial focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology recognized as critical to achieving Paris Agreement climate goals\n  * Advancing plans for over 20 new CCS opportunities to enable large-scale emission reductions \nExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions is advancing plans for more than 20 new carbon capture and storage opportunities around the world to enable large-scale emission reductions. ExxonMobil plans to invest $3 billion on lower emission energy solutions through 2025. The business will be led by Joe Blommaert, who has more than 30 years of experience in the industry with leadership roles in technology advancement, product marketing, and operations. The board of directors has elected him as a vice president of Exxon Mobil Corporation.  \n  \nCCS is the process of capturing CO2 that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere from industrial activity, and injecting it into deep geologic formations for safe, secure and permanent storage. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency agree that CCS is one of the most important low-carbon technologies required to achieve societal climate goals at the lowest cost. CCS is also one of the only technologies that could enable some industry sectors to decarbonize, including the refining, chemicals, cement and steel sectors.  \n  \nExxonMobil has more than 30 years of experience in CCS technology and was the first company to capture more than 120 million tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to the emissions of more than 25 million cars for one year. The company has an equity share in about one-fifth of global CO2 capture capacity and has captured approximately 40 percent of all the captured anthropogenic CO2 in the world.  \n  \nExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions will also leverage ExxonMobil’s significant experience in the production of hydrogen which, when coupled with CCS, is likely to play a critical role in a lower-carbon energy system. Other technology focus areas in ExxonMobil’s low carbon portfolio will be added in the future as they mature to commercialization.   \n  \n“With our demonstrated leadership in carbon capture and emissions reduction technologies, ExxonMobil is committed to meeting the demand for affordable energy while reducing emissions and managing the risks of climate change,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “We are focused on proprietary projects and commercial partnerships that will have a demonstrably positive impact on our own emissions as well as those from the industrial, power generation and commercial transportation sectors, which together account for 80 percent of global CO2 emissions. We have the expertise that can help bring technologies to market and make a meaningful difference.”  \n  \nThe business will seek to develop partnerships and collaborations on a wide range of technologies, and be responsible for marketing of emission-reduction credits created through the business’s sequestration projects.   \n  \nNew CCS projects and partnerships under evaluation include:\n  * U.S. Gulf Coast – ExxonMobil is assessing multiple CCS projects along the U.S. Gulf Coast that have the potential to collect millions of tonnes of CO2 from industrial sources for storage in onshore and offshore geologic formations. Included in these projects is a CCS hub concept in Southeast Texas. \n  * Wyoming, USA – ExxonMobil has progressed permitting for the expansion of its La Barge CCS facilities, which could enable an additional one million tonnes of CO2 per year to be captured. Existing facilities currently capture approximately 7 million tonnes per year, which is the largest amount of CO2 captured by any industrial facility in the world. \n  * Netherlands – ExxonMobil has executed a joint development agreement to advance its interest in the Port of Rotterdam CO2 Transportation Hub and Offshore Storage project, known as Porthos. The Porthos project aims to collect CO2 emissions from industrial sources and transport them by pipeline to depleted North Sea offshore gas fields. Porthos and its potential customers have applied for EU and national support mechanisms. ExxonMobil also participates in the H-Vision study into large-scale production of low-carbon hydrogen in Rotterdam.\n  * Belgium – ExxonMobil is participating in the multi-stakeholder CCS project at the Port of Antwerp, Europe’s largest integrated energy and chemicals cluster. The project, which would collect CO2 emissions from industrial sources for storage, recently applied for support from the European Union.\n  * Scotland – Through its joint venture in the SEGAL system in Northeast Scotland, ExxonMobil is progressing discussions to support the Acorn project, which will collect CO2 from the St. Fergus gas processing complex for transport and storage in offshore gas reservoirs. \n  * Singapore – ExxonMobil is planning a CCS hub concept to capture, transport and permanently store CO2 generated by industrial activity in the Asia-Pacific region. The project concept is based on a plan to capture CO2 emissions from Singapore manufacturing facilities for storage in the region.\n  * Qatar \\- ExxonMobil is a partner in several existing joint ventures with Qatar Petroleum that operate a CCS project with an annual capacity of 2.1 million tonnes at Ras Laffan. ExxonMobil is evaluating opportunities to add additional capture capacity in the region.\nThe new projects will complement ExxonMobil’s current carbon capture capacity in the United States, Australia and Qatar, which totals about 9 million tonnes per year, the equivalent of planting 150 million trees every year.  \n  \nExxonMobil is collaborating with multiple partners across industry, academia and government to advance carbon capture technologies to reduce costs and enhance scalability. This includes the company’s work with FuelCell Energy to advance carbonate fuel cell technology to more efficiently capture CO2 from industrial facilities, and Global Thermostat, a collaboration to advance efforts to capture CO2 directly from the air.   \n  \nCCS opportunities can become more commercially attractive through government policy, including the United States tax credit 45Q, which ExxonMobil supports, and other supportive policies in the European Union, Canada and Singapore.  \n  \nSince 2000, ExxonMobil has spent more than $10 billion to develop and deploy higher-efficiency and lower-emission energy solutions across its operations.

Looking ahead, we’re working to reduce our emissions and develop solutions, such as carbon capture and low-carbon hydrogen, needed to de-carbonize the highest emitting sectors of the economy – a critical requirement for society to achieve its net zero ambition.”  \n  \nExxonMobil plans capital spending of $16-$19 billion in 2021 and $20-$25 billion per year through 2025 on high-return, cash-accretive projects. Spending plans can be modified to reflect market conditions, as illustrated by successful efforts to preserve the value of investment opportunities while reducing capital spending by more than 30 percent in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. The company also reduced cash operating expenses by 15 percent in 2020 and expects permanent structural savings of $6 billion a year by the end of 2023 versus 2019.   \n  \nFuture spending plans take into account potential market volatility as the economy recovers from the pandemic.   \n  \n“Our investments are expected to generate returns of greater than 30 percent,” said Woods. “And 90 percent of our upstream investments in resource additions, including in Guyana, Brazil and the U.S. Permian Basin, generate a 10 percent return at $35 per barrel or less. Downstream investments improve net cash margin by 30 percent and our Chemical investments grow high-value performance products by 60 percent.”  \n  \nTo grow shareholder value through the transition to a lower carbon economy, ExxonMobil has focused its extensive research and development portfolio on technologies to address hard to de-carbonize sectors of the economy responsible for approximately 80 percent of energy-related emissions -- commercial transportation, power generation and heavy industry.   \n  \nThe company’s newly created business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, was established to commercialize low-emission technologies, and will initially focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS), the process of capturing CO2 that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere from industrial activity, and injecting it into deep geologic formations for safe, secure and permanent storage.   \n  \nExxonMobil is the industry leader in CCS technology and has more than 30 years of experience capturing carbon. The company has an equity share in about one-fifth of global CO2 capture capacity and has captured approximately 40 percent of all the captured anthropogenic CO2 in the world. ExxonMobil also produces about 1.3 million tonnes of hydrogen per year and is developing technology that could significantly lower the cost of both CCS and low-carbon hydrogen.  \n  \nThe International Energy Agency projects that CCS could mitigate up to 15 percent of global emissions by 2040 and the authoritative U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that global de-carbonization efforts could be twice as costly without CCS.   \n  \nUsing estimates and demand projections, including from IPCC Lower 2 degree Celsius scenarios, the market for CCS and other low-emission technologies and products is expected to grow significantly by 2040.  \n  \n“Our development of next-generation technologies and existing businesses positions us well to capitalize on the growing demand for de-carbonization and market opportunities that are increasingly coming together to support lower-carbon energy solutions,” said Woods.   \n  \nExxonMobil met its 2020 emission reduction goals that included 15 percent reduction in methane emissions versus 2016 levels, and a 25 percent reduction in flaring versus 2016 levels.  \n  \nThe company’s 2025 emission reduction plans include a 15 to 20 percent reduction in upstream greenhouse gas intensity versus 2016 levels, supported by a 40 to 50 percent reduction in methane intensity and 35 to 45 percent reduction in flaring intensity.   \n  \nThe plans are expected to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 30 percent for the Upstream business.

I was proud to share the results of your hard work and our plans for the future. I thought I’d provide an overview of the presentation that the management committee made.\nA lot has happened since last year’s Investor Day, which took place as the devastating impact of COVID-19 was just emerging. In the year that’s followed, we faced historic lows in our businesses and a challenging economic environment. We dealt with personal impacts involving families and friends. And, we made some difficult, but necessary, changes to improve the competitiveness of our company. \nDespite these challenges, we: \n  * Achieved our best ever safety and reliability performance;\n  * Maintained an uninterrupted supply of essential energy and products; \n  * Advanced an industry-leading portfolio of advantaged investment opportunities; \n  * Delivered critical efficiencies to significantly lower costs; \n  * Achieved our 2020 emission reduction goals and developed aggressive plans for additional reductions by 2025.\nIn short, we’ve emerged one year later a stronger company - positioned for future success.\nGoing forward, our plans leverage our core competitive advantages to deliver sustained value while helping the world transition to a lower-carbon future. Upgrading our asset portfolio while progressing industry-leading investments will grow earnings and cash flow to sustain and grow the dividend, pay down debt and fund future projects. Our current portfolio of major project investments through 2025 generates returns of greater than 30 percent.\nOf course, fundamental to our success, will be delivering industry leading safety and environmental performance, while continuing our drive for efficiencies and lower costs. To this end, we’ve already achieved $3 billion in structural reductions. Our current plans deliver an additional $3 billion in annual savings by year-end 2023. As we go forward, we will stay focused on how we can deliver further improvements by leveraging the corporation’s scale and integration.\nTurning to the environment, we’ve made significant progress in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and have solid plans for reducing them further. In addition, we have a robust development portfolio of technologies and products that will help us and our customers achieve additional reductions.\nAs we’ve advanced research into more cost-effective technology for carbon capture, the carbon capture and storage (CCS) venture we established in 2018 has made good progress in developing a number of potential projects. With this progress and growing government and market interest, we launched the ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business. Leveraging our project expertise, operating experience, facilities footprint and longstanding leadership in CCS, we believe this new business will help accelerate broad-scale deployment of value accretive CCS investments. It could also advance investments in hydrogen as the technology to lower production cost matures.\nCapitalizing on these emerging technologies and market opportunities could significantly reduce CO2 emissions and help society achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement – which we’ve supported since its inception. It can also help us grow shareholder value.\nAs we work toward a lower-carbon future, we will continue to responsibly meet today’s demand for the energy and products needed to support modern life.\nIn the Upstream, we have a world class portfolio of attractive investments with flexibility to adjust spend as market conditions evolve. Roughly 90 percent of our investments to develop resources generate a 10 percent return at $35 per barrel or less. We’re making outstanding progress in Guyana and the Permian, and see great potential in Brazil. In the Downstream, we are improving net cash margin primarily through conversion projects at advantaged sites and in Chemical, growing high-value performance products by 60 percent. The projects that start up from 2021 to 2025 will provide approximately 40 percent of the corporation’s cash flow in 2025 and, along with structural cost reductions, help to double our earnings.\nI hope that all of you take pride in what we’ve accomplished and the challenges we’ve overcome. I hope too, that you take pride in the role our company is playing in meeting the world’s need for energy and products essential to modern life, while helping protect the environment and advancing toward a lower-carbon future.\nWhile there is much to do and more challenges to overcome, there is no organization more capable or committed. \nThank you for this and all you do.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2021-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Darren Woods shares strategy for long-term growth in lower-carbon future with employees","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"At ExxonMobil's \n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2021\/0311_Darren-Woods-shares-strategy-for-long-term-growth-in-lower-carbon-future-with-employees","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[],"entities":[{"id":1043,"label":"technology","start_offset":2970,"end_offset":2985}]}
{"id":47,"text":"IRVING, Texas \/ STUTTGART, Germany – ExxonMobil and Porsche are testing advanced biofuels and renewable, lower-carbon eFuels, as part of a new agreement to find pathways toward potential future consumer adoption. \n  * Esso Renewable Racing Fuel to be tested in Porsche’s high-performance motorsports engines in the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup 2021\n  * Companies to advance eFuel development with potential for greenhouse gas reduction\n  * eFuels to be produced using hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide \n  * New agreement builds on 25-year relationship of developing and testing high-performance products \nThe first iteration of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel is a blend of primarily advanced biofuels and is specially formulated by ExxonMobil’s in-house team of scientists and engineers. Analysis indicates the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a liquid fuel. The fuel will be tested in race conditions with Porsche’s high-performance motorsports engines during the 2021 Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup race series.   \n  \nPorsche and ExxonMobil’s collaboration will also focus on eFuels, which are synthetic fuels made from hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide. As early as 2022, the companies plan to test the second iteration of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel, which will contain eFuel components. The eFuel is anticipated to achieve a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of up to 85 percent, when blended to current market fuel standards for today’s passenger vehicles.i  \n  \n“The electrification of our vehicles is of highest priority to us,” said Michael Steiner, Member of the Executive Board, Research and Development of Porsche. “eFuels are a good complement to our powertrain strategy. They allow our customers to drive cars with conventional combustion engines as well as plug-in hybrids with significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions. The collaboration with ExxonMobil enables us to test the eFuels under demanding conditions on the racing track. This is a further step towards making eFuels an affordable and lower greenhouse gas emission substitute to conventional fuels.”  \n  \nThe eFuel will be sourced from the Haru Oni pilot plant based in Chile that generates hydrogen, which is then combined with captured carbon dioxide drawn from the atmosphere to produce methanol. ExxonMobil is providing a license and support for the proprietary technology to convert the methanol to gasoline, which will result in a lower-carbon fuel.   \n  \nIn the pilot phase, around 35,000 gallons of eFuels will be produced in 2022. As the fuel’s primary user, Porsche will use the eFuels from Chile among others in the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup starting in the season of 2022.  \n  \n“Over the past quarter century, we have worked together with Porsche to develop high-performance products that support Porsche’s vehicle performance on the racetrack and on the road,” said Andy Madden, vice president of strategy and planning for ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants. “Our continued collaboration on renewable and eFuels is a critical step in assessing the technical capability and commercial viability of fuels that can significantly reduce emissions.”  \n  \nThe first on-track testing of Esso Renewable Racing Fuel is scheduled for March 30, 2021 in Zandvoort, Netherlands, and will continue throughout the 2021 and 2022 Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup race series.   \n  \nThe collaboration with Porsche builds on ExxonMobil’s continuing efforts to develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions, including high-efficiency fuels and lubricants, advanced plastics and other products that can enable cars and trucks to use less fuel. For example, the two companies have collaborated on a line of specially formulated lubricants for the electric vehicles market, Mobil EVTM range.  \n  \nIn January, ExxonMobil announced the creation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, to commercialize its extensive low-carbon technology portfolio and plans to invest $3 billion on lower emission energy solutions through 2025. Last year, ExxonMobil announced plans to distribute renewable diesel within California and potentially other domestic and international markets as soon as 2022.   \n  \nOver the past two decades, ExxonMobil has invested more than $10 billion to research, develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions, resulting in highly efficient operations that have eliminated or avoided approximately 480 million tonnes of CO2 emissions - the equivalent of taking more than 100 million passenger vehicles off the road for a year.ii  \n  \nPorsche is committed to invest $17.9 billion in electromobility and digitalization by 2025. In 2030 the sports car manufacturer will offer more than 80 percent of its vehicles with electric engines. The company seeks carbon neutrality in its products and operations by 2030, investing around $1.2 billion in sustainable mobility.   \n  \n\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2021-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil and Porsche test lower-carbon fuel in race conditions","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas \/ STUTTGART, Germany – ExxonMobil and Porsche are testing advanced biofuels and renewable, lower-carbon eFuels, as part of a new agreement to find pathways toward potential future consumer adoption. \n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2021\/0330_ExxonMobil-and-Porsche-test-lower-carbon-fuel-in-race-conditions","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":320,"from_id":390,"to_id":391,"type":"property"},{"id":321,"from_id":392,"to_id":391,"type":"reference"},{"id":322,"from_id":1044,"to_id":391,"type":"reference"},{"id":323,"from_id":393,"to_id":1044,"type":"property"},{"id":324,"from_id":395,"to_id":397,"type":"property"},{"id":325,"from_id":396,"to_id":397,"type":"property"},{"id":326,"from_id":398,"to_id":397,"type":"property"},{"id":327,"from_id":399,"to_id":400,"type":"property"},{"id":328,"from_id":401,"to_id":400,"type":"property"},{"id":329,"from_id":402,"to_id":400,"type":"property"},{"id":330,"from_id":408,"to_id":1045,"type":"property"},{"id":331,"from_id":406,"to_id":1045,"type":"property"},{"id":332,"from_id":409,"to_id":1045,"type":"property"},{"id":333,"from_id":407,"to_id":1045,"type":"property"},{"id":334,"from_id":403,"to_id":404,"type":"causality"}],"entities":[{"id":390,"label":"status","start_offset":64,"end_offset":72},{"id":391,"label":"technology","start_offset":81,"end_offset":124},{"id":392,"label":"core reference","start_offset":449,"end_offset":500},{"id":393,"label":"emissions","start_offset":1390,"end_offset":1406},{"id":395,"label":"status","start_offset":3945,"end_offset":3951},{"id":396,"label":"financial information","start_offset":3961,"end_offset":3971},{"id":397,"label":"technology","start_offset":3975,"end_offset":4006},{"id":398,"label":"timeline","start_offset":4007,"end_offset":4019},{"id":399,"label":"status","start_offset":4053,"end_offset":4059},{"id":400,"label":"technology","start_offset":4073,"end_offset":4089},{"id":401,"label":"location","start_offset":4097,"end_offset":4108},{"id":402,"label":"timeline","start_offset":4164,"end_offset":4180},{"id":403,"label":"cause","start_offset":4215,"end_offset":4324},{"id":404,"label":"effect","start_offset":4339,"end_offset":4448},{"id":405,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":4188,"end_offset":4540},{"id":406,"label":"financial information","start_offset":4249,"end_offset":4260},{"id":407,"label":"emissions","start_offset":4413,"end_offset":4431},{"id":408,"label":"timeline","start_offset":4188,"end_offset":4213},{"id":409,"label":"status","start_offset":4264,"end_offset":4292},{"id":1044,"label":"core reference","start_offset":1318,"end_offset":1323},{"id":1045,"label":"technology","start_offset":4293,"end_offset":4324}]}
{"id":48,"text":"IRVING, Texas\n“ExxonMobil has laid a solid foundation for success,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our board and management have developed and are executing a strategy which has positioned us for future outperformance relative to peers, including paying a reliable and growing dividend. We are uniquely placed to help society meet its net zero ambitions, while capturing enormous future opportunities and delivering value for shareholders for many decades to come.”\nExxonMobil’s presentation outlines how it is investing in lower-carbon technologies to expand business opportunities over the longer term, while driving structural improvements in existing businesses with a disciplined, value-driven approach.\nThe presentation highlights the new ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business, which is working to commercialize technologies to reduce emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors, such as power generation, commercial transportation and heavy industry. The technologies include carbon capture and storage (CCS), which will be the initial focus of Low Carbon Solutions, as well as hydrogen, and advanced biofuels. Demand for these lower-emission technologies could create multi-trillion dollar markets by 2040. ExxonMobil is the global leader in CCS, and has captured approximately 40 percent of all anthropogenic CO2 ever captured, the equivalent to planting approximately 2 billion trees.\nExxonMobil recently announced a multi-industry CCS concept that has the potential to significantly decarbonize heavy industries located near the Houston ship channel; early projections indicate that, with the appropriate enablers, it could remove approximately 100 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2040. The lower-carbon business opportunities leverage decades of ExxonMobil experience in deploying technology at scale, and competitive advantages demonstrated in its existing businesses. In addition, the company’s 2025 emission-reduction plans are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement and a 2-degree pathway.\nThe company also details how it is investing in one of the most attractive, high-return portfolios in the industry to increase cash flow while maintaining existing production levels needed to responsibly meet society’s continued demand for oil and gas and high-value chemical products. \nExxonMobil’s plans are built to capture opportunities in a wide range of long-term energy-demand scenarios, consistent with those of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the authoritative International Energy Agency, that show a continued use of fossil fuels well into the future. The company’s current plan assumes flat production volumes while still generating excess cash at $50 per barrel Brent.\nNoting significant improvements to its portfolio since 2017, and the fact that the company continues to benefit from long-cycle actions approved by its board, ExxonMobil highlighted that total shareholder return (TSR) has outperformed the peer average over the past six-month, one-year, two-year and three-year periods, and had a 52 percent TSR over the past year. \nThe company also outperformed the peer average on long-term return on capital employed (ROCE) and dividend growth per share over the last five years.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2021-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil presentation details strategy to grow shareholder value, protect dividend and transition to lower-carbon future","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2021\/0427_ExxonMobil-details-strategy-to-grow-shareholder-value-and-transition-to-lower-carbon-future","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":335,"from_id":410,"to_id":411,"type":"causality"},{"id":336,"from_id":413,"to_id":414,"type":"causality"},{"id":337,"from_id":416,"to_id":1046,"type":"property"},{"id":338,"from_id":417,"to_id":1046,"type":"property"},{"id":339,"from_id":418,"to_id":1046,"type":"property"},{"id":340,"from_id":419,"to_id":1046,"type":"property"}],"entities":[{"id":410,"label":"cause","start_offset":538,"end_offset":576},{"id":411,"label":"effect","start_offset":580,"end_offset":630},{"id":412,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":493,"end_offset":630},{"id":413,"label":"cause","start_offset":1145,"end_offset":1189},{"id":414,"label":"effect","start_offset":1203,"end_offset":1240},{"id":415,"label":"carbon investment","start_offset":1145,"end_offset":1240},{"id":416,"label":"status","start_offset":1473,"end_offset":1481},{"id":417,"label":"location","start_offset":1567,"end_offset":1587},{"id":418,"label":"emissions","start_offset":1656,"end_offset":1722},{"id":419,"label":"timeline","start_offset":1723,"end_offset":1730},{"id":1046,"label":"technology","start_offset":1469,"end_offset":1480}]}
{"id":49,"text":"The past few days have been disappointing for everyone at ExxonMobil and for me personally. A current and former member of our government affairs team were secretly recorded making disturbing and inaccurate comments about our positions on a variety of issues, including climate change policy, and our interaction with elected officials.\nTheir comments are entirely inconsistent with our commitment to the environment, transparency and what our employees and management team have worked toward since I became CEO four years ago. I want to make our position clear.\nWe understand the tremendous challenge represented by climate change and have fully supported the Paris Agreement since its inception. Our scientists are working to develop innovative solutions to help reduce emissions, with a focus on the highest emitting and most difficult to decarbonize sectors of the economy: commercial transportation, power generation and heavy industry. \nIt is in these areas where we believe ExxonMobil can best contribute to the challenge of climate change. For example, through our new ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business we are advancing plans for large-scale emission reductions with new carbon capture and storage opportunities around the world. We are also leveraging ExxonMobil’s significant experience in the production of hydrogen which, when coupled with carbon capture and storage, is likely to play a critical role in a lower-carbon energy system. We’re investing $3 billion on lower-emission energy solutions through 2025 on top of $10 billion we’ve spent over the past two decades. As we develop additional value-added opportunities, I expect these investments to grow.\nWe believe a price on carbon emissions is essential to achieving net zero emissions. Carbon pricing would send a clear signal through the market, creating incentives to reduce emissions, fostering investment in R&D to advance solutions and providing consumers with transparency to make the best choices.\nWhile there is some resistance to a carbon tax, we are actively and publicly discussing other options, including lower-carbon fuels and other sector-based approaches that would place a uniform, predictable cost on carbon. Today, through government regulation and incentives, we are paying to reduce carbon throughout the economy. Unfortunately, most of us don’t know what it’s costing. We think it’s vitally important for the cost of reducing carbon to be more transparent to enable comparisons of the various options to help policy makers reduce emissions at the lowest overall cost to society.\nWe are actively working to reduce our own emissions. Overall, we have reduced operated greenhouse gas emissions by 11 percent from 2016 to 2020, and we’ve laid out plans for significant further reductions by 2025. We are also working to find new and better ways to monitor and reduce methane emissions, including collaborations with universities, environmental groups and other industry partners. Through 2020, we reduced methane emissions nearly 34 percent across our U.S. unconventional operations, compared to 2016 when the Paris Agreement was signed.\nWe have great respect for policy makers, elected officials and organizations across the political spectrum who are grappling to effectively address climate change, one of the greatest challenges of our time. ExxonMobil’s position is clear: we want to be part of the solution while responsibly providing affordable energy required to power the economy. We have the experience, capabilities, capacity and commitment to help meet this critical need.\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2021-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Our position on climate policy and carbon pricing","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"The past few days have been disappointing for everyone at ExxonMobil and for me personally.

{"id":50,"text":"\nAir Liquide, Borealis, Esso S.A.F., TotalEnergies and Yara International ASA have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to explore the development of a CO2 infrastructure, including capture and storage, to help decarbonize the industrial basin located in the Normandy region, France. With the objective to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 3 million tons per year by 2030, which is equivalent to the emissions of more than 1 million passenger cars, the first phase will consist in studying the technical and economical feasibility of this project. This partnership, which will seek funding from European, French and Regional schemes, is open to other industrial parties.\nThe ability of industrial players to reduce their CO2 emissions in the medium and long term is a key issue for the sustainability of industrial activities and ecosystems in the area of Axe Seine\/Normandy. The companies involved in the MoU have agreed to collaborate to assess the technical and economical feasibility of implementing an industrial CO2 capture and storage (CCS) chain, from their industrial facilities to ultimate storage in the North Sea.\nFrançois Jackow, executive vice president and a member of the Air Liquide Group’s Executive Committee supervising Europe Industries activities, said: “Air Liquide is pleased to contribute to this project its unique expertise in CO2 capture and liquefaction technologies. Since 2015 Air Liquide has successfully implemented CryocapTM in its plant in Port Jérôme, Normandy, an innovative proprietary CO2 capture and liquefaction technology, which allows to capture up to 90% of CO2 emissions. This wider initiative illustrates how industrial players can mobilize to decarbonize key industrial basins and contribute to the fight against global warming. It is in line with Air Liquide’s Climate Objectives, which target carbon neutrality by 2050.”\nLeo Alders, chief operating officer of Borealis Fertilizer, Technical Nitrogen and Melamine business, said: “Our strong interest in this project is in the first place driven by the significant GHG reduction that can be achieved. It is our responsibility to society to seek for and engage in solutions for climate challenges. At the same time the project is an innovative and collaborative approach across the leading regional industries, creating new value chains.”\nCharles Amyot, CEO of Esso S.A.F. and president of ExxonMobil activities in France, said: “ExxonMobil has more than 30 years of experience in CCS technology and is advancing plans for more than 20 new CCS opportunities around the world. We are pleased to collaborate on a joint study to assess the feasibility of the deployment of CCS in the Axe Seine \/ Normandy area, one of the most important technologies required to achieve society’s climate goals.”\nBernard Pinatel, president of Refining & Chemicals and member of the Executive Committee at TotalEnergies, said: “We are pleased to join forces with some major industrial players of the industrial basin of Normandy to collectively engage into a cooperation to reduce the CO2 emissions from our facilities. This collective effort will be facilitated by TotalEnergies’ actions in developing, with partners, CO2 storages in the North Sea such as the Northern Lights and Aramis' projects. This CCS initiative will contribute to the decarbonization of our Normandy platform and is fully aligned with TotalEnergies’ ambition to get to net zero emissions by 2050.”\nJorge Noval, president, Yara Industrial Solutions, a global division of Yara International ASA, said: “This alliance will support Yara Industrial Solutions’ journey to decarbonize production units and all of our value chains. Carbon Capture and Storage is essential in achieving our mid-term ambition of a 30% reduction in absolute CO2 emissions in 2030 compared to 2018, meaning a reduction of 200,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions, equivalent to 100,000 tonnes Blue Ammonia at Le Havre production plant. We will implement future technologies to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 in line with Yara’s ambition. The decarbonization of our site in France will allow us to continue developing innovative applications for our industrial customers, and the impact on society will be significant. Our chemical industrial applications are all around us, from construction to automotive, in animal nutrition and NOx emission reduction as examples.”\n\nContact Air Liquide  \nCorporate Communications: media@airliquide.com   \nInvestor Relations: IRTeam@airliquide.com\nContact Borealis  \nKaatje Caignie - Head of Communications Borealis Fertilizers, TEN & Melamine Business: Kaatje.Caignie@borealisgroup.com \nContact Esso S.A.F.  \nEsso.france@exxonmobil.com  \nCatherine Brun: catherine.brun@exxonmobil.com  \nOlivier Dumas: olivier.dumas@exxonmobil.com\nContact TotalEnergies   \nMedia Relations: +33 1 47 44 46 99 presse@totalenergies.com   \nInvestor Relations: +44 (0)207 719 7962 ir@totalenergies.com\nContact Yara International ASA  \nFrank De Vogelaere, SVP, Production & HESQ: frank.de.vogelaere@yara.com  \nGilles Raskopf, Director Technology Projects: gilles.raskopf@yara.com\nAbout Air Liquide  \nA world leader in gases, technologies and services for Industry and Health, Air Liquide is present in 78 countries with approximately 64,500 employees and serves more than 3.8 million customers and patients.

Calpine, Chevron, Dow, ExxonMobil, INEOS, Linde, LyondellBasell, Marathon Petroleum, NRG Energy, Phillips 66 and Valero have agreed to begin discussing plans that could lead to capturing and safely storing up to 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 and about 100 million metric tons by 2040.\nThe companies plan to help address industrial CO2 emissions in one of the largest concentrated sources in the United States. Collectively, the 11 companies are considering using CCS technology at facilities that generate electricity and manufacture products that society uses every day, such as plastics, motor fuels and packaging.\nIf CCS technology is fully implemented at the Houston-area facilities these 11 companies operate, nearly 75 million metric tons of CO2 could be captured and stored per year by 2040. There are ongoing discussions with other companies that have industrial operations in the area to add even more CO2 capture capacity. They could announce their support at a later date and add further momentum toward the city of Houston’s ambitions to be carbon neutral by 2050.\n“Houston can achieve our net zero goals by working together, and it’s exciting to see so many companies have already come together to talk about making Houston the world leader in carbon capture and storage,” said Sylvester Turner, Mayor of Houston. “We’re reimagining what it means to be the energy capital of the world, and applying proven technology to reduce emissions is one of the best ways to get started.”\nWide-scale deployment of CCS in the Houston area will require the collective support of industry, communities and government. If appropriate policies and regulations are put in place, CCS could generate tens of thousands of new jobs, protect current jobs and reduce emissions at a lower cost to society than many other widely available technologies. The 11 companies will continue to advocate for policies that enable the long-term commercial viability of new, expanded and existing CCS investments in Texas.\nCCS is the process of capturing CO2 from industrial activity that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and injecting it into deep underground geologic formations for safe, secure and permanent storage. With supportive regulations, CO2 from the Houston industrial area could be safely stored in the U.S. Gulf Coast region in formations thousands of feet below the surface or seabed. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that storage capacity along the U.S. Gulf Coast is enough to hold 500 billion metric tons of CO2 — more than 130 years of the country’s total industrial and power generation emissions, based on 2018 data.\nAlthough renewables will continue to play an important role in a lower-carbon energy future, CCS is one of the few proven technologies that could enable some industry sectors to decarbonize, such as manufacturing and heavy industry. The International Energy Agency projects CCS could mitigate up to 15 percent of global emissions by 2040, and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates global decarbonization efforts could be twice as costly without CCS.\nAbout the Companies:\nAbout Calpine  \nCalpine Corporation is America’s largest generator of electricity from natural gas and geothermal resources, with operations in major competitive wholesale and retail power markets across the U.S. Through wholesale power operations and our retail businesses, Calpine’s diverse team of approximately 2,300 employees serves customers across 22 states, Canada and Mexico.

When expanded further, it will have the potential to store more than 20 million metric tons per year of CO2 by the mid-2030s.\n“The application of carbon capture and storage technology at the Fife Ethylene Plant demonstrates our commitment to reducing CO2 emissions from the industrial sector,” said Joe Blommaert, president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. “With the right government policies in place and industry collaboration, the carbon capture and storage opportunities we are evaluating, such as in Scotland, have the potential to move forward with current technologies for large-scale, game-changing emissions reductions.”\nThe Acorn project recently announced plans to capture and store CO2 from the Grangemouth Refinery, and the addition of Mossmorran facilities will help Scotland reduce emissions in its industrial sector.\n“The Acorn project has the potential to capture and store CO2 emissions from Scotland’s largest industrial center, which is an economic engine for the country,” said Martin Burrell, plant manager of the Fife Ethylene Plant. “This agreement allows us to explore the potential for significant emissions reduction through carbon capture and storage, and ensure Scotland continues to benefit from vital manufacturing facilities such as Fife.”\nThe Fife Ethylene Plant recently completed a $170 million (£140 million) investment program to upgrade key infrastructure and introduce new technologies that will significantly improve operational reliability and performance. A further project is underway to install an enclosed ground flare. On schedule to be operational by the end of 2022, the unit is designed to significantly reduce noise, light and vibration, and it is estimated the investment will reduce the use of the plant’s elevated flare by at least 98 percent.\nThese investments, together with ExxonMobil’s participation in the Acorn project, demonstrate a commitment to reducing emissions and to Fife’s future as a competitive asset.\nExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions is evaluating several other carbon capture and storage projects around the world, including in Rotterdam, Netherlands; Normandy, France; LaBarge, Wyoming; and a world-scale carbon capture and storage hub concept in Houston, Texas.

{"id":58,"text":"At ExxonMobil, we develop and deploy solutions that meet society’s needs. Today, that means taking a leading role in providing the products that enable modern life, reducing carbon emissions and developing needed technologies to advance a lower-carbon emissions future.\n Benefits of increased investment\nOver the next six years, ExxonMobil plans to invest more than $15 billion on lower greenhouse gas emission initiatives. This significant increase in spending will further accelerate efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our operated facilities. To that point, we are on track to meet our 2025 emission-intensity reduction goals by the end of this year – four years earlier than anticipated. As a result of our progress, we’re working on even more aggressive reduction plans that are consistent with our support for the goals of the Paris Agreement, the U.S. and European Union’s Global Methane Pledge, as well as the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan announced last week.   \n  \nA significant share of the spending will be directed toward our Low Carbon Solutions business, which is focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry, commercial transportation and power generation, which together account for more than 80% of the world’s energy-related emissions.   \n  \nWe see tremendous opportunities to use our technology and expertise in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels to support meaningful reductions in global emissions. We expect those opportunities to grow as policy support for low-carbon solutions increases.\n Carbon capture and storage\nKey among those technologies is carbon capture and storage, a proven way to collect CO2 emissions and securely store them deep underground. Carbon capture and storage is critical to reaching net zero by 2050, according to independent experts like the International Energy Agency and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  \n  \nExxonMobil is the world leader in carbon capture, and has captured more human-made CO2 than any other company.   \n  \nIn recent months, we’ve announced several carbon capture and storage “hub” concepts where high-emission industries can share infrastructure, enabling benefits from economies of scale. Expanded use of carbon capture and storage can further improve the emission reductions associated with hydrogen and biofuels.   \n  \nThe interest we’ve received for the hub concepts has been extremely positive.   \n  \nEleven companies, including ExxonMobil, have expressed interest in supporting a large-scale carbon capture and storage hub in the Houston industrial area. We believe that by 2040, it could be possible to annually capture about 100 million metric tons of CO2 from refineries, chemical plants and power generation facilities in the area. That’s equal to the greenhouse gas emissions today from more than 20 million gasoline-powered passenger vehicles.1  \n  \nIn Wyoming, we’re planning to expand carbon capture and storage capacity at our natural gas and helium production site, which has already captured more CO2 than any other facility in the world.   \n  \nIn Europe, ExxonMobil is working with other companies and governments to advance potential carbon capture and storage hubs in Scotland, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.   \n  \nIn Southeast Asia, we recently outlined our vision for a carbon capture and storage hub to serve heavy industry areas around Singapore. We signed an MOU with Pertamina, the state-owned energy company of Indonesia, to evaluate the potential for deploying low-carbon technologies there, and another with PETRONAS, the state-owned energy company of Malaysia, to collaborate and jointly explore potential carbon capture and storage projects in Malaysia. \n Biofuels and hydrogen\nBiofuels will also play an important role in a lower-carbon future, especially in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from commercial transportation. \nOur Canadian affiliate, Imperial Oil, is progressing plans to produce renewable diesel at its Strathcona refinery in Edmonton using a proprietary catalyst technology that enables advantaged production. Renewable diesel is a drop-in fuel for use in today’s engines that generates 70% fewer carbon emissions than conventional diesel.   \n  \nHere in the U.S., we expanded our agreement with Global Clean Energy to purchase up to 5 million barrels per year of renewable diesel from its biorefinery in Bakersfield, California starting next year.   \n  \nExxonMobil also produces about 1.3 million metric tons of hydrogen annually, and is working to develop new technologies that significantly lower production costs.  \n  \nAnd finally, we continue to advance research with university partners and other stakeholders to explore and commercialize new biofuel technologies.\n Supportive policy\nGovernments’ assistance is critical in developing durable, predictable, and market-driven policies in order to help drive the greatest greenhouse gas emissions reductions at the lowest cost to society. For example, initial policy support for carbon capture and storage could facilitate the development of an effective marketplace that reduces costs and incentivizes additional investment.   \n  \nTo deploy the technology at the pace and scale required to support society’s ambition of a net-zero future, government policies will need to provide direct investment and incentives similar to those available to other lower-carbon technologies. We have long supported an explicit price on carbon to establish market incentives and provide the needed clarity and stability required for investments.   \n  \nNo single technology can enable society to achieve its lower-carbon ambitions. Predictable, stable, cost-effective policies are necessary to incentivize the development and scalability of a wide range of lower-carbon technologies across the economy. \n1 per EPA GHG calculator\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2021-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Why we're investing $15 billion in a lower-carbon future","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"At ExxonMobil, we develop and deploy solutions that meet society’s needs.

{"id":59,"text":"HOUSTON, Texas – Three additional companies have announced their support for exploring the implementation of large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology in and around the Houston industrial area. Air Liquide, BASF and Shell are joining Calpine, Chevron, Dow, ExxonMobil, INEOS, Linde, LyondellBasell, Marathon Petroleum, NRG Energy, Phillips 66 and Valero to collectively evaluate and advance emissions reduction efforts in and around the Houston industrial area. Today’s announcement increases the momentum for CCS and aligns with efforts to reduce emissions around the world. \n  * Air Liquide, BASF and Shell the latest to join group of companies committed to advancing large-scale carbon capture and storage in Houston\n  * Collective efforts could capture and store approximately 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 – and 100 million by 2040, significantly reducing CO2 emissions from one of the United States’ largest industrial areas\n  * Companies continue to show support for carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions and help Houston achieve its Climate Action Plan goals\nThe 14 companies are evaluating how to use safe, proven CCS technology at Houston-area facilities that provide energy and products for modern life, including power generation and advanced manufacturing for plastics, motor fuels and packaging. In December 2021, the companies held a series of workshops at the University of Houston to discuss collaboration and activation of this important, large-scale emissions-reduction effort.\nTogether, these companies and others in the region could capture and safely store up to 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 and about 100 million metric tons per year by 2040, helping to significantly reduce emissions in the Houston region.\nThese efforts have already gained broad support in the Houston region, including from Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, the Harris County Commissioners’ Court, the Greater Houston Partnership and the Center for Houston’s Future.\n“Large-scale carbon capture and storage in the Houston region will be a cornerstone for the world’s energy transition, and these companies’ efforts are crucial toward advancing CCS development to achieve broad scale commercial impact,” said Charles McConnell, director of University of Houston’s Center for Carbon Management in Energy and former assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Energy. “As the energy capital of the world, Houston has the expertise and leadership—including industry, academia and policymakers—to realize a low carbon, reliable and affordable energy future. I look forward to working alongside these 14 companies to make Houston the global leader in CCS.”\nWide-scale, affordable deployment of CCS in the Houston area will require the support of industry, communities and government. If appropriate policies and regulations are put in place, CCS could help the United States and Houston reach net-zero goals while generating new jobs and protecting existing jobs that are important to Houston’s economy. CCS could also promote long-term economic growth in Southeast Texas and beyond.\nCCS is the process of capturing CO2 from industrial activities that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and injecting it into deep underground geologic formations for secure and permanent storage. CO2 from the Houston industrial area could be stored in nearby on- and offshore storage sites. An analysis of U.S Department of Energy estimates shows the storage capacity along the U.S. Gulf Coast is large enough to store about 500 billion metric tons of CO2, which is equivalent to more than 130 years of industrial and power generation emissions in the United States, based on 2018 data.\nCCS is one of the few proven technologies that could enable some industry sectors that are difficult to decarbonize, such as manufacturing and heavy industry, to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The International Energy Agency projects that CCS could mitigate up to 15% of global emissions by 2040, and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates global decarbonization efforts could be twice as costly without the technology.\nDiscussions continue with other companies that have industrial operations in the Houston region, potentially increasing the projected total CO2 that can be captured and safely stored.\n About the Companies: \nAbout Air Liquide\nA world leader in gases, technologies and services for Industry and Health, Air Liquide is present in 78 countries with approximately 64,500 employees and serves more than 3.8 million customers and patients.

Pending regulatory approvals, startup is estimated in 2025.\nThe expansion is part of the company’s 2030 emission-reduction plans and supports the company’s ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) for its operated assets by 2050. By capturing an additional 1.2 million metric tons of CO2 each year, ExxonMobil can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its upstream operated emissions by 3%. The LaBarge facility currently captures nearly 20% of all human-made CO2 captured in the world each year.\n“Our state has always been a leader in carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS) and we are pleased to see projects like this that bring that technology forward. Wyoming and our industries do more than talk about carbon capture technologies. We help develop and deploy them,” said Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon. “This announcement is a great example of what industry can do to reduce greenhouse emissions and develop resources. I am delighted that ExxonMobil has decided to move forward with their expansion in Wyoming. This helps Wyoming advance its commitment to develop the technology to become carbon negative.”\nIn addition to producing natural gas, ExxonMobil’s LaBarge facility is one of the world’s largest sources of helium, producing approximately 20% of global supply. Helium is an essential component for health care equipment such as magnetic resonance imaging, high-tech products including fiber optics and semiconductors, and materials for space travel.\nExxonMobil established its Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize low-emission technologies. It is initially focusing on carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels – technologies where the company can leverage its core competencies and competitive advantages. Over the next six years, the company plans to invest more than $15 billion on lower-emission initiatives.\nSound government policies will accelerate the deployment of key technologies at the pace and scale required to support a societal net-zero future.\nExxonMobil has more than 30 years of experience capturing CO2 and has cumulatively captured more anthropogenic CO2 than any other company. It has an equity share of about one-fifth of the world’s carbon capture and storage capacity at about 9 million metric tons per year.\nExxonMobil is committed to helping society reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the company’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and developing and deploying emission-reducing technologies and products.

The carbon capture infrastructure for this project would have the capacity to transport and store up to 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year, more than doubling ExxonMobil’s current capacity. \nUsing hydrogen as a fuel at the Baytown olefins plant could reduce the integrated complex’s Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions by up to 30%, supporting ExxonMobil’s ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions from its operated assets by 2050. It also would enable the site to manufacture lower-emissions products for its customers. Access to surplus hydrogen and CO2 storage capacity would be made available to nearby industry.\nThe project would form ExxonMobil’s initial contribution to a broad, cross-industry effort to establish a Houston carbon capture and storage hub with an initial target of about 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030, and 100 million metric tons by 2040. Evaluation and planning for the Baytown project are ongoing and, subject to stakeholder support, regulatory permitting and market conditions, a final investment decision is expected in two to three years.\nExxonMobil has extensive experience with hydrogen and already produces about 1.5 billion cubic feet per day. The company is uniquely positioned to participate in the growing hydrogen market and is evaluating strategic investments to increase the use of this important lower-emissions energy technology.\nEqually important is the company’s more than 30 years of experience capturing and permanently storing CO2. ExxonMobil has cumulatively captured more human-made CO2 than any other company and has an equity share of about one-fifth of the world’s carbon capture and storage capacity, which amounts to about 9 million metric tons per year.\nExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business was established to commercialize low-emission technologies and is focusing on carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels – technologies where the company can leverage its core competencies and competitive advantages. Over the next six years, the company plans to invest more than $15 billion on lower-emission initiatives and could increase investments with advancements in policy and technology.\nSound government policies will accelerate the deployment of key technologies at the pace and scale required to support a societal net-zero future. Predictable, stable, cost-effective policies are necessary to incentivize the development and scalability of a wide range of low-emission technologies, including hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. ExxonMobil continues to support an explicit price on carbon to establish consistent incentives and encourage investments.\nExxonMobil is committed to helping society reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the company’s emissions intensity and developing and deploying emission-reducing technologies and products. Increasing the supply of products with lower life cycle greenhouse gas emissions enables the transition from higher-emissions alternatives.\n\n","company_name":"ExxonMobil","published_on":"2022-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"ExxonMobil planning hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage at Baytown complex","emissions_rank":18,"language":"English","article_category":"All","preview_text":"IRVING, Texas – ExxonMobil said today it is planning a hydrogen production plant and one of the world’s largest carbon capture and storage projects at its integrated refining and petrochemical site at Baytown, Texas, supporting efforts to reduce emissions from company operations and local industry.\n","article_url":"https:\/\/corporate.exxonmobil.com\/News\/Newsroom\/News-releases\/2022\/0301_ExxonMobil-planning-hydrogen-production-carbon-capture-and-storage-at-Baytown-complex","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[{"id":402,"from_id":494,"to_id":1062,"type":"property"},{"id":403,"from_id":493,"to_id":1062,"type":"property"},{"id":404,"from_id":497,"to_id":1062,"type":"property"},{"id":405,"from_id":1064,"to_id":1062,"type":"reference"},{"id":406,"from_id":498,"to_id":1064,"type":"property"},{"id":407,"from_id":501,"to_id":504,"type":"property"},{"id":408,"from_id":502,"to_id":504,"type":"property"},{"id":409,"from_id":503,"to_id":504,"type":"property"}],"entities":[{"id":493,"label":"location","start_offset":201,"end_offset":215},{"id":494,"label":"status","start_offset":44,"end_offset":53},{"id":497,"label":"emissions","start_offset":339,"end_offset":384},{"id":498,"label":"emissions","start_offset":1285,"end_offset":1329},{"id":499,"label":"cause","start_offset":1382,"end_offset":1435},{"id":500,"label":"effect","start_offset":1442,"end_offset":1514},{"id":501,"label":"timeline","start_offset":3185,"end_offset":3208},{"id":502,"label":"status","start_offset":3222,"end_offset":3237},{"id":503,"label":"financial information","start_offset":3248,"end_offset":3259},{"id":504,"label":"technology","start_offset":3263,"end_offset":3289},{"id":1062,"label":"technology","start_offset":55,"end_offset":147},{"id":1064,"label":"core reference","start_offset":1191,"end_offset":1237}]}

{"id":68,"text":"## German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) funds the project, named „CO2MIN“, with three million euros.  During the three-year research project „CO2MIN“, HeidelbergCement and RWTH Aachen University (RWTH Aachen) will explore the absorption of CO2 from flue gas by the minerals olivine and basalt. In the future, the carbonised minerals could be used as a value-added additive in the production of building materials. HeidelbergCement and RWTH are supported by the Potsdam Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) and the Dutch start-up Green Minerals. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is funding the project, which began on 1 June 2017, with a sum of three million euros.  The natural minerals olivine and basalt are able to bind CO2 over their entire life-cycle. With natural absorption, it takes decades until the minerals are saturated with the greenhouse gas. The research project intends to speed up the absorption process. If successful, carbonised minerals can be used for various product applications.  The use of CO2 as a raw material has high priority in the climate strategy of HeidelbergCement. \"We are already reducing the CO2 emissions of our plants very successfully by using alternative fuels and raw materials and by optimising the efficiency of our kilns,\" explains Jan Theulen, Director of Alternative Resources at HeidelbergCement. \"In order to reduce CO2 emissions even further in the future, we have to develop and test new approaches. One of them is the binding of CO2 by minerals.\"  In the first year the research focuses on the investigation of different minerals in small-scale experiments. The carbonation of the most suitable minerals will be tested under realistic process conditions in the following year. The experiments will be conducted by the institute of Process Metallurgy and Metal Recycling (IME), which also is the coordinator of the RWTH group. Life-cycle assessments (RWTH) as well as analyses of economic aspects and social acceptance (IASS) complete this project phase.

{"id":69,"text":"HeidelbergCement and EMBL have signed an agreement on a three-year collaboration to exchange scientific and technical knowledge.  A new Memorandum of Understanding co-signed by EMBL and HeidelbergCement aims to encourage beneficial knowledge exchange in areas related to CO2 emission reduction, avoidance and recovery, as well as driving innovation.  “We are delighted to be partnering with EMBL, one of the world’s leading research institutions for molecular biology, to jointly explore innovative approaches to fight climate change,” explains Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement AG. “This will further strengthen our competence and our commitment to reduce the environmental footprint of our business.”  HeidelbergCement and EMBL will focus their collaborative activities on the coordination of conferences and workshops, bringing international experts to EMBL’s Advanced Training Centre to learn about and debate these important research areas. Meetings will also be initiated that bring together experts from both organisations to develop ideas, action plans and sustainable business practices. During the three-year period, HeidelbergCement and EMBL will also explore further areas for mutually beneficial collaborations.  “Climate change is an incredibly pressing issue” says EMBL Director, Prof. Matthias W. Hentze.. “The science underpinning it is complex and we need the best scientists worldwide to put their heads together to look for innovative solutions. Building on our strong network of internationally leading scientists, EMBL will help facilitate this collaboration and promote discussion between experts.”,  HeidelbergCement’s activities include the production and distribution of cement and aggregates, the two essential raw materials for concrete. With respect to volumes, concrete is the second most produced substance by mankind after drinking water. This is why almost 6% of all global CO2 emissions are coming from cement production. In order to reduce this environmental footprint, HeidelbergCement has already pledged to lower specific CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030 in comparison to 1990 levels.   About EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory)  EMBL is Europe’s flagship laboratory for the life sciences. It is an intergovernmental organisation established in 1974 and supported by over 20 member states. EMBL performs fundamental research in molecular biology, studying the story of life.

{"id":70,"text":"Following a thorough validation procedure, HeidelbergCement’s CO2 reduction targets 2030 have been successfully assessed against the Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi) criteria. This makes HeidelbergCement the first company in the cement sector, and one of currently only about 200 companies worldwide, to have approved science-based targets.  The SBTi independently assesses and validates corporate emissions reduction targets against the latest climate science: Targets adopted by companies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are considered “science-based” if they are in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement – to limit global warming to well-below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.  HeidelbergCement’s CO2 reduction strategy is based on concrete bottom-up measures on plant and product level. These include improving energy efficiency, and a steadily increasing use of alternative fuels and alternative raw materials. \"Concrete has the potential to become the most sustainable building material,\" says Dr. Bernd Scheifele, Chairman of the Managing Board of HeidelbergCement. \"Our goal is to realise the vision of CO2-neutral concrete by 2050 at the latest. In the coming years, we want to make significant progress in this direction, and the SBTi’s approval is a clear proof of our strong commitment.\"  HeidelbergCement’s SBTi-approved target is to reduce scope 1 GHG emissions 15% per ton of cementitious materials by 2030 from a 2016 base year. HeidelbergCement also commits to reduce scope 2 GHG emissions 65% per ton of cementitious materials within the same timeframe1). The SBTi-approved target is consistent with HeidelbergCement’s previously formulated goal of a 30% reduction in its specific net CO2 emissions by 2030, compared with 1990. To date, HeidelbergCement has already managed to achieve a reduction of 20% and is in a leading position when it comes to the development of new technologies for CO2 sequestration and use, e.g. by returning the CO2 into the material cycle of cement and concrete through recarbonation.   1) The target boundary includes biogenic emissions and removals associated with the use of bioenergy.  2,100 characters","company_name":"HeidelbergCement Group (Cement\/Lime)","published_on":"2019-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"HeidelbergCement first cement company to receive approval for science-based CO2 reduction targets","emissions_rank":6,"language":"English","article_category":"Sustainability","preview_text":null,"article_url":"https:\/\/www.heidelbergcement.com\/en\/pr-13-05-2019","pdf_url":null,"error_text":"","carbon_in_title":1,"carbon_in_text":1,"relations":[],"entities":[]}
